[That said, my understanding is that very few people are appropriately educated enough to do safe cluster ballooning, and the priest, from the sound of it, was a beginner who almost certainly didn‚Äôt undergo the appropriate training and preparations for a trip of this type.](https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=89922191) That‚Äôs a really foolish and dumb mistake for him to make, but he wasn‚Äôt so dumb as to decide to randomly strap himself to a bunch of balloons when it had never been safely done before or conceived of or something like that. It was a (somewhat) established practice with some rules and expertise involved that he (pretty foolishly) severely underprepared for\n\nI think it‚Äôs also worth noting that the priest wasn‚Äôt so dumb as to attempt to fly over the Atlantic Ocean or any major bodies of water. The trip still shouldn‚Äôt have ever been attempted to begin with, but [the guy‚Äôs intended trajectory was to fly from the coast in a westbound direction over nothing but land, further into Brazil](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Adelir_de_Carli_flight.jpg). Where his body was found was east of his starting point, almost exactly opposite his planned course. It seems like he had a poor grasp on how to weather different meteorological conditions, owing to his inexperience with cluster ballooning\n\nEDIT: The priest was also allegedly an experienced skydiver, but I'm unable to find a source beyond his Wikipedia page and various news articles on this incident that all mention that fact about him in passing. Skydiving and cluster ballooning are presumably two very different beasts, but I wouldn't be surprised if whatever logistical/technical areas of overlap between the two airborne navigation activities there were led him to erroneously think he would be completely fine attempting his cluster ballooning trip",

Pieces of balloon were later reported floating in the sea off the coast.[11]\n\nCarli's flight equipment included a parachute, helmet, waterproof coveralls, GPS device, mobile phone, satellite phone, flotation device chair, aluminum thermal flight suit, and at least five days of food and drinking water. His training for the stunt included jungle survival and mountain climbing courses, but apparently did not include instruction on the use of his GPS navigation device. On April 20, the priest's last contact with the military police occurred during the night, when he was about 16 miles from the islands of Tamboretes, off the coast of S√£o Francisco do Sul, Santa Catarina, Brazil. The priest called from his cell phone to request help determining his coordinates and to ask them to contact the authorities. Two days after the flight, a Penha (SC) Fire Department commander familiar with the situation put the missing priest's chances of still being alive at 80%.[10] The Brazilian Navy called off the ocean search on April 29, saying the chances of finding de Carli alive in the ocean were \"very remote\".[12]\n\nOn July 4, 2008, the lower half of a human body was found floating on the ocean surface by an offshore oil rig support vessel about 100 km (62 mi) from Maca√©. After the remains were initially identified from the clothing as those belonging to Carli, DNA tests confirmed they were his on July 29, 2008 after a comparison was made with DNA samples from Carli's brother.‚Äù",
