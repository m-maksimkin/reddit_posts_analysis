However, the Republic of Texas was territory of Mexico, a sovereign country. When the US seized Mexican territory, the two countries went to war. Upon the surrender of Mexico, and the passing of the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo between the two countries, the US joint resolution of annexation was effected by the ceding of territory from Mexico to the US. \n\n*Hawaiian Nationals owed no allegiance to the Republic of Hawaii or Territory of Hawaii, and owes no allegiance to the United States.
