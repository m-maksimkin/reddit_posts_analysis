Clearly Rivera got stabbed but it's unclear who did it or how severe it was. Jay Z plead guilty to a lesser charge because he was facing 15 years and given his music, recent gun charges, image he portrayed as a gangster...a deal that results in probation is the safer bet. Also a 5 inch blade is pretty big a being stabbed in the belly often kills. \n\nWhile there's no shortage of rappers who were actually criminals many are storytellers who at best were petty crooks. Even some who surround themselves with hoodlums for street cred are still just rock and roll gangsters. I strongly recommend people dig into the lives and backgrounds of rappers, especially the ones who got big in the 90s. While many did grow up in the projects, many had parents who were hard working regular people. If you listen to underground rap songs you can also see significant differences in the lyrical maturity and ability to get mass appeal of those vs main stream rappers. MFs in the 90s especially really made a business out of rap music.",

So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, \"No the fuck this nigga did not...\" I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted. [...] There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control. [...] I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again.\"\n\nNotice how Jay-Z describes the events leading up to the stabbing and the events immediately following but never actually states that he stabbed someone. He skips right over it (\"the next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose...\")\n\nAnd in that last sentence, he implies that a situation occurred (removing blame) and that he was just caught up in that situation (rather than saying he directly caused the situation by stabbing someone).  \n\nDude takes zero accountability for his actions.",

Cops also tricked me into giving them my phone where they went through my notes and found receipts for selling a half ounce of coke, and half ounce of shrooms among other things. I got 4 felonies all together. My PD said even though its my first offense he could maybe get me a year in county. I fired him on the spot and got a lawer. He was amazing and even got his mentor to help with my case. I was looking at 4 years and 8 months in prison if i got the book thrown at me. He got me out on 3 years probation no programs or anything and only spent 3 and half weeks in jail. Im Mexican but I am white passing and id be a fool to think white privilege didnt come into play as well. After sentencing his mentor came up to me and said i should be in prison right now and ill never forget that or the miracle that just played out before me. My case was also this particular judges very last case before retiring. I figure he also didnt want to ruin some kids life as his last act of judicial service",
