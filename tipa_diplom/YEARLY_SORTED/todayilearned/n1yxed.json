But he was rebuffed.\n\nAgain, though, he did do a lot of things right. He only went by his code name, never met anyone in person and used drop sites with coded dates to drop off the compromised information.  \n\nHe even lucked out when a CIA agent was found to be a spy and some of the information (specifically on double agents on the Soviet side) had been linked to that guy, giving him cover for some serious compromising. \n\nWhat did him in was the knowing of specific acts they could not tie to the CIA agent, plus the FBI paying Russians significant money to give info on any double agent. \n\nThe evidence they turned over was a voice recording. One of the agents investigating had remembered the voice but couldn't place it. However, then the man referenced a Patton quote and the agent remembered that Hanssen had referenced that same quote in the past.\n\nSuch a fascinating case.",

            "text": "This entire story is told by Eric O'Neill on his book titled 'Gray Day,' which I recently read.\n\nEric is a former FBI agent who was tasked to work alongside with Robert Hanssen on a made up unit that, like the title says, was made up with the purpose of catching moles in the FBI. However, the true purpose of this unit was to catch the spy with the code name 'Grey Day' who had been spying on the US for decades, and the FBI thought that spy was Robert Hansson, the man they put in charge of this fake unit.\n\nVery interesting story that reads like a fiction spy novel that I strongly recommend.",

They had thought he was in the Air Force his entire career.\n\nHe was so unassuming and spoke with our class once. I remember his talk so vividly, even though it happened about 25 years ago. It was amazing, yet so sad that these defectors would have to leave their entire families behind and the American government would set them up in their new life.\n\nHe also told us that he would brief President Reagan regularly and his mental decline in dementia was very evident by 1986 to everyone who had contact with him.\n\nSo, I just decided to Google that teacher to see what he's up to now and he died of COVID last month.
