Lovecraft, you must appreciate that he was a sickly, shut in momma's boy. He was homeschooled, the victim of isolation, gaslighting, and frequent psychological abuse.\n\n>His father passed away in an insane asylum, his brain rotted out by syphilitic psychosis. His hypochondriac mother became obsessed with the possibility that her husband had passed the infection on to her, and thence to their son, and she never let her son forget this obsession.\n\n>Syphilis is literally an inherited blood-curse, and having sex with \"the wrong sort of women\" is literally how Winfield Lovecraft contracted it. It's not hard to imagine that being constantly reminded of these facts by the women who raised him had a very messy effect on young Howard's development.\n\n>To the nearest approximation, he was afraid of EVERYTHING.\n\n>He was afraid of public transportation. He was afraid of doctors. He was afraid of mice. He was afraid of rainy days. He was afraid of seafood. He was afraid of worms. He was afraid of romance. He was afraid of the stars. He was afraid of statues. He was afraid of certain phases of the moon. He was afraid of songbirds. He was afraid of fireflies. He was afraid of hills. He was afraid of geometry. He was afraid of flutes. He was afraid of gambrel roofs.\n\n>And, yes, he was afraid of people who were different from himself.\n\n>Part of his genius is his ability to make the reader, just for a few minutes, afraid of those things too. It is from his sense of omnipresent fear and alienation that the genre of cosmic horror was codified. I feel that, without his own negative attitudes, his work simply would not have had the edge that made it great.\n\n>Was he racist, as we today would understand the term? Absolutely.\n\n>Was he closed-minded and xenophobic, as his peers in the 20s and 30s would understand? Again, yes. There are multiple examples in his surviving correspondence in which friends like Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith suggest that he'd benefit from spending more time broadening his horizons and realizing that the people of whom he is afraid are not so different from himself.\n\n>(I like to imagine him sitting in his Providence study, reading Robert E. Howard's recommendation that he actually sit down and have a conversation with a Jewish person or an immigrant or a woman, and scoffing at its absurdity. This scene is then followed by a Gilligan's-Island-style jump-cut to his own wedding to Jewish immigrant Sonia Greene.)\n\n>Was he actively and maliciously hateful? I would say \"no\". He absolutely suffered from xenophobia... but only in the same sense that he suffered from nyctophobia and thalassophobia and ophidiphobia and icthyophobia. In his later years, he made serious efforts to overcome these things. His writing shows a definite progression from juvenile edgelord poems that were just an excuse to rhyme things with the word \"Nigger\"; to works that were, in Lovecraft's own awkward way, calls for inclusivity and brotherhood.\n\n>Of his horror fiction, the work that probably seems the most overtly racist to modern eyes would be \"The Horror at Red Hook\", featuring phrases like \"The devil-worshipping Yazidis\" and \"unclassified Asian dregs\". But looking past that language, one realizes that it's a treatise on the negative social consequences of the mistreatment of immigrants (as relevant in 2018 as it was in 1925), and that its protagonist is also an immigrant. \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\" highlights the author's fear of miscegenation (he had a panic attack when he learned that one of his great-grandparents was Welsh), but it's also a critique of colonialism - South Seas trader Obed Marsh makes a career out of taking advantage of technologically inferior indigenous cultures, until he encounters a technologically superior culture and is similarly taken advantage of. The novella \"At The Mountains of Madness\" is mostly about the alienation caused by recent discoveries in geology and zoology, but ends with the narrator concluding that even monstrous prehistoric beings which look nothing at all like humans, but which have shared values like scientific curiosity and a love of art, should be respected as peers.\n\n>Were these efforts successful? You might quite reasonably say \"no\". There is an argument to be made that exotic \"noble savage\" and \"inscrutable oriental\" and \"magical Indian chief\" stock characters are still negative portrayals even if they were intended as positive. Conversely, for an example of when Lovecraft deliberately tries to portray racism as a negative character trait, see the protagonist of The Temple, or the antagonist of The Electric Executioner, or the above-mentioned Horror at Red Hook.\n\n>I'm going to state this again, just so there's no opportunity for misunderstanding: I'm not saying that H.P. Lovecraft was not a racist. Even when he was TRYING not to be a racist, he still comes across as pretty racist by modern standards. It is a truism that someone who goes looking for something to be offended by WILL find something, but with an author like Lovecraft, one REALLY doesn't have to look very hard.\n\n>If this prevents you from enjoying his work, well, your tastes are your own. De gustibus non est disputandum. It is your right not to like them, and your right not to read them. But if you feel that their failure to pass 21st century standards of ideological purity mean that NOBODY should be allowed to enjoy them, and that they belong on the bonfire with the works of Tolkien and LeGuin and Campbell and Shelley and Shakespeare, I must disagree in the strongest possible terms.",

Lovecraft had little confidence in much of his work and would often leave manuscripts to rot in a drawer after one or two rejections by publishers.

He’d come from a wealthy family which, in his youth, met financial ruin. He died destitute because he simply couldn’t or wouldn’t adjust his mindset to that of the working class. Lovecraft died painfully of stomach cancer, in miserable poverty, thinking himself a failure as a writer, because he simply lacked the desire to market himself.",
