They were shown three phrases with Japanese characters and asked to identify the correct one.  A statistically significant portion of the group beyond random selection answered correctly.  The assumption was that since enough people in the UK knew the answer and the number was above the threshold, the theory was proved.\n\nI think this is part of trans personal psychology.

Can’t find in the link you posted.\n\nI think it’s much more likely that the monkeys are trying to get iodine or some kind of something from salt that would protect them from Hiroshima/Nagasaki after effects.. or even Fukushima. Animal instinct is extremely powerful and in a lot of ways still evades human understanding. \n\nNow that I think of it, Japan has been hyper radiated over the last 100 years. Some kind of Godzilla creature forming beneath the sea is not so far fetched at this point lol 😬",

I was taking Anthropology, in college.\n\nThe story as it ran, back then, in 1965, was that as the boats came in with provisions for the monkeys, some crates of sweet potatoes, broke open on the beach. The potatoes that fell into the water, started being picked up by the monkeys, in the surf.\n\nIt was @ this instant in time, that the monkeys had encountered salted sweet potatoes & started  teaching the other monkeys, how to wash the potatoes in the surf. They already would go into the surf, because they lived on the island. They would all come onto the beach & surf, when the boats bringing food, landed on the beach.\n\nThat is my story & I'm sticking to it!\n\nMy wife by way of Alabama & Louisiana, taught my Southern Ass, the \"proper\" way to eat sweet potatoes & Yams.\n\nShe also, (by way of NJ, through her Mother) taught me how to eat mashed Rutabagas!\n\nYou peel the Rutabagas, then boil them until tender enough to mash & butter down. From that time, forward, I will always prefer mashed Rutabagas  w/Real Butter, over my Southern 'taters  w/real butter, which comes in a very close, 2nd place !\n\nAnd I just \"drooled\" on the keyboard !",
