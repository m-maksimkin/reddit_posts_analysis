Meanwhile we’re all like “so what did you do?” He said nothing… within minutes he was back there, I was, even had Grandma in tow and there was already a lineup of 10+ people at this ATM within minutes. Word travels quick. Anyways, I took out my daily limit of $400 (getting $800), I guessing everyone else and their grandmas did too and the machine was out of money within minutes. \n\nThis was a machine that gave $10 bills so I’m guessing the machine was down to 10s and someone filled the wrong tender in the wrong spot. \n\nSome of months pass and the bank called me. They asked if I recall anything wrong with an ATM transaction on said day as there may have been issues with the machine. My response? “I’m sure if the machine shorted me I would have noticed” I’m sure Grandma’s response was even less. \n\nIt ended there",

            "text": "Reminds me of one of my old adventures.\n\nBack in the heyday of 1980's video arcades I discovered a money-generating trick that I exploited the hell out of. Back then it was common practice to put a dollar into a change machine and you'd get back four quarters. Today, change machines are universally one type: You feed the dollar into a slot which then pulls in the dollar and spits out your quarters. They all looked [like this](https://preview.redd.it/8o77shwya9171.jpg?auto=webp&s=db90e12be183b077276909be8946ec11a934baa2). But back then there was another kind of change machine. It looked almost identical to that one, but instead of a slot where you fed in a dollar it had a tray where you would lay a dollar flat, then push in the tray to feed the machine and it would spit out your quarters. It wasn't as reliable as the other one but for awhile they were pretty ubiquitous. One day (at an arcade in Long Branch, NJ) I watched an arcade attendant fix a tray that had gotten jammed. I noticed he could flip a switch inside the change machine and it would dispense four quarters, but only if the tray was pushed in. Makes sense. But I also noticed that the tray didn't have to be FULLY pushed in in order to engage that switch. After the attendant left I put a dollar in the tray, then held a quarter up on edge against where the tray goes in, and pushed. The tray went in all the way minus the thickness of a quarter. I held it there for about 10 seconds while the machine thought about life, then it spit out my quarters. I pulled the tray back out...and my dollar was still there.\n\nI repeated this with several of the other change machines in the arcade and it worked on most of them. Any time I went to an arcade I'd look for the \"tray-loader\" change machines and it often worked. I found that the change machines that looked old and worn-out were often more successful. I'm guessing that there's some kind of bushing or something that wears down over time and if you find one with a worn-enough bushing it works. Over the years (not too many, as the arcades switched to the more reliable slot-loading mechanism pretty quickly) I probably absconded with a couple hundred dollars worth of quarters. I don't feel too bad about it since 100% of those quarters went right back into the arcade machines.",

What he is describing is doing a transfer in stand-in (while the bank is offline or unable to authorize transactions because it is doing nightly processing), and somehow the transfer is happening and the debit (from his credit account) is not occurring, but the credit (to his savings) is. For the network I work on, transfers and deposits are not authorized during stand-in, and withdrawals are approved either up to a certain cumulative amount (usually $200) or based off a balance for the account sent by the bank before it starts nightly processing. Even if it were a bug, I don't know how it would have gotten missed, all transactions that go through this system (called the switch) are recorded and a record is sent to the bank on a reconciliation report the next day.\n\nSomeone in the bank's balancing group must have dropped the ball to not have found this, or it was a serious software bug that the switch vendor never tested for.\n\nIn my experience (10 years) the closest thing is someone making a deposit, getting it declined and getting their money back, but still having the deposit credited to their account.

You also haven't been taking out extreme amounts (maybe the occassional thousand or so) so it's reasonable to assume you didn't know it was an exploitable issue.

I did not have an overdraft.   Curious, I went back to another bank machine later that night to mess around.  Back then there were 3 \"account\" buttons on am ATM: chequing, savings and other.  Simply by playing around I soon discovered that I was able to transfer money from the \"other\" account into my chequing account.  Note that I did not have an \"other\" account....\n\nI started transferring the max of $10,000 and managed to get my balance up to $140,000 before it stopped working.   I then took out around $300.\n\nDays went by and the balance remained.   Then I made a mistake: I went into a branch to have my \"passbook\" updated with the recent transactions.   The teller obliged but was suspicious of the large transactions and asked about them.   I said it was from my father's business or some other bullshit.\n\nDays later I got a call from the bank and they asked me to show up in person and asked some questions.  They removed the funds and made me pay back the $300.   Well, my mom had to pay it back because I was an unemployed and broke student....\n\nThe bank explained that it was a glitch due to some IT work on the ATM network.\n\nFor a few days it felt so wonderful having all that money in the bank.   Money may not buy happiness, but it can easily annihilate so much that makes us unhappy, as well as creating potential to do things that we could not normally do due to a lack of money.   The coolest feeling at the time was viewing a Porsche 911 that was on display in a mall and thinking, heck I could by that with cash if I wanted!   \n\nI think I still have the passbook around somewhere as a souvenir.",

I called them to try to sort it out because I didn't want it affecting by credit rating, but after some run around from different people, they finally just insisted it wasn't an error. Further, the balance would get paid automatically every month.\n\nI couldn't figure it out - the company was this \"Board of Trade\" for the city I lived in, but I was just some kid in university. So after giving up on getting it cancelled, I finally decided to use it. I filled up my tank, the card was accepted and I never got the bill. So, I started using it to fill up all the time, figuring eventually they would wise up and send me a bill, but no bills ever came.\n\nAfter a year, I started using it to buy my friends gas (and pocket their cash), buy stuff in the store at the gas station and even drove out of my way to find places that had auto service to get my oil changed. This was Canada, so they didn't sell alcohol at the gas station, but I would buy entire flats of soda and a dozen bags of chips pretty much any time I gassed up, just to give them away. By the end, I was easily putting $1000-1500 a month on the card, and never saw a bill. Finally, after a little more than 3 years, it got declined one day. I was so sad.\n\nNever got any kind of bill or anything. I'm pretty sure I charged upwards of $30 to 40k in the 3 years I was using the card, and easily pocketed around $5-10 in cash by selling gas to my friends at a discount. Made university so much easier...always wondered what the story behind me getting it was, but I guess I'll never know.",

I then emailed them had an exchange and didn't hear anything again. I followed it up a few days later with another person who then again went radio silent. Basically each time I was asked was I sure it wasn't meant to be two payments. I then called up twice and got the same routine of \"Are you sure it wasn't meant to be this amount in two payments?\" Our contracts are clear about how redunancies work and the first payment was the amount someone in my position for how long I worked at the company should be getting, the second payment was double what I should be getting. Anyway since I wanted to keep the money I felt like at this point I had done enough to show I was trying to do the right thing so I sent a final email explaining how after speaking with X,Y, and Z they said I was given amount A over two payments and I'm happy with their explanation.

We immediately bought a couple cartons of cigarettes, a bunch of booze, and went out to eat/drink each day our friend was in town. Two days after our friend flew back home, the money disappeared.
