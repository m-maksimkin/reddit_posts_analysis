The amount of manipulation that happens between the chase is unfortunate - it’s the conditioning that sets us up to get disappointed with the opposite sex. Someone has to be the villain it seems and someone has to be the victim. It’s such an old story. It’s my belief we choose our drama and we choose our to hurt by our expectations of others. It’s like a kindergarten perspective of feeling rejected and or confused. Teeth inside a vagina and a worm 🐛 offering immortality. Cmon now that has Freud written all over it.  Me a woman: the snake entered me only to bite off my cervix rendering me infertile. Horny,  Manipulate, justify, blame and repeat. \nMen:- I want sex with her but my penis isn’t big enough - she’s a monster. Im powerless. Our society is conducive psychosis around sex and genitalia.",

When I was in a PhD program on the Ancient Near East I got to take a class on Egyptian religion and mythology with a professor who was in his 80s so he could barely hear but he was a very grandfatherly professor in many ways and he absolutely loved doing that. I remember within the first weeks of class he had already asked \"what's up with all this masturbation?\" to a room of half freshmen undergrads who all looked visibly uncomfortable at first talking about a subject that lo and behold is actually important. To the Egyptians Amun literally jerked off the Nile into existence so there is absolutely a very important discussion about what this means in relation to how they saw the world, but man is it fun to look at the faces of those undergrads as they awkwardly tried to decide whether they were meant to answer the question seriously or not. \n\nAlso since the professor was very hard of hearing you could always tell who the grad students and undergrads were just by how they asked questions. Undergrads would ask their question, which would be followed by the prof yelling \"what?!\" and them repeating the process multiple times because they were too scared to just shout at him. Grad students just shouted at him because we all knew him already so we knew he literally couldn't even hear it if we didnt shout. That only made the awkwardness even funnier.",
