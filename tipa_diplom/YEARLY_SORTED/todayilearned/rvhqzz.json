Other funerals I have been to, the eulogies have always been written by close family members, but these were my nan's own words being read back to us. Knowing she sat there, alone in her flat, writing out her own eulogy - writing the words that I was hearing - it hit a lot differently.\n\nI lost my 3 remaining grandparents in the last 2 years, and despite current pandemic circumstances, not one death was Covid-related. It's very surreal, knowing I won't see them or talk to them again. Particularly my grandfather, who I was incredibly close to. He left me his watch and his sovereign ring, which I wear on a chain around my neck that his father (my great grandfather) made by hand. \n\nSorry to blab my own shit, I got a bit carried away. I know people find comfort in suicide, and in having that choice, but a person can never truly know the feelings and unanswered questions that get left behind once they are gone.

He would ask me to come along & spend the day with them. He was always up beat & happy around them. As time went on I got to know his exwife & a few if his friends. Eventually his exwife told me how they split up & how she totally destroyed his life, how she purposely tell stupid lies to be caught out with all the different men. Its like she was on a self destruct of their marriage. Where Ray did everything he could to hold it together, she did everything to destroy it. His family meant everything to him. But of course it all came tumbling down & he was left in a tiny room with only seeing his kids (who lived around the corner) once a week. Eventually he met Julie, Julie once was their baby sitter & had always had a thing for Ray & she set her sights on him. Things were looking good, he had got himself a decent paying job & now a girlfriend. I met a fella & moved across town & went working away. A year later I came back found Ray & Julie had bought a house together & has recently (3 months previously) just got married. I was made up for Ray, I knew what this meant to him. I went to visit them. I don't know what was going on but I could hear the argument before I got to the door. I knocked anyway. They let me in but carried on shouting at each other (to this day I've no idea what they were arguing about) but eventually instead of putting aside their argument for a visitor they asked me to leave & come back another time. 3 weeks later the headline in the newspaper was how the newlywed had hung himself on his 30th birthday. Apparently they carried on arguing & Julie went off to her mums & Ray hung himself from the top of the stairs from the attic. Poor Julie found like that sometime later. This was 32 years ago come the 30th of this month. Ray should have been having his happy ever after, he seamingly had his life back & the family he wanted/needed. I still think of him & I will probably always wonder why.",

Since 1996, six people have disappeared in the waters by Piha beach and no trace of them have been found.  \n\nIt wouldn't be too difficult to set it up so that I could massively overdose on sleeping pills and have the beach drag me out with the tide.  Chances are my body would never be found, and if it was found, no one would do an autopsy looking for pills.  Either way, my family and friends would think it's a case of \"misadventure\" rather than suicide; they would be saddened but not in the unique way that suicide mars people.  \n\nBleak, yeah?  \n\nBut here's the thing. In order to pull that off, I'd need to be able to: \n* Save up for a ticket to New Zealand\n* Buy a ticket for New Zealand\n* Pack for New Zealand\n* Rent a car & drive (or take a bus to Piha Beach)\n* Somehow procure a lethal dose of sleeping pills \n  * in a foreign nation\n  * or smuggle them through customs\n* Gain access to Piha beach during closed hours.  \n* Stay out of the sightline of any of the surf rescue\n* Time the tides right. \n\nAnd who knows, I might be so enamoured with the natural beauty and the destressing of being on vacation that I might just forget to kill myself entirely. \n\nCompare that to my suicide plan in Texas, which was: \n* Buy gun (22 minutes, according to latest estimates)\n* Shoot self in parking lot of gun store.  \n\nThe more elaborate and convoluted my suicide plan, the more oppertunities I'd have to turn back, to stop and get help - or to have help thrust upon me.  (Kiwis are friendly, especially on vacation, and I can't help but think perhaps on that bus ride to Piha, a Kiwi might be asking why, on a grand vacation to Earth's greatest paradise, I look like I'm on the verge of breaking out in tears.) \n\nI don't know if this guy with his guillotine was thinking along similar lines. Certainly this took more than one trip to the B&Q. Either way, the amount of pain that you would have to be in to follow through with such an elaborate plan has to be enormous.  Maybe he wanted help subconciously, maybe he didn't.  But I do think that the elaborate nature of the death suggests perhaps this wasn't as easy as deciding to die.",

Redditors: why do you think that he purposely went through with this extra step? My point being an overdose of pills would have done it, so why include this gruesome aspect? He knew that it would be incredibly upsetting for his father to find him like that. I’m thinking that there had to be underlying rage toward his father, he purposely wanted him to experience the horror of finding his body like that. Any thoughts? 🤔",
