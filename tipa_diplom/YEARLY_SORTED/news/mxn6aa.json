They see themselves as equally powerful with countries such as the USA and Germany in the last 20 years, and the reason for this is the current government.Yes, half of the country is stupid, they still see themselves in the 1600s and they think the Ottoman Empire continues. While half of the country thinks we need to improve by doing scientific studies (that's the right thing) The other half thinks we should use religion.But our country thinks the same on rare issues, and this is one of them. Armenians think their people were massacred by the Turks, but what they don't know is that they raided Turkish villages and killed women and children long before we attacked them. This is why we attack them. If we killed one Armenian among them, they killed 15 of us. This country does everything but admit its mistakes. And if the fact that we attacked them unjustly and killed millions of people in vain were true, we would gladly accept it. But this is not the truth.My only request from you is to show empathy and look not only to Armenian sources but also to Turkish sources written at that time. This article is definitely not a hate article against Armenians. I can talk about this issue with the Armenians in the comments, if they also accept it.[If there is a place that is not understood, I'm sorry English is not my native language:)].",

That's not recognised by them even though its a fact.\n\n\nNow compare all of that with saying, ow btw almost a 100 years now, the power before the last, killed a lot of people...as if the last power (atheist-communist) turkey didn't ban the freedom of religion and kill anybody that taught it, for get teaching it. You couldn't wear anything that identified you (specifically) as a muslim or you would be executed.\n\nThey even changed the LANGUAGE from Arabic letters to Latin letters, without any say from the people.\n\nAnd what's scarier than the ottomans, is that unlike the last period of the ottomans, the ruler was spear heading all what I said above. And 2 there are actually a lot of Turkish extreme people who still support communist turkey and don't recognise the crimes they committed.\n\n\nAnd I know just by saying the last part, many are gonna come after me talking bs about how Erdoğan isn't good in this or that....Erdoğan has done a lot of good things to turkey if you weren't bias. \n\n\nAnd is trying to do better for the Turkish people but many just hate him because he brought religion back and endorsed it. Culturally so on and so forth. I will give an example.\n\n\nTurkey has a deep history in archery. One of the Turkish kings a very long time ago privately bought a piece of land and gave it for archers up to \"the day of judgment\" which means forever.\n\n\nArchery is also deeply rooted in islam and it is one of the things we consider as good things for kids to learn. So they used to use that land for teaching archery, horse archery and hunting. But then it was developed further so they have lounges where they teach poetry, calligraphy and Islam which of course was a big no no by communist turkey so they disregarded it's historical importance and long history, and totally shut it down.\n\nAnd it was until Erdoğan came and actually opened up that historic sight for its intended purpose.\n\nDid I also mention that historically it was also meant for it to be free of charge? I didn't, well it was free of charge, and now it is still free of charge.\n\nAnd guess what, Turkish archery has been revived, a lot of people go there to learn archery, horse archery, calligraphy among many other things. People are nice and it's free, also anybody can go there.\n\n\nYet you will find extremists who still complain about how the people there are religious. And how they \"ruin the atmosphere\" completely disregarding that Turkish archery has a lot of spirituality like ALL cultures that have history with archery.",

Like if it was accepted as a massacre, would that make the events somehow less disgusting? Whatever the word is, still 800K per Turkish sources and 1 to 1.5 million according to Armenian sources died including women and children. That is insane. So, who cares about a word? I don’t care what other countries define it as, what would make me happy is if we accept it as a country, learn from it, and move on. I have a feeling it would mean a lot more to Armenians if Turks accepted it.\n\nAdditionally, I was sick of Armenian Genocide being used as a political move. The only reason why previous presidents didn’t call it what it is was because they didn’t feel Armenian people were worth the trouble of severing ties with Turkey at times when US needed them for political reasons.  \n\nFinally, I have liked all the Armenian people that I have met in real life.
