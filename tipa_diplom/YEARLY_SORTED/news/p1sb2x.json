I empathize with those women and the trauma they have gone through, and making one issue more important than the other isn’t how I think we should approach this. \n\nI just think the death of thousands DOES warrant getting impeached over, and I believe this event is a microcosm of our country’s values, where the death of thousands is almost acceptable, but inappropriate touching / harassment is the line.\n\nI hope this makes sense.",
