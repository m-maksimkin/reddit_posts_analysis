Also, she will be celebrated for her behavior by conservative media.  \n\nWhen a Civil War erupts in this country, it will be because liberals will have had enough of putting up with conservatives breaking our laws and our commonly understood and agreed upon social contract.  \n\nRepublicans have become the party of flaunting our rules and laws and purposefully committing and getting away with outrageous offenses.\n\nFuck them and all that they supposedly stand for!
