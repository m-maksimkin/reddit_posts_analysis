            "text": "Renting can be a good way to live cheap and avoid the wild housing market.  The downside now is the renter market is pointing at housing costs and going \"look at how expensive houses are.  You should pay more for rent because of that.\"...on old houses already fully paid off and it's just straight up profit with the rent checks.  \n\nI consider myself lucky enough to have gone through college and gotten into a well paying career before the wage stagnation and value of the dollar crashed.  Over two decades I was able to position myself well to be comfortable now.  But this was 20 years of work to get to this point, and the sad part is I worked general labor in a factory 20 years ago, and I had MORE buying power then than I do now with 20 years of work on a college degree and career advancement.  I didn't get to a better place.  All I did was keep up with inflation.\n\nMost of my friends are college graduates and in good careers.  Even so, nearly all of them are either dual income or buying a house and renting out rooms to make ends meet.  No one I know bought and owns a house on their own other than my brother who's making 6 figures.\n\nFor myself, I still rent and co-rent with 2 or 3 other people to keep my living expenses mild.  I don't see myself ever owning a home in the short term at all.  The sad part is 20 years ago as a general laborer, I had enough wealth and buying power with a generic job to literally buy and pay off a house entirely in around 5-6 years.  That was how much spending cash I had and excess cash I had after living expenses.  I could buy and pay off an entire house on my own in 5 years...with just a general labor job in a factory that required zero education and that anyone could have.\n\nI have the understanding of hindsight to recognize how absolute garbage the modern world is for people.  It really is terrible.  It's a world that REQUIRES a college education to even get pretty ok pay.  You can get into skilled trades and start up your own business.  There's a variety of means that can make decent cash.  But in general, an unskilled job, a general labor job, is wholly not capable of supporting a person the way it used to.  The game now is for young people to stick themselves into the career plan that keeps them financially comfortable and to avoid all other labor.  The problem is all that other labor has to be done too for society to work.  This is the problem we're facing now.  That employee pool doesn't want to work for nothing.  Ones that do work often work several jobs.\n\nBut there is a silver lining.  This recent pandemic has created an environment where people can demand higher wages.  It is now difficult to hire any labor under $15 to $20 per hour, minimum, and some areas that are dense in employee options are seeing wage requires heading towards $25 to $30 just to get people in the door.  People aren't even showing up for $20/hr.  And that really is what's driving the uptick in wages.  People are finally demanding a fair wage.  We're well past $15/hr as a minimum wage.  We're around $25/hr now, and that's where people are going for the definition of their need, which is awesome to see.  I hope it keeps up.  I hope people finally realize the power they have on companies for a fair wage.  Demand what you need to survive.\n\nOne counter argument I see is the whole \"back in my day, we didn't have...,\" and to some degree that is correct.  Modern life and society has a demand for some luxuries as the base definition of living, luxuries that were very much luxuries back in the day. But things like phones, computers, and internet are so ingrained into life that they have become a necessity.  You might not need a $1000 phone, but that's really the only stickler.  It's still needed.  Same with vehicles, insurance, gas, the need to commute longer distances from farther outside of a city to keep housing costs lower, all this stuff adds up.\n\nBut what's really needed to live a modern life?  That depends.  I don't have a family and rent with others to minimize my costs.  I have a loan on a vehicle because reliability is necessary.  My commute is ok at around 20 minutes.  I've optimized my life to function around $15/hr or $32k a year (pre-tax).  I make more than this, but my life structure is whittled down to the need of a $15/hr wage.  This covers rent, auto, gym membership, phone, some streaming services, and $100/mo for luxuries.  This does not include retirement savings.  This is one area I found extremely difficult to invest when not making enough money.  Just for a 401k and IRA, if you wanted to max out investments in those, you would need to double your income.  You need to be up around $30/hr to do this with no other changes to your lifestyle.  For my lifestyle, that requires a $65k/yr salary and still means no house.  The only real luxury I have is a modern car.  I still rent with several other people in shared living.  Even owning an apartment (1000 sq.ft. one or two bedroom) by myself is about a 2x increase in housing expenses.  So actually renting an apartment and being fully invested in retirement is around $72k salary, and I still have no extra on-hand cash at all besides the $100/mo budgeted.  For actual home ownership, a modern car, full vested retirement savings, and minimal luxuries, my salary requirement is around $85k.  If I wanted some wiggle room in spending cash for the year, for trips or anything at all for monthly expenses beyond the basics, I'm heading fast towards a $100k salary requirement.  So this modern world nearly demands a six figure income to own a home, to have a newer car, to have retirement savings, and to live with financial comfort.  That's the baseline for the American dream in the modern world.  Six figures, that's all it takes.\n\nWe can live with less, but everything is a choice of compromise.  My leanest living is around $12/hr, but I am perpetually broke doing it without a dime of excess, always renting with others, and I'd have zero retirement savings until the day I died.",

They did this multiple times, and the US income/savings rate actually increased dramatically. This artificially kept, and is still keeping, demand very high. Unfortunately, governments did not account for the fact that supply was actually in the recession that \"demand\" also should have been in, so we have had significant inflation ever since. This will likely abate when the COVID stimulus demand burns out or supply finally catches up, but recent wage increases may keep the inflation spiral running for a bit longer. \n\nOn top of this, US, State, and Local governments also added a whole new investment risk to residential real estate when they instituted eviction moratoriums. These policies essentially violated legal contracts, and many landlords were forced to house non-paying tenants for months to a year+, often ones who could pay but just chose not to. This added risk has to be accounted for in business cases going forward, so it is natural to see a spike in rent levels as soon as these moratoriums were lifted/deemed illegal.  \n\nIt should not be surprising to see 20% increases in rent across the board (\\~10% for eviction moratorium risk, \\~10% to combat inflation). This should normalize in the next 1-2 years as inflation eventually subsides to previous levels, but rents will \\[at least\\] pace inflation in perpetuity, so if that remains high, then rent increases will remain high.",

Zoning for single family homes did not expand housing stock fast enough.  Canada doesn't have enough tradesmen to meet its housing construction needs.  So we can talk about housing supply issues, but nothing gets done.  \n\nWhat I find interesting is that the housing demand side issues are silent from most discussions.  Domestic birth rates are below replacement in all first world countries.  We've used immigration as an outsourced reproduction method, but we could also control it to bring housing demand back down.  Japan doesn't have the housing demand issues largely because their population is aging and hollowing out.  We don't need infinite human growth and we likely don't have the energy reserves to provide for 7 billion people forever.\n\nAll the talk about money laundering and investment brokers is an attempt by neoliberals to mask the common answer to home price increases: prices are set where supply meets demand. But demand is from our immigration population growth.  I don't hate any ethnicities, but the first world's immigration policy is largely irresponsible as it increased housing demand without the ability for supply to properly match housing demand.",

Getting a development approved takes full compliance of every rule in the code, a process that lasts months and months because developers have to go through multiple rounds of review to fix these inconsequential details on their projects. One parking space short? -change the whole site plan to squeeze it in or remove units. One tree short of code requirements? Nope. Go back and shove it in somewhere. The amount of power municipal governments wield to stop people from building is insane and all of those hours spent by the plan reviewers as well as the consultants preparing and revising plans adds up.

No matter how shiny the iPhone or Telsa is, you need to pay rent first.\n\nPrices for property need to go up as a deterrend from leaving the rent market towards your own property.\n\nSome ape on r/wallstreetbets pointed out that there are, theoreticly, more homes to own then ever relative to the population. But since it's a business case to buy and then leave vacant to push prices to the moon by fake demand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGerman lawmakes push for \"property tax\" based on \"potential value\" because they need money and they only grasp the concept of big housing companies renting out flats in Berlin, and exactly doing that (leaving vacant).\n\nBut:\n\nThis means if you bought a property, with no intend to sell or to rent to someone else, you or your kids would suddenly have to pay immense taxes as if they'd sold or rented out and made a profit. \n\nUnrealized gains are a thing, but you always could sell parts of your stocks&shares, you can most likely not sell parts of a single family home. And take mortages on fully paid Property to PAY the tax that is adjusted to \"Marketprice\" seems unreal.\n\nSince the idea of owning property was that you are NOT dependend on marketprices...\n\nProperty that was bought 60 years ago, is fully paid of now is a potential liablity, since it's market price has dramaticly increased and especially governments are looking how to extract tax from the \"gains\" - instead of developing new areas for building.\n\nExploding housing prices are a result of  \"Cheap money\" and almost peak-productivity everywhere. You can not expect the production price of an iPhone dropping another 20% while the price goes up again.\n\nAnd there are not many companies that can offer \"money multiplication\". A market that demands constant growth  and a growth on growth has to be satisfied.\n\n So basic needs are targeted by those who can get money close to 0% interest.\n\nPeople say that any government action to stop  or deter realestate investments by companies, any action to limit asking-prices by applying fees and taxes is \"communism\"\n\nTo me the base everyday difference in \"Communism and Capitalism\" is that in communism you are not supposed to own property. Of course there are bigger economical differences, but that is my take on it.\n\nWell, if todays capitalism pushes people into a \"I rent a house, I rent my car, I rent my devices, I rent my media (streaming)...\n\nyou start to not \"own\" anything anymore. Like in Communism there will be an elite class that has the right to decide what happens. Instead of ideologic and political opportunism it'll be members will be found through financial opportunism and luck.\n\nCommon: It's enforced by the police.  And completely legal. If you can not pay double,triple the rent, you are evicted. No need for fake accusations to get you out of a home that a party-member desires.\n\nIf you don't pay, spotify shows adds, Netflix goes blank, your car and your phone get repo'ed by the companies you stop to pay monthly.",

Well, Rental Management has realized this and knew they can increase the prices because people were desperate.  And with renewals, the powers that be know that if the current resident doesn't like the renewal rate, some other desperate person will come in and pay more.

I do advocate for some type of governmental oversight of real estate prices with consequences for those that pump up the prices of housing markets. I also think that taxes should be prohibitively high to stop businesses from buying up all the houses in a real estate market. The housing prices and rents in my area have doubled in the past 18 months or so. Those looking for houses can't find a house, because businesses keep buying up the houses -- with cash. And the businesses pay whatever is being asked, even rediculously overpriced homes. This is a massive problem, and will only get worse without government intervention. The fix won't be easy, nor am I saying my proposals will solve all of our problems.

I’ve done every single thing right- and because I don’t have generational wealth (family help for college tuition or while attending, no help for down payments and no home to inherit ) I’ll never get ahead.

Every month is sits empty is 1/12 of a years rent that I have lost and I could have asked 1/12th lower and possibly gotten it rented without losing money. \n\nThats why Landlords are so careful to ask reasonable rent....vacancies are expensive. \n\nYou spend a minimum of one months rent on a vacancy, often more than one if it needs extensive reconditioning. Then if you ask too much rent and it sits empty a month...that is two or more months worth of rent you havent collected on a single vacancy.   \n\n\nRaising rent too much on an existing tenant can cause them to move, which can cost you 2-3 months rent as described above. \n\nIn short, we are not able to raise rent above demand because it causes more vacancy, and every vacancy....no matter how quickly you fill it is money you lose or spend for no good reason. \n\nThe best Tenant is the one who stays for ten years and you only have to raise the rent 1-2% per year to keep up with inflation. Those are the most profitable leases you have. I've literally acquired a building with a long term tenant in it.... raised their rent by small increments... and sold the property 15 years later with the tenant still in the apartment.

Few general issues \n1) Cost of ownership and property cost has gone up considerably over that period too. If you haven't noticed, property taxes, maintenance cost, and the like, tend to go up over time not down, as does the underlying value of the property. Its not like rent went up and property prices/maintenance costs (aka what I would need to pay if I wanted to buy something to rent out) went down. \n\n\n2) a huge swath of housing was sucked out of the market by people turning their property into hotels via Airbnb. This reduces supply considerably in major metropolitan areas and needs to be better addressed by regulation.\n\n\n3) There is a lot of NIMBY restraints on building in major cities. Supply constraints drive up prices up. \n\n\n4) Politicians have allowed foreign ownership of property that often times sits unused. You see this a lot in cities like NYC, where people in Russia and China are looking for foreign safehavens of their wealth. This drives up prices and reduces supply\n\n\n5) COVID slowed new construction reducing the amount of supply coming online. \n\nThe whole there are millions of unused houses argument kinda misses the where they are part. If some developer speculated and built a track of houses outside Phoenix and there isnt demand for that housing due to its location, t's just a misappropriation of resources. \n\nAs for rent control, you will run into huge problems if the incentive to build more housing, or perform maintenance on existing housing, is constrained by price regulation. While preventing excessive greed when it comes to housing is good IMO, it's dangerous if you get it wrong. A landlord who is not receiving enough in rent to cover cost will let a place go to hell. A builder who cannot make an adequate return on building a new building will not build. That is common sense.",

New paint ,rip up the carpet and add panelling to make it look \"fancy\". The quality will not be there though.

I cleaned constantly and I put terro baits out hoping they would stay gone but nope.

To have to pay to park in an open lot where it’s become a challenge to find a space after 5 pm is especially galling.

This is not because corporations are buying homes, not because foreigners are buying property. They are a small % of homeowners. \n\nIt's because it is illegal to build apartments and other denser housing in most of USA. Because of this, supply of homes is artificially restricted, while population and demand for homes keeps growing, leading to rent increases. \n\n[High rent costs in San Francisco? It is illegal to build apartments in 73% of the city.](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/ko0k0r/high_rent_costs_in_san_francisco_it_is_illegal_to/?sort=confidence)\n\nMajor portions of US cities are zoned with single family zoning, meaning you can only build single family homes there, no duplexes, apartments, etc. If US simply changed those zones to mix-use residential zoning, and also relaxed other regulations like setbacks, height restrictions, parking requirements, etc. then more supply of housing will be built in closer proximity, and since number of houses increase, rents will go down. \n\nPrime example of how less restrictive regulations on housing supply, leads to cheap rent is Tokyo. Contrary to what people believe, even as Japan's population is stagnating, population of Tokyo is still growing to this day due to urbanization. Yet they still have cheap rents and cheap property prices. \n\nThey achieved this by having very lax residential zoning laws, that permit all types of housing. \n\n[How an Average Family in Tokyo Can Buy a New Home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGbC5j4pG9w)\n\n[Why Is Japanese Property So Affordable?](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/pzzhcy/why_is_japanese_property_so_affordable/)\n\n[America's big cities are turning into housing catastrophes.

Since billionaires have been parking their money in real estate that is often left vacant, that has reduced supply to critical levels. In addition, when in this state, it is actually *more profitable* for a landlord to leave some apartments vacant in order to keep local demand above this critical threshold. Normally, property taxes and loan interest charges provide sufficient ongoing cost to vacancies to motivate filling them. But the combination of historically low interest rates and the low property tax ratio means it's very cheap to hold on to vacant properties. In fact, with interest rates below inflation rates, there's *huge* pressure to convert capital away from cash and into tangible assets like real estate.\n\nHonestly it seems like the only way out of this is a dramatic increase in the federal interest rate base. This would immediately \"crash the economy\" (i.e. cause the Dow to drop 20-30%) because the trillions being made by billionaires would suddenly lose an essential piece of their cash cow. But it would also make it *much* less profitable to hold on to real estate as an asset, thus increasing supply and reducing costs to normal people.\n\nI know everyone likes to complain that the richest people made trillions during the pandemic. But regardless of your views on that, **why the fuck** is the US treasury content only taking a 0.125% ([zero point one two five percent](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/fomc-meeting-recap-january-2022)) cut of this!? It seems painfully obvious that the government is in no position to be giving nearly interest-free loans to the largest banks, who in turn pass them on to the richest individuals, while at the same time having a historically high national debt and failing to pay for even basic measures like infrastructure maintenance and healthcare. IMHO it can only be explained by widespread systematic corruption of the people meant to regulate this industry and the politicians that are supposed to be leading this country.",

Corporate Money: No limits on commercial real estate or new residential construction. All other residential real estate limited to only being able to buy after 1 year unsold. Penalties for any empty residence not on market set to same standard as vacation homes.\n\n2. Foreign Investor: Banned from everything except commercial real estate or new residential construction. Penalties for any empty residence not on market set to same standard as vacation homes.\n\n3. Private Money Non Primary Residence: No limits commercial real estate or new residential construction. No limit on buying existing residential apartment buildings. All other residential real estate other than primary residence is limited to 5 units and only being able to buy after 6 months unsold. Penalties for empty units not on market or units above 5 that were not new builds are set to same standard as vacation homes.\n\n4. Primary Residence: First time home buyers are only ones able to submit an offer for first week. All others seeking it as a primary residence will then have up to month 6 before competing with investment money.\n\n5. Federal Zoning Efforts: Federal government encourage higher zoning density via federal funds. Those could entail direct payments to local governments that raise or have existing high density, expedite permitting, or waive fees. Tax credits to individuals that install accessory dwelling units on primary residence property for rent.\n\n6. State Zoning Efforts: Similar actions as Federal plus emphasizing state resources towards higher density areas.\n\n7. Local Zoning Efforts: Ban or severely limit ability to transfer existing housing stock that is not a primary residence into a hotel stock via things like AirBNB. Modify Single Family Zoning exclusion areas to allow missing mid-level housing like is readily available in European cities. Can still build single family homes but stop banning any other type of housing in residential areas.\n\n8. Urban Building Codes: under 6 units follow the IRC instead of the IBC, Remove all parking minimums, Eliminate minimum lot sizes, maximum FAR limits and resize setback requirements to what the fire department deems appropriate for safety, relax residential zoning to allow up to 6 units and some commercial uses by right. Light commercial (office uses, small retail) could follow IRC as well.\n\n9. Federal Regulations: Simplify a national building code that would be enforced by central government. Added complexity of many different state and local codes is delaying construction and raising costs. Universal standard would also encourage factory automation of a form of plug and play integrated materials for homes that could be adapted to local lot conditions. The more work that can be done by robots elsewhere the less that would need done on site.\n\n10. Vacation Homes: Penalize ownership of additional homes that are not being offered for sale or rented out for use through a scaled increase of property taxes. Second home x2. Third home x3. And so forth. Possibly even higher penalties for vacation homes in areas zoned for higher density.\n\n11. HOA: Change associated Covenants, Codes, and Restrictions to allow installation of ADU.\n\n12. Immigration: Specific New Construction Visas helping allow skilled immigrant workers address a critical manpower shortage.\n\n13. Homeless or Working Poor: Adopt International Residential Code standard of a minimum habitable square footage of 120 with minimum lot size 320 to facilitate housing options such as single bedroom motels being turned into apartments or condos.\n\n14. Occupancy: Increase maximum occupancy for larger square footage places to be in line with the minimum square footage requirements to facilitate intergenerational living.\n\n16. Materials: Incentivize via tax credits greener or sustainable new building materials such as precast concrete slabs, recycled plastics, reclaimed wood, recycled steel frames, hempcrete, ferrock, timbercrete, and so forth.\n\n17. Vacant Land: Increased property tax rates for vacant unused land scaled to zone density for where it is located. Lower property tax rates back to normal if vacant land is turned towards a public use benefit such as community or beautification garden, play space, green space, or public art installation.",

If they evict us, they get no money while they look for someone new, and when they do find someone new, they risk them doing the same.\n\nI’m trying to figure out how a strike would work, here.  If we can get landlords and real estate people to put pressure on the government alongside us, we might actually see laws get changed.\n\nGoals would probably involve 1) MASSIVELY higher taxes on vacant homes, like vacation homes or homes held purely for the investment.  If someone owns 2-4 properties, taxes get higher- not enormously so, but enough that landlords find it untenable to run massive organizations.  Beyond 10 properties, it becomes impossible to be a landlord without getting tax breaks by renting low-income or affordable housing.  \n\nMaybe even dictating that when a home is sold, 60% or more of the increased value must be given as tax (in addition to the already high property taxes).  If a home is lived in for less than half the time (verifiable by determining whether its someone’s permanent address) ALL (or nearly all, like 95%) gains made in the sale relative to the purchase must be paid.  This’d drive prices down, but the tax is directly proportional to the gains made on the property.\n\n2) Government built housing, a la Vienna.  See the Gravel Institute video for more details.\n\n3) In the event of foreclosures, the government either ensures that houses are sold at reasonable rates (enough to recoup the mortgage, but not whatever the market is willing to pay).  \n\n4) In the event that a house is abandoned, there is some way that house is marked so that if someone wants to claim and renovate it, they can (though they’d have to pay property taxes on it from the moment they claim it).\n\n5) If a house is left vacant for some interval, it legally becomes abandoned and can be claimed as described above.  The same goes for apartments and condos- can’t claim that an entire building is lived in if you have one tenant.",

How do we save for retirement, invest, get ahead at all in life. I’m 31 years old and even on a comfortable six figure income with thousands of dollars in savings, a mortgage for a single family home is still out of reach. The rents in my area are so high that someone making $120k a year will still pay 50% of their income after taxes for a 1 bedroom apartment. This system is broken.",

            "text": "So. You will see a concerted effort on the part of rental corporations attempting to do what rich people have done for years. Make the poor and middle class think that they're the problem. Using skewed statistics to say corporations are a small part of the whole and that the highest percentage is \"mom and pop\" renters. This is not the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. This is garbage to deflect from their predatory practices, blame regular people, and try to convince you the corporations are right (enter another partial truth statistic here jerks).\n\nWhere are the largest migrations going to (say Jacksonville, FL)? What entities are doing the lion's share of the buying (many times sight unseen), then turning them into high rent housing? The rental corporate ownerships are trending higher and higher in key locations. Narrow down the geography to those areas and you'll find that their small piece of the pie isn't really that small. (Enter another partial statistic here jerks)\n\nWho else will they blame? Millenials and young families, because it's their fault for wanting to live there in the first place. More garbage to get you off their richness and to fight against the poor and less fortunate. \n\nWho else? Home builders. Now it's the fault of home builders for not building enough houses (enter another statistic here jerks), and so corporate renters really \"have no choice\" but to raise rents. Oh, we forgot they're buying houses left and right to charge high rents and keep them off the market. Homeowners rarely say, \"no, no, you're offering too much, and it'll artificially raise property values\" when all they can see are $$ in their faces.\n\nCorporations REITS were given so much latitude during the 2008 recession to buy, get tax breaks, make their own rental rules to get as much money out of renters it should be criminal.\n\nIn case it wasn't clear:\n\n* \"The rich lead us to war and then stand back to let the poor and lower classes fight it out\"\n* \"The biggest lie the rich have been able to pull off is getting us to believe the poor and middle class are the problem\"",
