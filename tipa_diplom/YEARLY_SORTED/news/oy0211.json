The other side thinks YOU are racist bigoted and brainwashed..the politicians on YOUR side want supreme power over everyone and YOU won’t listen to them.. the only part that’s true is the last one, no one listens to the other perspective because you know they won’t.. we’ll be the first. Go find someone and have them explain their perspective and try to understand it, not disprove it..you might learn something or at the very least you can see their point of view and stop fighting .. we can realize we just think the same thing of the other side, and that’s just keeping the focus away from where it needs to be. What are they doing?? It’s right in our faces too, we need to start listening to others before we get so separated that we can’t. This goes to both sides… if you believe the problem is on one side, don’t worry, it will fix itself if people just start paying attention more. People need to give other people more credit, we’re all very smart just VERY distracted.. If you don’t want to have conversations because THEY don’t listen,  you missed my whole point and you’re part of the problem in my opinion.. fighting solves NOTHING it just escalates things until one side is taken out… don’t be part of the problem. Start listening to other perspectives. We make better decisions with more information and perspectives. Half of the country isn’t out to get the other half, they’re afraid the other half is  after them, and it’s all a big distraction from the mess of incompetent career politicians all trying to cover their own assets while rushing through legislation to hang on to their power. It’s so obvious, but we’re all so focused and worried about winning an argument, that we say the most ridiculous things that don’t even matter, just to come out on top. It’s not about being right it’s about understanding the other perspective. You really think that THAT many people are THAT evil or callous? Or is this just what everyone that’s on your side knows to be a fact. \n\n\nIf you think this is post is against your side, then you are a paranoid person, and you need to start trying to look at things through other’s perspective. \n\nOne more time..PERSPECTiVE\n\nHave a great day! ✌️😎",
