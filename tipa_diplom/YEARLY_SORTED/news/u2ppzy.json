However, he also said:\n\n>Why did I rob banks? Because I enjoyed it. I loved it. I was more alive when I was inside a bank, robbing it, than at any other time in my life.

But there seems to be a problem with policing in general in this country where cops are really bad at going after the \"bad guys\" but they are really, really good at covering up police misconducts ranging from dealing to killing OR going after poor people. LAPD is also blatantly lazy. They'll \"temporarily\" close some stations and blame it on \"defunding\" when they've been getting more money every year.
