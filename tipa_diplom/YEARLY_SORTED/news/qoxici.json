If someone was hurt, those there would help and take care of them. If someone was getting scared and wanted out, we'd help get them out. Everybody respected everyone for the most part. Maybe thats the difference between those who listen to rock/metal and those who listen to rap/hip-hop. One group cares and the other doesnt. Ive seen multiple times where the band will stop playing to make sure someone gets helped or has someone kicked out for being a dick, this stuff wouldnt fly with those of us there or the band playing. Imo the people there are equally at fault because absolutely no one seemed to care.",

This event is an extreme outlier.  \n\nThere would be paramedics and security helping people out at all of his shows for all the usual stuff - heat exhaustion, fights, drug overdoses, etc. I think it’s likely that TS had no idea kids were literally dying in the audience - he probably just thought it was the usual stuff listed above. \n\nPeople in these comments are acting like TS is an actual psychopath who wanted these kids to die and cared so little that he kept on performing. Maybe that’s true, but it seems unlikely. Travis Scott is commercial AF — and at the very least, he would know that kids dying at your shows is bad for business. He’s actually known for having a fairly squeaky clean record as he recognised very early in his career that controversies ≠ brand deals. \n\nPeople think the buck stops with Travis, but I think the company hired for event organisation should cop the most flak for this. They are the ones responsible for ensuring the security and safety of the audience and preventing things like crowd surges (which has been managed at all of his other shows without any deaths).",

            "text": "In my opinion, nothing that happened at this concert is new. Everything that I’ve read about this concert is basically the same thing that happens at all recent hiphop concerts. So let me break it down\n\n1. Crowds always break through the fence at EVERY hiphop concert nowadays. This is not the artist’s fault, it is usually the venue’s job to have enough staff to be able to control the crowd. To be honest, no matter how much security you have, this is always bound to happen if the artist is big enough\n\n2. People passing out at concerts is not new either. You can go on YouTube and look up all Michael Jackson’s concerts, there were always ambulance and medical staff at his concerts because young women were always passing out at the sight of MJ. Never did I see MJ stop performing because a fan passed out. So please stop attacking Travis Scott for performing while someone was getting medical help, he probably didn’t know what was going on and was doing his job. This is why concerts have medical staff on hand. It’s their job to handle any medical emergencies\n\n3. Crowd going nuts and ppl dying at concerts is nothing new. I can’t believe some ppl here are blaming Travis Scott as if he was supposed to stop the show and start giving CPR immediately. I’m sure this isn’t the first time someone has died at a concert and it isn’t gonna be the last. This happens more often that most ppl think. This is why people should be careful when they attend these concerts. It’s a crowd full of drunk, loud and drugged up kids… who tf do y’all think can control such a crowd? \n\n4. I honestly don’t think he should get the blame for what happened. However, in situations like these, we expect the face to take responsibility. So I’ll expect him to take responsibility for it, get sued and give some type of payout. As far as him being canceled, I don’t see a reason why he should be canceled. Security was supposed to control the crowd and medic was supposed to handle the emergencies. However, both failed that night and because of that, people are dead. It’s an unfortunate situation for everyone involved but we can’t just all pass blame to one person.",

In the suit, obtained by SPIN,  Manuel Souza filed a lawsuit against Scott himself, as well as organizer ScoreMore and concert behemoth Live Nation, claiming the deadly disaster was “predictable and preventable,” “a motivation for profit at the expense of concertgoers’ health and safety” and the “encouragement of violence.”\n\n\n\nA second suit was filed by 23-year-old Kristian Paredes on Sunday. The suit, which was obtained by the Daily Mail, names Travis Scott and Drake as defendants and are accused of negligence. It alleges that Drake “came on stage alongside Travis Scott and helped incite the crowd” and “the crowd became chaotic and a stampede began leaving eight dead and dozens including Kristian Paredes severely injured.”",

Then a minute passed, and he came out from under the smaller stage, having everyone then push and cause a crush in the opposite direction. Luckily nobody was hurt but my friends and I were sitting up high and thought somebody could’ve really gotten hurt or trampled there.

I know terrible things happened before the internet and social media got so big but i truly believe with social media how it is has caused borderline crazy idiots to go full blown simply for the likes and recognition.
