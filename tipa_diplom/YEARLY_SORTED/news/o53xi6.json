I was a Corrections Offficer in a prison when they lowered the cost of a phone call from around 4-5 dollars a call to somewhere under a dollar. \n\nWhat followed was brutal. Suddenly the resources available were not enough. The amount of phones and time slots were insufficient. The lack of resources were monopolized by the more violent inmates and gangs which chose who got on and when… and of course you had to pay. Eventually more phones were added and more means of contacting your family devised. You would hope that this would mean there was more to go around, but it just meant there was more to control and more assets to profit off of.\n\nWhenever officers attempted to take them back and give equal opportunity to get on, there were either removed from the unit or it became dangerous for them. The violence that followed was frequent and horrific. It routinely revolved around the phone usage. It persisted to the point that I left, and I’m sure is going on to this day. Any change in a highly structured environment like Prison always has consequences. Doing something like this will cause rouge wave size ripples throughout their DOC. Hopefully they thought it through, and are providing a way to transition the staff and inmates to system that will ensure everyone has access to their families… and I certainly hope that they do, the inmates deserve it. However, the environment lacks resources, and even if you make one resource available en masse, the population will still use it to make up for other things that they lack.",

These companies charge between $10-15 for inmates to receive a single phone call, and then offer a kickback to the jail in return. It’s almost hard to believe this is an industry, since it largely operates by extracting money from the families of prisoners, who are already among the poorest and most powerless people in America, in order to finance their own imprisonment.\n\n>There are three major competitors in this market, Global Tel*Link (GTL), Securus Technologies, and 3Cinteractive Corp. Both Securus and GTL are owned by private equity. Securus in fact is owned, once again, by billionaire Tom Gores’s Platinum Equity, which is trying to roll up the port-a-potty business (he also owns the Detroit Pistons and does a lot for charity). Right after buying Securus, Gores had the corporation try to buy 3Cinteractive, one of its remaining competitors, but regulators blocked the acquisition. No matter, all three major firms were recently sued for price-fixing, so even if they can’t merge, they allegedly do collude. I suspect there are roll-ups in jail services space, like payment cards and video-conferencing. \n\n\nhttps://mattstoller.substack.com/p/a-land-of-monopolists-from-portable",

They give you 15 calls and when the time is up the say you have one minute remaining and then once it’s up they just hang up. This is going to take off so much mental anguish from the prisoners who are in county jails and will be able to call their people to bond them out. They do give you one free 30 second call every week though!!! Securus is such a scam and it is so fucked up. When they said that “we’re on the right side of history here” they’re not lieing. I hope this is implemented across the country because being in prison is a lonely place and to have someone to talk to would be amazing. The feeling of even getting a letter make you feel like it’s Christmas Day and your a 8 year old kid. You will read more than a few times. This is so great for possible prison reform but I know one thing that’s gonna happen is there will be more fighting over phone time. You only get Rec 2 or 3 times a day with after dinner being the longest but in a dorm with 120+ prisoners and 6 phones to go around there is gonna be a lot of issues there.

Securus will still earn revenue for providing telecommunication services, which isn't surprising. The government doesn't provide phone service (not any more at least) and a private operator isn't going to come in and supply hardware and phone service for fun. \n\nPeople are asking what's been stopping the state from doing this sooner? Well, the reality is because covering phone calls is an expense, states have two choices: 1) fund the calls themselves out of the existing budget, or 2) push the cost onto the individual. In this case CT determined option 2 was best. To make matters worse, Connecticut signed agreements with Securus where it, the state, would earn a commission off every call made. This commission is an extra cost added on to each call for the benefit of the govt treasury, not the telecom provider. So why didn't it happen sooner? Because the state either didn't want to and/or there wasn't the political support to divert funds away from other projects in favor of prisoners. This type of commission model is becoming less common in the world of prison telephony, but unfortunately still exists in many places as the commissions provide important funding to many rural jurisdictions, many of which are in poor financial shape.\n\nSecurus isn't going away, however. They operate in several markets with govt covered phone calls already -- all that is changing is who is paying: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/statement-from-securus-technologies-re-legislation-requiring-taxpayer-funded-calls-in-connecticut-301315182.html",

If you take away family contact the inmates will build social groups that do not revolve around family thinking. The inmates new family will focus on what they know (this isn’t usually brain surgery or rocket science).  So going with what they know and who they are allowed to interact with fosters a criminal bond and acts as an apprenticeship program of sorts. We should be encouraging all of the contact that we can between inmates and their families for free. These inmates will mostly be released. I think everyone would rather see them struggling for their families rather than struggling to rob everyone else. \n\nFuck. I am rambling. If an inmate loses the connection or chance to connect with their family they have less to lose. Less to lose means better criminals and worse citizens. If you want to build citizens saddle the inmates with family ties. If you want criminals keep taking until the inmates have nothing to lose.",
