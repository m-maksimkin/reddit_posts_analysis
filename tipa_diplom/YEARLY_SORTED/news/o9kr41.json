No. Will it be an effective deterrent from this happening again? No. Just stop letting fans so close to the track and move on. \n\nThis is like Steve Bartman all over.

All the bikers with horrible injuries and very little left to show after years upon years of preparation. The people running the event wanting to take every last dollar you have. And as all the pain rushes her day by day realizing all of it is completely deserved. We all agree any honest human being should come forward about their wrongdoings at least eventually. But with this and probably other life traumas she could've been facing before all this, there's probably so fucking much going on in her head... Or the opposite could be true, possibly thinking too little about others that she's stroking a \"fuck that noise\" ego all the way home. I try not to judge individuals harshly until the second dumb thing happens. So maybe she'll eventually turn herself in willingly, or we'll see some stupid tweet she sends out to the public complaining that its not her fault and that everyone just hates her because she's a woman or some nonsense. \n\nWhat a story though, good lord.

She‚Äôd be better off turning herself in. \n\nWhile as a former racer and cycling fan I‚Äôd love to see her get some type of punishment so it would act as a deterrent to people doing this in the future, the reality there isn‚Äôt much to charge her with. It‚Äôs a public roadway, there weren‚Äôt barricades, she didn‚Äôt deliberately try to cause the crash, the tour has had numerous fan interference crashes in the past and they have encouraged crowds to pack the roadway in the past. \n\nThe problem has been getting worse. The advent of heavy & now live televised coverage has made it an event/destination so there are a lot of non-cycling fans that come for the spectacle. Kind of like how half the people who come to Wrigley Field these days aren‚Äôt Chicago Cubs fans or even baseball fans. Add in the selfie craze of the last decade & it‚Äôs exacerbated the problem ten fold. I think we‚Äôve reach the tipping point where the tour needs to seriously address the issue before somebody gets killed.",
