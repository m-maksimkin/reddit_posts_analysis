Because without any hard evidence or testimony against those people, they will never be brought down. They will all be able to use the argument that they couldn’t have known she/Epstein did these horrible things, and just knew them as a part of the rich and powerful, that they got invited to what they thought was just another private island, and that they had no knowledge of the horrors that went on there. Without any hard evidence (the kind blackmailers tend to keep), that argument will probably be enough in court. \n\nHowever, I do remember the feds did get ahold of a good amount of data from her, (and maybe Epstein as well?). I know that both of their M.O was allegedly blackmailing the rich and powerful (to the point where they themselves became the rich and powerful), so there very well could be a good chance that the feds do have a lot of evidence against a lot of important people, and are biding their time and building their case.

Isn’t that speculation? He said massage appointments were booked from a Rolodex of contacts by Maxwell, himself, assistant Sarah Kellen, or other staff for mornings, afternoons, and nights as late as 10:00 or 11:00. So Maxwell did book these appointments, but so did other employees? And with “Carolyn,” the employees would call her mother to book these appointments? \n\nThen there is Virginia Giuffre. An interview with The Cut mentioned her new chapter was interrupted five years after she said she escaped in 2002. In 2007, she was pulled into an FBI investigation that ultimately ended in a plea deal with little jail time. Why did she have to serve jail time? She mentions after Epstein passed, Judge Berman allowed the victims to come in and speak about what they had been through in impact statements. She says “I immediately became good friends with the other women; they’re my survivor sisters. We use WhatsApp at least a few times a week to keep in touch.” So between the time Epstein dies, and yesterday’s verdict, the victims have been speaking weekly? Then Giuffre’s name gets mentioned over 200 times during the trial? That’s probably not a coincidence.\n\nIt seems like there are still a lot of questions and I wonder what the evidence was that proved a guilty verdict beyond a reasonable doubt.",
