The New York and Manhattan District attorney's offices exist as little more than political tools to rubber stamp malfeasance. A few years from now, most of these prosecutors will land jobs as consultants or advisors to the firms the 'held accountable'. It's no accident GM, J&J, UBS, Wells Fargo keep doing things like this, their executives will never be held accountable, they'll continue to dust off their pride flag in June and keep on quietly lobbying to turn us all into slaves. These headlines trumpet 'justice' so you think we're progressing as a society, but those prosecutions typically fall into one of four categories: 'Rubber Stamp Crime' (involves corporations and fines), Bribes (involves individuals and very favorable plea deals, see Epstein's), Political Agenda, (see Giuliani) or Actual Justice (Rare).

I was in a car accident knocked out all my teeth and broke my back they put me on oxycodone and oxycontin and told I would have to be on them for the rest of my life, then got a new doctor my old one got Multiple sclosis and the new fixture was a physical assistant she told me I was too young to be on them and cut me off, that damn near killed me. Needless to say they say war on drugs but they'll are the ones that are making it like this.",

            "text": "I know people are upset about the so called \"opiate epidemic\", but it is only exponentially exacerbated by banning the right of people to get access to reasonable medicine.\n\nAt one point, yes, over-prescription of Opiates/Opioids was insanely out of control. At this point can basically get your foot cut off, and in certain states you'll be lucky to go home with 14 days in mid strength hydrocodone pills. \\*Edit for an idea how bad it can be, in my state,  Most if not all insurance providers will not cover more than 14 days of any Opiate/Opioids per 30 days, it actually may be the law here i'm not sure.\n\nThe \"war on drugs\" is a farce, and prohibition is the perfect example of that. I know one woman whose fiancee often has to carry to her to the shower in the morning so she can lay under the hot water for about 15 minute before her back will literally move so that she can attempt to get up.\n\nHer doctor knows this, and for years prescribed her reasonable amounts of real pain medication. Now his hands are apparently very tied due to some law called the \"100mg morphine equivalent\", so that no opiate/opioid can be prescribed in a higher than equivalent dose than that ( that's my understanding of it anyway). It's ok if you have burns chemical burns over 90% of your body, wouldn't want ya getting addicted to some substance would we! (while it wouldn't be uncommon for the Dr to go come and kill a liter of bourbon)..\n\nAddiction is a scourge, but so are things like literally just screaming and writing around in bed all day from some nasty disorder and literally having less, worse, than no life. But at least ya aren't addicted right!\n\nSociety is sick with how it continues to buy into the Nixon-era Drug lies (not to say that many drugs aren't still addictive and potentially dangerous, but we were lied to about recreational drugs so badly, like \"weed kills brain\" cells was not uncommon to hear just like 30 years ago. And much of this often totally untrue propaganda remains among anyone Gen X and over, meaning things like, people still to this day go to prison and literally get raped and killed for smoking weeds.....weeds. It's hard to change people and traditions that old.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLet me make clear that I am not defending opiate addiction or abuse, i'm merely saying that Fent has proven way worse. You can fit enough doses of it  to kill everysingle  American, in a single Storage Container, not only that, but its being used by the black market (which has inherent violence and dangers often), oh and its being used to adulterate drugs of different purity so its fairly easy to get dead by bag that was \"too good\" (because that way you could sell baggies of sand as heroin, put .00004$ in Fent in it, and people around the city will probably enjoy it.\n\nOh yeah and at bulk leve,  per dose its  unbelievably cheap, which only means we'll see way more of it. Good job defeating the \"opiate epidemic!\" by restricting legit users so a way more dangerous drug hit our streets....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOh and that girl I know who has a back problem that she saw a dr for? After that law changed, she was put on piss weak pills and her doctors hands were basically tied.\n\nHer pain got so bad after the laws changed and her doctors hands that she literally ended up turning to the street after over a year of just living in agony. Irony at its cruelest. I wonder how many legit pain patients just want a damn decent fix and the politicians and their lying control narratives and fear mongering got them out using heroin instead...\n\n(did some editing in here to try and make this long post more reader friendly and add a couple things i forgot)",
