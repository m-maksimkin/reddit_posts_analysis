The best part of framing how holy and awesome you are compared to others using unconscious flesh is the unconscious flesh can‚Äôt have an opinion about how stupid you are. The moment a child is born the GOP abandons it because children can speak and their parents can attest to the disgusting treatment and hypocrisy of the right wing. I‚Äôm tact republicans actively hurt vulnerable children in our country all the time, but since they view themselves as hero‚Äôs they can ignore the parts that make them feel bad. It‚Äôs a great mental gymnastics exercise.",

God clearly starts the process of making a human in the womb. The methods available today to stop Gods delicate, personal involvement in the creating of a human being is dangerous territory to step in. Of course to the people who don‚Äôt believe in God this means nothing for 2 Corinthians 3:14 tells us, \n\n‚ÄúBut the people‚Äôs minds were hardened, and to this day whenever the old covenant is being read, the same veil covers their minds so they cannot understand the truth. And this veil can be removed only by believing in Christ.‚Äù \n\nIf you made it this far I pray through the Holy Spirit in Jesus name that your eyes would be opened and the faith to believe in the Gospel about Jesus and all of Gods word would be granted to you, and the veil would be lifted from your eyes. Amen. \n\nI will be vulnerable with you all and say if I was delivered the news that the fetus in my wife‚Äôs womb will kill her if shes allowed to come to full term, I might consider abortion. But that‚Äôs a sin I would have to carry before the judgement seat of Christ and I pray none of you have to face that decision. I also believe that God can work miracles and perhaps abortion wouldn‚Äôt even be necessary because I believe He can reverse and heal anything.\n\nOn a side note: this woman‚Äôs actions were very bizarre for stealing fetuses for some kind of gotcha and I don‚Äôt condone it",
