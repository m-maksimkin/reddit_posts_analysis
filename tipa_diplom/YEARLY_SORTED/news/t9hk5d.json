And that's why every time you stand in front of a lawmaker, you're ill-equipped to make a valid argument. Simply yelling raise minimum wage isn't going to accomplish shit. All that happens is everything keeps going up. You need to argue for living cost standards. For example, if most retail people in a city make $1200/month take home pay, then the MOST you can afford in rent is $375/month. Half of all essential spending should only be 50% of your pay. The other half is divided 20%/30% for savings & retirement/flex spending (everything else). I tell my boss at work that all I can afford is XXX amount in rent based on his pay. If they raise my rent any further, I'll have to quit and find somewhere else where rent is more affordable. I tell my landlord the same thing. Let everyone know that you have costs standards and why. I make this. This is why 25% of take home pay is the most we should pay. Either raise my pay or lower my rent because, if you don't, then at least the company knows why it can't find workers or landlord can't find tenants.\r  \n\r  \nAnd when I say 50% should cover living expenses, I mean ALL essentials. Rent/mortgage, all utilities required to rent (electric, water, garbage, etc.) food, all medical care, transportation to and from work. This isn't an opinion. Google it. Paying over half your wages in rent isn't fucking sustainable! Medical costs that take up too much of your living costs isn't fucking sustainable! If you pay a lot for medical, someone needs to help with rent/utilities, food, transportation to and from work, etc. to keep it at 50%. Because how the hell are you going to put together an emergency savings? How the hell are you going to put money into the economy for things like seeing a movie or going out to eat to the rest of us get a paycheck? This isn't rocket science people. It's basic common sense.\r  \n\r  \nI think the reason many of you aren't doing this is because it's the equivalent of a fat person looking at a photo/video of themselves nude. Looking at how poor you really are is going to be HARD. Proper budgeting will show that most of you can't really afford a car. That you need 3 or4 of you crammed into a 2 bedroom small apartment. That you can't afford an iPhone. And that you DEFINITLY can't afford a wife and kid (sorry, many of you are dying alone). Every time you go into a store, you'll be surrounded by the word \"NO, you're too poor to afford me. Just get the Equate brand soap and walk your poor ass out the door\".\r  \n\r  \nOtherwise, America will be literally covered in homeless tents while guys like Jeff Bezos can afford to build rockets and his own private army (trust me, it's coming). Get your shit together America before it's too late. Trust me, you don't want to be homeless. Your life expectancy drops like a rock.\n\nOr, you know, don't and suffer. Keep downvoting comments like this and wonder why everything keeps getting worse like the de-evolved species you appear to becoming. Because while I feel bad for you, I don't feel *that* bad.

For instance, having car in Mexico is considered a life goal, a success in life, even if it's some cheap economy car, why? because it's hard to buy a car earning so little. Is just that it's the first time that most of the American people face these kind of issues.\n\nHowever I acknowledge important differences, like, here in the US, having a car is a necessity, because people work at downtown but live in the suburbs, there is little to no public transportation. There are places where literally the only way to get somewhere is with a car. That's a difference, in Mexico the public transportation is not great but it's available everywhere.\n\nAnother difference is that Mexico has free healthcare and you don't need an insurance to go directly to some random medic for consultation, and it's cheap. I mean, interesting differences but is not the end of the world, people have been living even worse for decades, is just like nobody cares, unless it happens to you right? \n\nAgain, I sympathize with people struggling, just a different perspective. I am going to be downvoted to hell.",

They were even contemplating purchasing a motor home for summer travel, but you know, \"gas is too expensive right now--thanks Biden\". That motherfucker called me today and asked me to help him cover his boat payment. Because of \"inflation\". \n\nI make half of what he makes. I still save money, live in a generally expensive metro area, even after inflation. My friend is now living \"paycheck to paycheck\". To reduce my costs I started going with off-brand cereals, reduced my meat intake, sold my gas hog of a truck, and replaced it with a fuel-sipping Subaru. I even did some insurance shopping for my vehicles and house. Also switched cell phone companies to reduce those costs. After inflation and a $1200 a month home payment, I'm still saving about 20k a year.    \n\n\nInflation is bad, don't get me wrong, but I wonder how many of those \"64%\" are dipshits like my friend that consume way more than they should?

It has an everyday meaning of course, but you'd think in a formal report they'd specify a precise meaning, because everyday phrases mean different things to different people. \n\nGiven the lack of definition, and the frequent use of \"people *reported* living paycheck-to-paycheck\" language, it looks like this is basically a survey asking people if they're living \"paycheck-to-paycheck\" without defining what it means - which again, isn't that useful, because different people will understand that phrase differently. \n\nFor example, 36.5% of people earning more than $100k per year reported \"living paycheck-to-paycheck\", but were \"comfortable\" and had no \"issues paying their bills\". \n\nSo... what does \"living paycheck to paycheck\" actually mean if you make more than $100k, are comfortable, and have no issues paying your bills? Does it literally just mean you rely on your next paycheck to be able to make your rent or mortgage payment? What if you have $50k in savings, but still rely on your paychecks to make rent because you don't want to deplete those savings? Are you still living paycheck-to-paycheck?\n\nI find it hard to find any meaning in this report given the lack of firm definitions.",

I had to go into a dealership (wouldn‚Äôt do it over the phone) with severe bruising, swelling and pain. Everything is marked up $5k to start, there‚Äôs nothing to test drive, no warranties included. Lots of scare tactics used. I ended up doing my best under the guidance of a friend whose husband works at a dealership. Still paid over what the car is worth.

The middle-class was non-existent by the mid to late 90's, and by the 2000's it was practically gone. Poverty took over with around 10% being ultra-rich/wealthy. Then it all came crashing down as more people, disillusioned by the way things were heading with capitalism, chose to vote for the complete opposite and now that's where we are... This is happening here in the US. More greed leads to more poverty, and eventually there will be little middle-class/working class left and more people living in poverty. \nI don't think any extreme ideology is the answer, but in the US our system is broken and heavily favoring the capitalistic side. We need a healthy balance of both, but unfortunately as shitty humans we only learn when it's too late. All I say is brace yourselves and use Venezuela as an example.

Yeah, then your job is essential.  But for almost everyone else, your job can go away tomorrow.  And if you think your job is in one of those essential categories I mentioned, perhaps you're incorrect.\n\nI left Detroit for Chicago in something like 1974.  Inflation was 26%.  Mortgages?  Don't ask.  Gas prices had tripled, but big deal; they were rationed anyway.  Unemployment in Detroit was about the same as inflation, and there were guys selling apples on streetcorners.  Our President, a Republican, had frozen prices and wages in an attempt to manage the economy centrally and had threatened to take over US Steel.  He was in favor of national health insurance, too, and had declared a national speed limit of 55 mph.  I SWEAR ALL THIS HAPPENED.  I was there.  I saw it.\n\nYou want to say how bad things are?  \\*Laughter\\*.  See, back then Social Security meant diddly and wasn't indexed to inflation.  Grannies living on social security ate dinners of cat food on crackers.  People actually starved to death.  Ah, but of course taxes were too high on the wealthy people.  They needed a break.\n\nThe FACT is that the top 0.01% of the wage earners in the USA have taken almost all of the productivity gains since 1967 for themselves.  The people actually responsible for those gains have gotten almost none of them.  Income disparity now is worse than it was in the time of the robber barons.  Guys like Trump aren't the solution.
