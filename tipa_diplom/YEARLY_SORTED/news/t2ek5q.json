Please someone have this sort of same thought process that I have rn. \n\nIsn't it mind boggling to see this level of togetherness between support for Ukraine and all these celebs/ countries/ people of power? I don't think I've seen anything like this before. It's heart warming yet makes you really think about how bad the situation actually is. \n\nRussia pulled a nazi Germany on Poland play straight from the book and basically everyone with a brain or something to lose is now against putin and his regime. Germany originally didn't want to help and now they're literally supplying thousands of anti tank equipment and more to start. You have old Russian allies turning on them, the Chinese don't wanna say anything to back putin anymore. \n\nYou have people from other countries leaving their own to fight in Ukraine. It shows just how dangerous this conflict is. And how it has war crimes written all of it since day 1. \n\nThe other shocking thing for me is just how bent Putin had showed he is. He's currently in a losing to stalemate position with Ukraine, has completely fucked his economy and war machine for decades to come in the span of 5 days, and had the audacity to claim this \"special operation\" was because Ukraine is \"nazi\" infested.\n\nThat is literally Hitler. They tried to blitzkrieg Ukraine and have failed with numerous reports of their soldiers lacking supplies, motivation, no clear objectives given, and many soldiers dead from only a few days in conflict. \n\nPutin clearly did not think Ukraine would put up this kind of fight nor did he believe countries would go at him like this, he was shocked to hear how the US was talking about his plans to the public word for word. \n\nHe has failed as a leader, failed as a general, his own inner core is publicly disagreeing with him, and is a coward for what he has attempted to do. To a country that is considered to be your brothers. He is no \"tactician\". He is a con man who I hope will somehow be brought down permanently.",
