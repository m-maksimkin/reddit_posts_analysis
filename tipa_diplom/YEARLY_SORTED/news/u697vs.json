            "text": "Hi, I work as a bankruptcy trustee. Here's how I expect this to play out:\n\nIn Chapter 11 bankruptcies, the debtors themselves act as their own trustees, known as a \"Debtor in Possession\" (DIP), at least initially. As the DIP, the debtor has a fiduciary duty to operate the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of the interested parties (creditors and ownership) and make certain disclosures of financial data. In most Chapter 11s, this is what happens, and an outside trustee does not have to be brought in. \n\nThat is **not** what I expect to happen in this case. There is already deep distrust between Jones and at least one significant group of his creditors, the judgement creditors (the lawsuit plaintiffs). Those creditors will be clamoring for the appointment of an outside trustee. They'll file a section 1104 motion to appoint a trustee at the first opportunity, and Alex Jones is certain to give them such an opportunity. He has already demonstrated a reticence to disclose critical information and a tendency to ignore court orders. It won't be long before he'll have to be compelled to do or disclose something he doesn't want to, and the court will lose patience with him and appoint a trustee. \n\nAnd that is where the fun begins. The trustee will have access to all company records and financial information, and will have control over the company. The really fun part is that in corporate cases trustees not only have access to privileged communications with professionals such as lawyers and accountants, but also ***we can waive that privilege on the company's behalf and make those communications public if we so choose.*** This of course applies to privileged communications *of the company* and **not** the communications of individual officers in their individual capacities with their own personal lawyers or accountants. Often the same firms serve both the company and the individual officers, muddying the issue of who controls the confidentiality of a given phone call or email and who has the right to access the record. Expect to see lots of fights about this. \n\nThe trustee will be looking for, among other things, money owed to the company, evidence of any outgoing transfers of money or property within the last few years, with particular emphasis on transfers to or on behalf of company insiders, payments of debts or expenses not actually owed by the company itself (such as any personal expenses of Jones), and any potential lawsuits the company could file against anyone, including but not limited to company officers or other insiders.\n\nIf Alex Jones had a problem with being questioned about his finances in a post-judgement deposition, he is going to ***love*** having a bankruptcy trustee digging through his companies' financial records. If you have anything to hide, bankruptcy court is a terribly stupid place to be. If he doesn't end up filing a personal bankruptcy petition himself, we might eventually see his creditors file an involuntary petition against him. Those are rare and not easy to pull off, but if a trustee gets appointed in the Chapter 11 cases and discovers any potential claims against him individually, it becomes all the more likely.",
