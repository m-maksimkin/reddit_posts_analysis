He's calling for them to arrest him for war crimes.\n\nArresting someone is much harder. Even if you could walk up to Putin and wrestle with him to get some handcuffs on him, you can't take custody of him alone. You'll need several people cooperating to essentially kidnap him from his own personal security. With that in mind, even with the state of the Ruble, 1 million USD is not enough.\n\nBut that also means that you might be able to crowd fund a bonus. Sure, gofundme won't let you use their platform to crowdfund an assassination, but they might let you crowdfund an arrest so long as there is no call to violence (I dunno, go check their TOS).\n\n(yes, I know the silly picture he attached to his tweet says \"Wanted: Dead or Alive\", but that is literally just a silly picture)",

There were no explosives in the basement, *just bags of flour... (that field-tested positive for military grade explosive)*\n\nThere's so much evidence tying Putin to the attack, you can drive straight line to him from the FSB agents that planted it, but in Russia it's forbidden to discuss and the people who lived in the apartment building refuse to talk about it in fear that \"they might actually blow us up next time.\"",

When the US fire team finally found Saddam and arrested him unharmed, they were just doing their contractual duty in military service, so they were not eligible for the reward money.\n\n(Similar to how a firefighting team coming to your house is already contractually bound to fight the fire in your house, so any offer of money you make to them is revocable at your will.)",

I imagine he has pretty good protection anyways, so $1 million may not even be a good enough price tag, but how would/should other world leaders treat Putin’s willingness to use assassination as a tool? Would the removal of Putin even change anything about the situation or would it even lead to an escalation (nukes and/or more reprisal assassinations)?

You need to remember that Putin is KGB and not at all stupid.\n\nIf you knew Putin was somewhere in the Kremlin, perhaps the army could surround the place with tanks and so on and demand that Putin be turned over, and then starve the place out and shut off almost all the power until Putin appeared.
