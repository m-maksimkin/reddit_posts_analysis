We have had many conversations with the doctors, who confirmed that his heart COULD swell and go into severe crisis but they can’t guarantee anything and it’s a choice we will have to make if he wants to be listed.”\n\n\nI get it. That’s scary. And we should push through all the vitriol and remember that this is a father fighting for his life. But...There are no easy choices in complex medical cases. Much of the time, patients have to choose between two equally scary and risky options. Nothing is simple with end stage heart failure. Every choice will be second guessed and feel like a catch-22. But the hospital has their policy and that policy makes sense. Life is about choices. He could risk a rare side effect by getting the vaccine, or he could not get vaccinated and risk getting covid which most likely will kill him. One choice puts him on the transplant list and the other choice doesn’t. And it looks like he made his choice. If he doesn’t want to get vaccinated, that is absolutely his choice. But he can’t make a decision and then insist that an exception be made for him because he doesn’t like the consequences of his decision. It sucks that he needs a heart transplant during the era of covid and all the risks that covid entails, but that’s the situation. There’s no arguing here. The hospital has a policy and no amount of begging will change that. He cannot get a transplant unless he is vaccinated. Plenty of other people in similar situations to him are taking the risk of getting vaccinated for the life saving gift of a transplant.",

I hate *him* so so so much. \n\nMy Dad didn’t have this kind of chance. My Dad suffered through chemo- I watched him wither away for over a year, too sick to eat, and become a thin, tired shell of who he once was. I remember our last Christmas, when he taught me to tie my new lace-up shoes and helped me set up the little robot dog and mini dollhouse I got that year, when I realized he was most likely not going to survive, and then nothing for 8 months until he died because I blocked it out. *I remember quite a bit between age 3 and age 8, but not a single thing from late December 2001 to early August 2002*. He fought so hard, up until the end. The cancer wasn’t his fault. \n\nMy Dad didn’t have this chance, but if he did, he would’ve taken it. I’d bet my life on that. My Dad loved us more than anything. Photo albums from when I was an infant show him holding me up to people like I was Simba. I remember him telling me once, he wished he were able to have more time with us. Wished he didn’t have to work as much as he did. He’d have given anything for one more day, just as I would. \n\nI hate this scumbag who is choosing to die and rot in the ground. I hate this bastard who clearly loves his children but is choosing to gift upon them the *absolute fucking lifelong agony* a child suffers when a parent dies. I hate this piece of garbage who is choosing to let his children wonder, awake in the middle of the night, for the rest of their lives, “would my Dad have been proud of me here? Would my Dad have loved me still? Would my Dad have given this advice?” or imagined he was there, for every occasion, hoped and prayed that it was all some sort of bad dream. Lost in a fantasy of *what if Daddy were still alive?* in moments they know they should be living in the present. \n\nI can say with such certainty that my Dad would never have chosen this for us. But to not even have *that* tiny little sliver of comfort… **I hate that man for denying his children that sliver of comfort they deserve, for denying them the knowledge that Daddy did everything and fought his ass off to stay, and he just couldn’t.** Because he *isn’t* doing everything. \n\nI hate that this scuff of dirt is choosing to let his children ask themselves, years from now, again and again, awake and alone, “Was it worth it? Did he not love me as much as I thought? So many people received the vaccine, and were fine. He must have known that. Were his politics more important than me? Did he really believe this? How could he have believed this? Why didn’t someone stop him? Was he just looking for an excuse to die instead? I don’t understand. I don’t understand. He’ll never walk me down the isle, he’ll never meet my children, he’ll never be there for me when I need him, not when I learn to drive or when I discover his music and movie/TV/comic interests, not when I’m choosing a career, not when my Mom doesn’t get me because I take after my Dad, or because I’m exactly like her and she doesn’t have compassion for it. *I need my Dad.*”",

You’re going to let your political point of view interfere with extending your life? No one can intrude on your “personal freedoms” if you’re dead and buried - and that’s what’s going to happen if you don’t get the transplant.  I just cannot believe the extent that some antivaxers will go to, just to prove a point.  And in this case, what, exactly, is the point?  I worked 20 years in the OR of a level 1 trauma center before I retired.  If you don’t follow the guidelines, you don’t get the kidney, liver, heart, or pancreas.  The waiting lists far exceed the available organs, so why waste a perfectly healthy, normal functioning organ on someone who will continue drinking, taking recreational drugs, smoking, or eating excessively? This person will only trash the new organ they get and end up back at ground zero.  It makes more sense to give this organ to someone who will really appreciate the gift and treat it with respect.  This is not the donor family’s expectation - to be giving the organ from a loved one so you can continue drinking alcohol for several more years. Nor is it their expectation to give you an organ and then have you die from Covid.\n\nOrgan transplants reek havoc  on your system. You have to take anti-rejection drugs for life.  Your immune system is compromised, so if you contract Covid after an organ transplant, your chances of survival plummet.  And that’s wasting an organ.  \nThe hospital is well within their rights to impose any conditions they wish to preserve the success of organ donation/transplant.",

Same reason why doctors don’t consider alcoholics as candidates for liver transplants unless they’ve been sober for X amount of time.",

So when we determine who gets one, we have to make sure it's fair.\n\nThe way we define \"fairness,\" here, is based primarily on a person's likelihood of survival, compared to the likelihood of survival of other people who also need a heart transplant. \n\nI think that's basically a good way to define \"fairness\" in a case like this. (I think being completely random would be less fair. And anything else would be way WAY less fair.)\n\nGetting major surgery - pretty much *the most major surgery ever* - leaves you at *wildly* increased risk of not surviving COVID. This risk affects all potential heart-transplant-seekers equally. And it's a big risk because COVID is fucking everywhere.\n\nIf this person was resistant to COVID, his risk of survival would be *much* higher. If this person was resistant to COVID, it would be more fair for him to be given a heart transplant *that could instead go to someone else.*\n\nThere is a way he could *drastically* increase his resistance. And, even better, it's a way that is free, and easy, and whose entire downside is 'maybe a few days of feeling kinda shitty'. \n\nI'd strongly suggest he does that. This will dramatically increase the fairness of giving him a transplant that could instead go to someone else. It will also dramatically increase his likelihood of surviving COVID regardless - and even if he'd survive anyway, it will *wildly* decrease the shittiness of *getting* COVID, which is shitty when you're resistant but way way shittier when you're not.\n\nIf he does not do this thing to increase his resistance to COVID, I think it's totally fair that the hospital continue to prioritize their incredibly scarce resources to those with higher likelihoods of survival. That's fair to them, fair to him, and fair to all people in general. Including me, who's got exactly as much skin in this game as everyone else. To do anything else would be unfair to everyone - including me.\n\nMy sympathies go out to those people whose lower chances of survival are based on circumstances that are outside of their control.

My husband is a Kidney transplant scheduler, and his transplant team keeps tabs on all transplant recipients for life. He receives weekly notifications about deaths of recipients of the past, and they have been noticing that a large percentage of those deaths recently were from COVID in unvaccinated individuals. I have a colleague who had a kidney transplant done years ago, and he got vaccinated (obviously post-transplant since COVID didn't exist back when he got his) and unfortunately because of his meds, his antibodies show that he doesn't have an adequate defense should he get COVID. The safest thing to do for transplant recipients regarding COVID is to get the vaccine beforehand, build up some immunity, and then get the transplant. Maybe the vaccine isn't as perfect as people think, but surely it's better than nothing especially in this situation? People wait *years* to receive a transplant unless they have their own donor lined up. My husband loves his job since he gets to call people who have been waiting years and give them the good news that they can FINALLY schedule their surgery. It's such a long, tedious process for everyone involved. It only makes sense that there are strict requirements entailing who receives the organs seeing how the supply is so low and the demand is so high. The man in the story has a right to choose not to be vaccinated, but if it makes him ineligible for treatment, then unfortunately that's the fate he has chosen. :(",
