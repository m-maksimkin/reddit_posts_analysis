To be hopped up on a nationalistic fervor directed by feelings of revenge about attacks on our people. To be led into attacking an innocent nation who had not harmed us. To be told we were \"liberating\" it and that the people would welcome us. To be denounced by countries of the world for our naked aggression. To realize, slowly, after many years of brutal atrocities, death, destruction, that what we had done was a crime. Worse, a crime that was a festering wound which hurt us too, which wasted our people, our treasure, on the pointless ambitions of powerful government officials. \n\nIt took us years to wake up to it. I hope Russians can do better.",

He was completely right, but that pissed off millions of home owners. \n\nHe also called out the legislature for too many Christmas tree budget Bill's and failing to pass legislation on time.\n\nUnfortunately, he also identified a couple unions which were bad and hurting the state overall. Note: ALL unions are different...some are actually bad and cover up/protect criminal and unethical behavior (eg/ some police unions in certain areas). Anyway, he went after 2 bad unions and they launched a major smear campaign against him. His popularity plummeted after that.\n\ntldr; it was sobering to actually see an effective, outside politician come in and address cold-hard truths that we didn't want hear.
