Then people started panic homebuying to get out of cramped apartments, move away from large cities into suburbs, whatever. The problem was, inventory was low. In our area we had 20 or 30 offers on every single property, within hours of it hitting the market. This caused MASSIVE bidding wars, with people over paying on their homes to the tune of 50, sometimes 100k, and thats in the entry level bracket alot of times. Now, banks and appraisers were reluctant to call those the new values of the homes, because if they gave loans for that, and demand died or lowered too much when the panic ended, if they had to resale the house the bank would lose a mind blowing amount of money. Now fast forward a year, its 2021, and prices are still increasing and demand is not slowing, so appraisers are more able to accurately judge the homes. I am fsirly positive that if this woman got a fourth appraisal, and did it herself, it would be very similar to the third. This is a timing issue, not a racial one.

Wouldn’t that alone account for the differences in home quotes? The first appraisal was done at the beginning of the year and the third appraisal was done after the market went crazy and prices went through the roof. \n\nShe didn’t use the same company for the third appraisal either. So we don’t know, with the details presented, anything about the third appraisal. \n\nIs this racist or is this poor timing in the market? I’m genuinely curious from people in the real estate market if this appraisal difference is something that would be expected as the housing market heated up over 2020 and into 2021. \n\nI’m trying to get my ducks in a line to buy a home and I’ve just seen the prices go through the roof.

I can't count the number of times where I reached out to see apartments only for the apartment to suddenly be off the market that same day or the next, and for myself to be shown shittier apartments for about the same amount, or more, per month. When my (white) spouse and I moved in together and when my spouse was the one to reach out and meet with brokers, suddenly every apartment we tried to view was still available and if it wasn't they got shown something equally nice. Even when we both separately try to book a viewing of the same apartment. To the point where my spouse is now the first person to view every apartment we want to look at because it's now clear to both of us that they're going to be shown better apartments in better areas than I would be shown.

            "text": "This is regurgitated bullshit story again.\n\nhttps://news.yahoo.com/home-appraisal-black-couple-skyrockets-160543526.html\n\nhttps://thehill.com/policy/finance/housing/513770-florida-couple-says-home-was-appraised-for-40-percent-higher-after\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/black-homeowners-have-their-houses-appraised-for-less.html\n\nBut let’s tackle the OPs.\n\nFirst an appraisal is an opinion. You call 5 different appraisers you’ll get 5 different prices. \nAn appraiser gets nothing but a flat rate. So it doesn’t matter if they say your house is 2 million or 20k. They get nothing from it. You could claim the bank hires them to low ball, however you can always get your own appraiser if you don’t like what they say so that’s out.\n\n* First she says in March 2020 her house appraised at 125k. March is when Covid hit the fan. \n\n* May 2020 her house appraised at 110k and she’s wondering how she loss 15k. [Unemployment Rate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/08/april-2020-jobs-report/) was 14.7 in April 2020. Meaning no one has money to buy houses meaning demand falls meaning price falls. \n\n* October 2020 she gets a brilliant idea to pretend to be white. Suddenly 259k. There was a stimulus check, people were getting paid 600 extra on top of what of unemployment. People were working from home, meaning they didn’t have to live in the city and could move further out. Pushing prices up. \n\n[Housing Price Chart](https://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/indicators/House-Price-Index.png)\n\nIf you look at the chart beginning 2020 houses were flat even going down slightly. But then a sudden spike upward.\n\n[Unemployment Rate](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2020/mobile/unemployment-rate-falls-to-6-point-9-percent-in-october-2020.htm)\n\nUnemployment rate for October 2020 was 6.9%\n\nSo May it was 13.3% October 2020 it was 6.9% half of what it was. \n\n[Housing Supply Per Month](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MSACSR)\n\nApril 2020 it was 6.8.\nOctober it was 3.5 once again half. \n\nhttps://ycharts.com/indicators/monthly_supply_of_homes_in_the_united_states\n\nIf you look at the supply it appears to be an average of high 5s low 6s going back to 2017.\n\n3.5 is abnormally low. Meaning prices are going to be higher. \n\n[Indianapolis House Price Average](https://www.redfin.com/city/9170/IN/Indianapolis/housing-market)\n\nIn Jan 2020 it was average 154k and then in October average 184k. \n\nhttps://www.fool.com/the-ascent/research/average-house-price-state/\n\n“Existing home sales fell 17.8% in April and 9.7% in May, then climbed by 20.7% in June 2020.”\n\n“Housing inventory is historically low -- in June 2020, there were 18.2% fewer homes available for purchase than in 2019.”\n\nAnd once again 3 different appraisers in 3 different times and she’s wondering why she got 3 different prices. She’s wondering how it appraised for over twice as much when everyone was working from home, people were making more money not working, couldn’t spend the money on vacations, housing availability crashed.\n\nMust be racism though.\n\nEDIT: Also when you stage your house, you remove personal stuff because people want to walk in and imagine themselves in living in the house. Kinda hard to do when you have people’s family pictures and belongings around. \n\nAlso a staged house will get you a higher price than a non staged house. \n\n[Staged Houses fetch 1-5% more according to realtors. ](https://www.trulia.com/guides/staging-a-house/)",

What's reliable is what you can actually sell it for. If \"homes owned by black people are worth half as much\" were actually a thing, any white person could make 100% profit by buying any home owned by a black person and then selling it to a white person. This would create a Donchian Channel where the amount the black-to-white buyer is willing to pay would increase until it's almost the same as what they'd get from the white-to-white buyer. Because a black-to-white buyer willing to pay $100 and make a $100 profit would get outbid by a black-to-white-buyer willing to pay $105 and make a $95 profit and so on. Say what you will about capitalism, but one hard and fast rule is profits have no provenance. So we can have the discussion \"Do appraisers give black owned homes 50% lower appraisals than identical white owned homes?\" but if ANYONE thinks \"Society/The Marketplace value black owned homes at 50% of white owned homes.\" then by all means, go buy a black owned home for 90-95% of its market value (thereby helping them reclaim most of that) and then immediately flip it for a comfortable 5% profit for your troubles.\n\n2: Also, and I know this doesn't justify the racism if that's what occurred here, but when I owned a home (before I decided fuck that noise) I would have paid good money to have someone appraise it at 50% of what it was worth. The implication for my tax bill would be astronomical. Well worth not being able to borrow against the equity.\n\nhttps://smartasset.com/taxes/indiana-property-tax-calculator#IZO6AGDA0Y\n\nAssuming she's in Marion county, a 50% lower appraisal would be saving her about $1.5k/year in taxes. That's a 100% savings that hits the bottom line.\n\n3: She is comparing what she bought it for with hard cash and negotiations to data-based estimates. That is not comparing apples to apples. It is entirely possible she overpaid, there was a spike in the local market at the time, etc.\n\n4: When she talked to her mortgage provider they said \"Okay, find a house like yours nearby that sold for $160-180k.\" She didn't do that. She got another estimate based on market analysis. If you say your house is worth $160-180k asking you to find a similar home in the area that sold for that amount recently is not an unreasonable request. If what you're saying is true, you should be able to do that.\n\n5: Two appraisers who didn't know each other and didn't talk to each other valued her home at around the same amount. A third one comes in with double that and it's the first two that were clustered together that we doubt?\n\n>For months, she suspected she had been low-balled on two home appraisals because she's Black. She decided to put that suspicion to the test and asked a white family friend to stand in for her during an appraisal.\n\nOh, and she didn't get the third appraisal at the same time as the other two. A lot can change in months, though probably not enough to explain such a large disparity.\n\n6: The value of her house hasn't changed, ever, not once because of an appraisal. The value of her home is recorded when it is bought/sold. If she is right and the value of her home is $180k+ she could get a real estate agent to sell it and that real estate agent would have a financial incentive to get the maximum amount they could for her*.\n\n*Within reason. Real estate agents don't want to have a market on the house for ages. The home owner might be willing to wait another 2 months to get another 5k. The Real estate agent might not be.\n\n7: There HAS been research done on appraisals of black owned homes vs. white owned homes, but they are very different from this. They generally show that:\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/business/black-homeowners-have-their-houses-appraised-for-less.html\n\n>a home in a majority Black neighborhood is likely to be valued for 23 percent less than a near-identical home in a majority-white neighborhood\n\nThat is not the same as \"An identical home owned by a white person is valued higher.\" The homes are in totally different neighborhoods and the studies didn't isolate for:\n\n-Income level\n\n-Educational attainment\n\nGenerally, when you isolate for those things all racial disparities disappear. I.E. once you isolate for income level and educational attainment, black neighborhoods are JUST as nice and safe as white neighborhoods. It's a useful data point for debunking race realist talking points, but it's also useful for debunking the idea that the housing market discriminates vis a vis equity.\n\n8: Get ready for the big one, guys. If identical homes in black neighborhoods... are worth less than identical homes in white neighborhoods... that is *good* for black people. For the following reasons:\n\nA: As addressed, they *pay less in property taxes* for the *same house*! It functions as a subsidy! That's GOOD for them!\n\nB: It means they can get homes and rent apartments for cheaper. Fundamentally \"The same house in a black neighborhood is worth 27% less\" ALSO means \"You can get the same house in a black neighborhood 27% sooner/cheaper.\" You can't believe one thing without believing the other. If the house is worth 27% less than a white neighborhood equivalent for the seller, that's ALSO true for the buyer. Every transaction has a buyer and a seller by definition.\n\nC: Their equity does NOT grow at a slower rate. The Brookings study has shown that the gap has been more or less unchanged for decades; indeed they belaboured this point. That means the rate at which equity is growing is still the same. That means if a white person and a black person have $100k and they both buy \"$100k worth\" of \"house\" in their respective neighborhoods, their $100k will appreciate at the same rate. Saying that this hurts the ability of black home owners to build equity would mean the gap would have to be GROWING and it is not.",

The first appraiser used comps that didn’t even come close to comparing to their house, including foreclosures which aren’t even supposed to be used unless absolutely nothing else is available. There are shitty appraisers and good appraisers just like anything else and despite the fact that they’re supposed to be following a specific set of standards, they’re still subjective. When you have a contract that buyer’s bank sends an appraiser. Say that one doesn’t close and you get another buyer. That buyer’s bank sends another appraiser. Odds are the house will appraise differently each time. The contract price should carry a lot of weight.

Home prices are inflated like crazy because there is not enough supply to meet demand; it's been this way for the past few years. The price of lumber may play a small role (especially in flips), but it's mostly lack of supply\n\n2. I've lived here for three years, and one of the things that are most surprising to me is the fact that a 100k house can be a block away from a 300k house. I was interested in living on the north side, and you could steadily see that line move down every few months. \n\n3. I (a white man) have no trust for appraisers here. I live in what some people would consider a \"transitioning\" neighborhood (let's be real, it has already transitioned), but that historical bias is still there in central Indiana.

Legitimately does not work like that at all and articles like this don't give nearly enough information. The values in most markets have shot up significantly inside of the last 6 months and even more so over the last 3 months due to incredibly low inventory and historically low interest rates. The first two appraisals were completed BEFORE the recent upswing in values. I have no frame of reference on the Indianapolis market, but I imagine it has been impacted similar to most others right now. In some areas we have seen a near 20% increase in sales price over 6 months. Appraisers work within the confine of the market they are appraising (time and place). In dense urban areas if you're going outside of a half mile, you must explain why. In dense suburban areas you need to add commentary for sales outside of 1 mile and why they were used. We typically compare apples to apples...you have a 2 story, 4 bedroom, 2.1 bathroom Colonial in a standard suburban tract development? Great, then that's what I will be trying to utilize to value your home. I have a feeling that this last appraisal uses \"comps\" from all over the place to come in at this most likely unsupported value. We legally cannot even comment on the racial make up of a neighborhood. And you know why? Because it doesn't matter. What matters is the price that people are paying for similar homes in that same neighborhood and that's all. Could there be a racist appraiser out there?

My two thoughts on the matter-\n\nThis time last year, the housing market was appreciating.  Right now?  Certain areas people are offering $30k-40k above asking, sight unseen.  8-10 months in a housing market can be a significant difference.  That being said, that doesn't really cover for her lost equity in an appreciating market *unless* there were specific issues in her home not mentioned in the article (roof, plumbing, foundation etc).  You can conclude there weren't considering the increased appraisal at the third run.\n\nAlso, there's this little tidbit I found interesting-\n\n>They controlled for crime, walkability and other factors that could effect home prices. After those factors were controlled for, homes in Black neighborhoods were underpriced by 23% or about $48,000 per home. Cumulatively, there was a loss of $160 billion in lost equity.\n\nHow do you control for crime and walkability and \"other factors\" in determining home value?  Those are key factors in determining the value of a property.  I refused to look at first floor units in my county because first floor units get broken into a lot.  Lo and behold, the second floor units went for more, but despite a lot of break-ins to vehicles and apartments, neither I nor my neighbors on the second (or third) floors experienced a break-in in three years.  First floor units went for the least and this was a big part of that.\n\nSo, how do you \"control\" for core factors of property value?  This is like controlling for \"gang violence\" when compiling data on mass shootings- you can't and come up with anything but disingenuous data.",

You technically can’t argue it if the value is supported by the data in the report. It’s very easy to have a shitty appraisal that is reviewed by a third party and accepted by a bank as long as the data supports it. Shitty value from shitty data happens all the time. That’s banking. \n\nI don’t think this is the case with this property though. $150k is probably a reasonable market value, but from a high level there is no way I would underwrite a loan for property in Cincinnati with a value that has supposedly \ngone up 150% in four years (with no apparent improvements). \n\nJust ain’t happening...regardless of whether you’re black, white, brown, or purple.",

            "text": "Speaking as a former appraiser:  This is just NOT at all how appraisals work.  There are plenty of examples of REAL institutional racism without this kind of disinformation.\n\nFirst, yes, appraisals are often corrupted for all kinds of reasons, but they are corrupted UPWARD specifically in ways that provide a financial incentive... like developers providing appraisers with their own comps that weren't at arms length or developers pressuring appraisers if they want repeat business.  The common thread in ALL these kinds of corruption is that they drive appraisals UP... not down.\n\nSecond, most people just do not understand the concept of an appraisal.  They think the color of their walls or the  quality of their carpet affects the appraisal.  It just doesn't.  In fact, most of the time even high ticket items like granite countertops don't make it in at all unless it's highly unusual for the neighborhood.... and often not even then.  The appraiser couldn't care less about African decor all over the walls any more than they care about whether the lawn has been mowed.\n\nThe appraisal is based only on two things:  The property, and the comps.  As far as the property, only quantifiable items like square footage count.  A VERY FEW adjustments are sometimes made if it's the ONLY house in the neighborhood that does or does not have some major item like a brand new roof.  That really is about it.  Porch or no porch, number of bedrooms... really basic quantifiable items.  90% of the stuff people would show me to afffect the appraisal is irrelevant.  It might or might not affect what someone is willing to PAY for the house... but it doesn't affect the appraisal at all.\n\n9 out of 10 times, if you have two significantly different appraisals, it's because they used different comps.  Most appraisals are only based on 3 recent sales, so if a new sale popped up, or another appraiser disqualified one for some reason, that's the major bulk of differences right there.  In a rapidly fluctuating market like we have right now, even the SAME appraiser could end up giving a MUCH higher appraisal within a short timeframe as new comps are listed.  I've doubled my OWN appraisal six months later for the same house due to different comps in a rising market.\n\nOver the years, I've heard people claim all kinds of things drove their appraisals.  Usually just a quick look at the historic data shows they were ASSUMING those things mattered when if fact the appraisal was cut and dry... but the comps changed.",

Also people were offering way more than the listing price.  The competition is unreal.  My offers for a house kept getting denied left and right, but luckily was able to get accepted recently. \n\nIf the appraisers appraised her house within a few days of each other , than her test would be valid, but she tested with months in between. Housing prices could change a lot in that time frame.  Usually not by that much though, but the pandemic could make this possible. Now I don’t know if it’s the same for where she’s from but this was the case in Las Vegas. \n\nI’m not saying African American doesn’t experience this prejudice because certainly they do, but for this lady, it doesn’t seem so.  Just my opinion though. Don’t flame me please for stating an opinion.  I more than welcome your opinion and willing to learn from different people’s perspective",
