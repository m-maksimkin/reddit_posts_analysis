Rather, I think this guy is very representative of a growing piece of the public, and a warning for where having \"too open\" of a mind can take you.\n\nHe has taken the same road as r/conspiracy, which I think many used to agree was an interesting subreddit even if many posts were downright imaginary.

The thought of those poor little children, so young and innocent, being slain by that lunatic, it still is too much to bare, and I'm a complete stranger.  That was years ago, and now I have my own son in kindergarten.  I haven't forgotten anything I felt that day and it often randomly comes to mind as I'm dropping my son off for school.  The thought of losing him that way, scared, away from me, seeing such horror in his last moments of life.  Hell I can feel my blood pressure spiking and I'm tearing up just thinking of it.  For this disgusting monster Alex Jones to tell anyone their child never existed after such an event goes so far beyond anything I expected him capable of it didn't seem real until I heard it right from his mouth.  He got the stupidest people imaginable so angry at the parents of these poor children, and in many cases some of these stupid people sought out those poor parents to scream at them.  There's absolutely no depth to that level of depravity.  \n\nAnyways, seeing this news, knowing what is ahead of Alex Jones, it is the first time after Sandy Hook that I've seen any kind of movement in the right direction at all.
