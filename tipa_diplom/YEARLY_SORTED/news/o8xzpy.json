Unsure, but they must act so everyone knows this cannot happen again. They could sue her to enforce the etiquette that all streetside audiences must follow as part of being there, or they could forgive her and ban everyone from being streetside.

And before you make that smart-ass comment about the length of the race, no one is saying the whole 2000 mi route needs to cordoned off, but obviously and logically they should have cordoned of that section of track. Someone could have tripped and fell into the road and caused the same crash. FFS a squirrel could have ran out in front of the pack and caused the same crash. The density of the racers was a recipe for disaster and crashes like these have happened before in cyclist races from different causes.\n\nOn any other day, if someone was standing on the edge of the road like that, and a cyclist hit them, who would be at fault? Now the cyclist who hit her didn't have much choice, if he braked, the crash would have still happened. So logically there should have been barricades there.

A guy teeing off 230 yards hits a beauty right up the gut of the fairway, only hit someone where his head joins his neck. You could hear the player yelling \"FORE\" but he didn't hear or ignored it.\n\nHe dropped in a way that was very frightening and and the hundreds of people there just stop talking. I radio for the manager to stop people on the tee and start rendering first aid.\n\n\nI get to him and can see blood coming from either inside his ear or where it merges onto his jaw, he's laying on the other ear, so it might have just been puddling there. I'm sort of panicked at the moment so I just give him a once over to make sure he's actually still breathing, and once that was done, radioed for a paramedic.\n\n\nI actually look at my watch to see what time it was and settle in to wait beside the guy. My buddy with keeps other people back so I can keep watch. Finally he stirs a bit and I look at my watch again and its been over 10 minutes, so I radio again asking where the paramedic was and he responds it was taking time to open a gate so the ambulance driver can drive out there.\n\nHe regains some sense, so I tell him to get into 3/4 prone position  if he can, so if he passes out, he won't have a blocked airway. I converse with him for a bit, trying to ascertain how bad he is, and his answers seem to show some level of awareness. He gets to a seated position but by then more qualified people have arrived so I wash my hands of it.\n\n\nI have seen other bad sports incidents and got one on film.\n\n\nhttps://imgur.com/DWbBFQQ",
