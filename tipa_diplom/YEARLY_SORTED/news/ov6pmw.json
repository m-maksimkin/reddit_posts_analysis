I know it’s human nature to find groups to hate and scapegoat but, with the Delta variant, some of this isn’t adding up to me.\n\n“Covid is spreading because of unvaccinated people”—Is this really true? I thought the Delta variant could break through vaccination? So it seems like it could be spread from vaccinated people, too.\n\n“Unvaccinated people are putting kids at risk”—Again, if vaccinated people can get the Delta variant then they can spread it to their unvaccinated kids.\n\n“Unvaccinated people are putting immunocompromised individuals at risk”—As a person who has been immunocompromised (and was during a part of the pandemic), I can confirm that EVERYONE puts us at risk. We have to be extremely careful about getting sick or getting any kind of infection. We have to be careful about who we spend time with, where we go etc. For a second there, I was only spending time with folks who had been vaccinated for covid. If the Delta variant was spreading during that time then I could have gotten infected by a vaccinated loved one! Because, to reiterate, Delta breaks through vaccination. \n\nYes, the vaccine prevents severe covid from Delta  but, because only breakthrough hospitalizations are being recorded, we actually don’t have an accurate picture of how many vaccinated folks are walking around spreading it.\n\nIf you have any counter arguments, I’d like to read them but please be respectful in your response.

Nobody gets side effects *months* after getting the shot. Hundreds of millions of people got one or the other vaccine already, months ago. If there was anything wrong with them, it would have showed up already. They are safe. FDA is expected to issue regular approval for two of the vaccines by the end of the year; but since they already have emergency use approvals, there's no rush and the paperwork for that usually takes about 6 months to go through (hence end of the year estimates for Pfizer and Moderna approvals, because regular process, which is just paperwork reviews and double checking numbers, just started a month or two ago).\n\nThis is not to mention that clinical trials of these vaccines on actual people started a *year* ago. These included tens of thousands of people for each of the vaccines that are available today. So if somebody wants to wait for a *year* to see how other people who got it fared, a year has already passed. A ton of people who got it during trials got it a *year* ago, and they are all doing just fine.\n\nWhile this couple may have honestly just wanted to wait a year, I'm kind of doubtful. The vast majority of people who are unvaccinated today simply don't and won't get that shot. Not tomorrow, not 10 years from now, no matter how much time passes and how much evidence there is that these vaccines are effective and safe.",

(That is a decision she says she will always regret. DuPreez has now gotten the shot along with their oldest child.)\n\n3) Now she is pleading with others to get vaccinated, to save lives and prevent the unimaginable heartbreak they are now going through.\n\nAnd it’s #2 and #3 that make me the most sad for her and her kids (who are growing up in a stunningly ignorant household). \n\nI’ve read news articles for the better part of a year where folks from their deathbed are saying “take Covid seriously, it’s no joke!” Or “I should have worn a mask/gotten vaccinated IF I ONLY KNEW HOW BAD THIS WAS GONNA BE!”\n\nIt’s like, I get it, you are huge dummies who get your news from Facebook and conservative places. But don’t conflate that with the world somehow not being on the ball or on top of this. \n\nFolks have been screaming from the rooftops to stay safe, wear masks, social distance, get vaccinated. 600,000+ dead. And we’ve known Delta is killing folks in their 30’s for months now. \n\nNo, the libs aren’t sissies. We aren’t sheeple. We aren’t wimps. We are just regular folks aware that a simple vaccine or a little mask, or avoiding super crowded indoor venues for a bit will do a world of good in terms of preventing bad outcomes. We don’t get out news from sources that profiteer off of keeping us ignorant. But folks like this family do. So they plow right into foreseeable harm for no good reason. \n\nAnd I’m just sad that this family goes through a totally avoidable outcome - all because they can’t see the world for what it is. This insane fear of the vaccine and the “I just want to wait til more people have it cause I’m scaredy of the side effects” bullshit is getting folks like this killed every day. \n\nAnd the worst part is that her plea to folks to get vaccinated will fall on deaf ears. \n\nHow do I know that? Because she didn’t listen to the thousands of folks who have been screaming at her to get vaccinated from THIER death beds until it was her fiancé.\n\nGet vaccinated folks.

You're very safe from C19 in all of it's current variants if you are double vaxed.  I had C19 and was very worried that combined with my asthma I'd be in the hospital.  I had a case that would fall somewhere in the mild to moderate range.  Not much worse than the flu.  Others haven't been so lucky. I was able to rest easy until the vaccines became available that natural immunity would then carry me through.  Worst case I'd likely get an even milder case.  I say all if this because it's up to each person to look at the numbers and do their own risk assessment.  For me the risk of an emergency use vaccine was worth it to not wind up with further lung problems.  I don't fault anyone who is young and healthy deciding to wait it out.  Regardless of what anyone else things they are not putting me at risk.  The percentage of hospitalized cases at this time shows it's virtually all the unvaxed. They have the right to make those decisions/choices/risks about their own health.  This thing may give me cancer in 20 years.  Who knows.  Then maybe they'll get their validation.  Or maybe they get the next variant and die.  We all have to draw our own conclusion based on as much data as we can get our hands on. It all should be out there.

Here are their thoughts:\n- there are lots of cases (even fatal ones) about side effect of vaccines, if I chose to get vaccinated, and if I got such adverse effects, it's my fault. I shouldn't have actively going to get something bad into my body.\n- i'll be very careful and be doing all hygene practice. Infection rate is still quite low in our city. If I got infected, it's not me who choose it. I got really unlucky. But, I think I won't be of that much bad luck...\n\nI think these thoughts are quite common, not just around vaccination. We hate choosing the wrong choice worse than having bad outcome when it's not ourselves choosing it.\n\nHere is an idea: how about having all governments to send invitation to all citizens to get vaccinated. Not mandatory to be vaccinated but citizens needs to actively opt out. Promotion message can be something like: do not choose to harm yourself or your family, just follow everybody, do not opt out!\n\nI also blame media for making it a bigger deal than it is, when reporting adverse effects. I feel that after waves of infection and waves of reporting from ICUs, those news items are not \"sexy\" anymore. People won't click. People dying because of the vaccines is \"new\" news, sexier, jucier, and attracts more clicks. Don't get me wrong - bad effects needs to be reported and pressure should fall back to the governments, scientists and manufacturers of vaccines to make them safer. But if a news channel is going to report all bad effects for vaccinated, please do exactly the same for all rushes to the ICUs. That should bring the audience into proper perspective: bad effect with vaccination is bad but being rushed to ICU is worse!",

Some of the greatest chapters in the history of humanity are our war on disease. Mankind’s highlight reel would certainly consist of space travel, fantastic works or art and the invention of vaccines. It’s really cool to take part in one of the triumphs of our species. The smallpox vaccine was experimental. The covid vaccine is a relatively untested version of a safe form of medicine with a very very well-studied history. Saying a vaccine is “experimental” is a cop-out and dishonest IMO. I guess my point is; you aren’t special enough to wait this one out. Nobody is trying to hurt you, nobody is being careless with your health (except for anti-vaxxers). You aren’t “watching out for yourself” by not getting vaccinated, you’re being a narcissist who thinks this decision is it’s up to *you*. It’s not.

We might not get rid of covid but at least people would have a better chance. \n\nIts not a cure, its not going to stop you getting it but if you do, you are less likely to end up dead. Which means less people ending up in hospital, less ventilators being used. If we didn't have the vaccine, no masks, no social distancing, it would spread very quickly, more people in hospital, not enough Drs, nurses, ventilators meaning those who would most likely survive even if it meant weeks in hospital are more likely to die.

One of the most important failures revolves around the lack of time available for counseling. If you look at just about any guideline put out by any expert panel, you will find a common thread. Almost every time, the recommendation will start with “We recommend discussing the following options for therapy with the patient…” \n\nOnly after a sentence like this will the publication start listing what the current consensus is regarding how to treat or prevent the disease or disorder in question. Doctors know this, but putting into practice is very challenging.

We aren’t following our own guidelines. \n\nThere are exceptions and uncountable examples of people who remain willfully ignorant out of arrogance. These people do choose to put other people at risk.

My symptoms are so mild though, that if it there wasn’t a risk of infecting other people, I wouldn’t have a second thought about going about my normal life. \n\nIn my area, there was excellent mask compliance and capacity limits at stores, but then a few months ago the restrictions were lifted, and now case rates are going up. I believe that mandatory mask wearing is essential to slowing the spread of the disease, it may even be more effective than universal vaccination. I believe that vaccination is important for slowing the spread and more importantly for reducing the severity of the disease.\n\nI’d like to see more awareness amongst vaccinated people that they are still vulnerable. I’d like to see a return of mask mandates. And I would like to see less vaccine hesitancy, being vaccinated may have saved my life or spared me from severe long term consequences.",

THAT is tragic. People who are on organ transplant waiting lists who lose their lives.....that's tragic. \n\nThis is not tragic....it was the result of a series of poor, conscious choices over a period of MONTHS. At ANY point in the last 90+ days, they could've strolled into a facility and received a shot...the same shot that we'd all been hoping was just around the corner.\n\nTo stick to this path, you have to discount the opinion of countless credible medical sources and instead cling on to rumors and conspiracies propagated by people who are, let's be really honest, not scientists or doctors. For those folks to be right, a WHOLE LOTTA people who generally know what they're talking about have to be wrong. And then you have to be willing to ignore the data surrounding death rates among the vaccinated vs unvaxxed.\n\nLastly, people who are lying tend to stick to a single narrative in order to work towards a specific desired outcome. I can't help but notice that the 'evil' CDC actually changes its guidance on a regular basis....sometimes more aggressive, sometimes more conservative, based on data that comes in. That should, in my mind, increase  their credibility. They're doing what they can with the data that's in front of them.\n\nAre the drug companies ecstatic with the money they're making? I'm sure they are. They absolutely should make money from it. It sure as hell shouldn't cost them money, and it should be taken into account that time spent on this drug means less resources for other projects, so there would be an opportunity cost if they were to do this at cost.\n\nJust because they're making money on the solution doesn't mean they caused the problem.\n\nSorry for the long post, it's my first ever on the topic, I am just struggling to stay silent, especially knowing a small number of my in-laws are in the \"wait and see\" boat because a friend of a sister said whateverthehellshesaidbecausesheisnotadoctorinanycase.
