They could also add a basic fence to show people where to stand. The latter is most likely not feasible at all, but the former should be doable to a certain extent.\n\nThey could also restrict the amount of space the cyclists are allowed to use of the road e.g. only be on \\~80% instead of the entire width (as seen where the crash happened)\n\nRight now it seems that the spectators can stand right next to the road, and then of course you risk this. It is actually baffling Tour haven't disallowed people from standing so close (or at least is not enforcing it).\n\nSo all in all, this was caused by Tour's lack of safety measures and they should be held responsible for it, not her.",

Well, I wasn't paying attention and crossed just as a relay was coming around. It felt like getting hit by a truck and it completely blindsided me. One runner ran straight into me, which knocked him over and tripped up two others. It hurt so bad and I was so disoriented that I just sort of scrambled towards the exit, then I hear this guy scream behind me \"*Hey! Where the fuck are you from? What school do you go to???*\" I can't remember if it was a coach or one of the parents. I just squeaked out my elementary school, which was a private school, and he sort of just waved me away.

Ok, so I accept the spectator's contact with the INITIAL rider warrants a fine but why would any other rider imagine they have grounds to sue the spectator? Wasn't it the first riders fault for causing a crash by not regaining control of their bike (and so on and so forth for each other rider who went down)\n\nThanks in advance for the insight folks!",

Eight other riders were seen by the race doctor and numerous more suffered minor injuries.\nThe race organisers then threatened to sue the culprit, with deputy director Pierre-Yves Thouault saying: \"We are doing this so that the tiny minority of people who do this don't spoil the show for everyone.\"\nOn Monday, the police department of the Finistère region launched a judicial investigation and put out a call for witnesses in a Facebook post. Now they have found the person in question, charges can be levelled.\nAccording to L'Equipe, a charge of involuntary injury caused by a lack of prudence would entail a fine of 1,500 Euros, provided the injuries sustained by those affected do not lead to more than three months of inability.\nHowever, the consequences could be more serious if individual riders choose to take action. Soler has already hinted he could look to sue the spectator.\n\nCyclingnews is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher. Visit our corporate site.\n\nTerms and conditions\n\nPrivacy policy\n\nCookies policy\n\nAccessibility Statement\n\n© Future Publishing Limited Quay House, The Ambury, Bath BA1 1UA.
