Just have a seat in any courtroom that has tenant friendly laws (Rhode Island for instance)\n\nTldr;\nYou don't need to be rich to use the courts to fuck with your antagonist\n\n\n\nFor starter any attempt for eviction is a civil matter, so the police absolutely won't help you until there is a court order. Landlord has no right to enter apartment without proper notice and absolutely can not touch tenants items.\n\nOnce a tenant has decided not to pay, it will be minimum of 1.5 months before you can set a court date. When the tenant doesn't show, the court will judge in favor of the landlord, and set a date for eviction (usually a week into the next month)\n\nLandlord wins right? Not yet. The tenant, once notified by the court can then send in a rebuttal (like \"I never received the court notice\") and the judgment will be stayed.  New court date will be set (2-3 weeks), tenant will either show to fight, or not. If they show, the public defender will *now* start to negotiate \"tenant promises to be out by x date\" (this is to say \"rather than spending the $2000 to have a constable move my stuff, I'll move it myself provided you give me time).\n\nTenant now has lived rent free for 3 months (or longer if the landlord was nice or didn't file the right notices in the right order at the right time intervals, or because of things like the covid eviction deferral).\n\nTenant finally leaves, but what about back rent. Landlord won rent + possession.... So landlord will get back rent right? No. That's another court case. Which will be heard \"soon\" (months). Court case is heard, tenant doesn't show up, judge rules in favor of landlord. Now? No. Another hearing to set terms of payback. \n\nFinally court has ruled the terms (essentially garnishment of wages) ... And landlord now receives....wait for it.....$100/month until back rent is paid.\n\nSo let's say tenant owes $3000 (3 months rent because tenant withheld rent during the entire eviction process) that's $3000 loan at 0% interest that's paid back over 30 months.\n\nOh and that doesn't include legal fees.\n\nTell me again who is getting screwed here? Not the \"poor\" tenant.",

Is there something genetically flawed that render them unable to fully comprehend reality and process basic logic? The conspiracy theorists out there both intrigue and terrify me. Anybody have a solid explanation why so many people are drawn to sociopaths like Jones and conspiracy theories in general? In many cases I feel intelligence, education, upward mobility/success in life correlate negatively with a propensity for conspiracy theories but not always. I am well educated, quite wealthy, and have had a lot of good luck in life, with plenty of hard work as well because I didn’t come from much. I’m surrounded by many similar friends and colleagues and hardly anyone I know subscribes to such craziness but there have been a few, and more so in the last few years. Social media doesn’t help; it definitely seems to replace the critical thinking phase and cause people to skip straight to a conclusion that fits their ill-formed preconceptions, which is terribly tragic.
