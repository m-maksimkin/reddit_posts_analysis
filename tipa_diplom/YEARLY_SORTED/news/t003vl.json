They're clearly in his camp, what with paying him visits on the 4th of July, Trump licking his boots, etc. Republicans are good for Putin, Democrats, not so much.\n\nMost American voters won't give two shits about this until gas prices go up. When they do, I guarantee we'll have a chorus of right wing asshats blaming Democrats for high gas prices and somehow mismanaging the situation.\n\nThose apathetic voters will think, gee, Dems = expensive gas = Dems bad. So in an election where several states have already tipped the scales with gerrymandering and laws designed to subvert the free and fair election process, we'll have a bunch of angry ignoramuses out for sweet, sweet, Democratic blood.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI dunno, just my two cents.

            "text": "I propose that international sanctions are not an unwanted repercussion of the unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine; they are the *reason* for its aggression.\n\nIn a nutshell: Russia wants to get sanctioned, and causing a bloodbath in Ukraine is just the easiest way to do it.\n\n1) Russia's most lucrative export is petrochemicals.\n\n2) Its best market for its petro has been the EU. \n\n3) However, Russia has been having real trouble benefitting from this export. This is because Russia has perhaps the highest levels of cash offshoring of any nation, as everyone - from billionaire oligarchs to the bourgeoisie - seek to offshore assets to places that are more stable, less shitty, or sell shinier wristwatches (any/all).\n\nThe result is that **petro goes out, but money doesn't really come in.**\n\nInternational sanctions are one of the few things that would address this problem. \n\nAnd perhaps the most effective way. After all, for Putin to turn the full force of the Russian state on its oligarchs would only be so effective. Moreover, it would also risk destabilizing Putin's fragile coalition as leader of the Russian oligarchy. Capital there is not substantively different from capital here in the US.\n\nBut the President of Russia can much more easily turn the full force of the Russian state against someone else. If by doing so he could provoke the full force of NATO to be turned against the Russian oligarchy - that would be one of the most effective force-multipliers in history. \n\nAny plan to court sanctions is a double-edged sword for Russia. Any sanction that prevents offshoring of capital might also jeopardize export of petro.\n\nI expect that this was the basis of Russia's occupation of Crimea. It was designed to be just enough to get sanctioned somewhat, but not enough to jeopardize exports. Perfect geopolitics: minimal effort, just enough reward, completely sociopathic, absolutely well-played.\n\nBut the calculus has recently changed. This is mostly because of the EU's new anti-emissions standards. Germany, in particular, is about to pivot hard and fast to renewables. As a result, Russia has less reason to fear the loss of the EU as a market for its petro. **The disincentive in seeking harsher sanctions is gone. Only the incentives remain.**\n\nThis is not to say that Russia could risk losing all markets for its petro. But that's not a risk. Because there's always China. Whose appetite for energy is insatiable, and whose interest in curtailing that appetite in order to punish violations of international law is zero.\n\nWith the importance of petro exports to the EU removed, Russia's interest in getting sanctioned can take the driver's seat. Russia needs to find the least bad act - an action that will draw harsh sanctions from NATO, but not risk military retaliation, and not be militarily difficult itself. \n\nAs a weak and poor non-NATO country, Ukraine is the perfect recipient of Russian bad actions. Ukraine poses little threat to the invaders and no threat of retaliation. There's little worry about the invasion of Ukraine mirroring the Russian (or US) invasion of Afghanistan, as Russia doesn't really care if it keeps the country. NATO won't retaliate militarily. And NATO will impose harsh sanctions, allowing Russia the isolation - even semi-autarchy - that is desires. \n\n**The result is that Russia will trade a failing market (EU) for a great investment (international sanctions), stop-lossed by an acceptable market (China). Turning Ukraine into a fucking abbatoir is just a stop along the way.**",

So many here are saying that NATO can't, and shouldn't, do anything because Ukraine isn't a NATO country.\n\nBut when did we decide that no democratic countries on Earth are allowed to intervene to stop an autocratic country from invading a democratic country, unless they happen to be a NATO country?\n\nIf Putin invaded Brazil would no one be allowed to stop him, because Brazil's not in NATO? Or South Korea? Or Japan? There were no NATO countries during WWII, yet we still decided it was probably worth fighting Hitler. There are only 30 countries in NATO, out of around 195. So Russia's now free to invade 85% of the countries on earth as long as he doesn't touch the other 15%? This is madness.\n\nEdit: To the 17 people who have said \"I am very smart, for you see, I have remembered that Russia has nukes! See, no can do anything. Checkmate.\" The exact same incorrect framing applies.\n\nRussia is now allowed to invade any non-nuclear country on Earth and no one is allowed to stop them? Only 9 countries on earth have nukes, so you're saying Russia's free to invade 95%+ of the world. At a certain point we have to put our foot down. You don't need to invade Russia itself, but Russia is sending troops into another country. Stomp the entire Russian military presence out of Ukraine. Say we'll stop there, and won't intervene on Russian land, but we use force to stop the Russian military invading another country.\n\nOtherwise you're just kicking the can down the road.

The result - silence. Although silence should be in Donbass.\n\nThat is why today, I want to come with an appeal to all citizens of Russia. Not as President. I am appealing to the people of Russia as a citizen of Ukraine. We share more than two thousand kilometres of border. Around it, today, is your army: almost 200,000 soldiers; thousands of military units. Your leadership has approved their movement towards us. Towards the territory of another country. This step can become the start of a big war on the European continent. The whole world is talking about what can happen any day now. A reason can appear at any moment. Any provocation. Any spark. A spark that has the potential of burning everything down.\n\nYou are told that this flame will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine. But the people of Ukraine are free. They remember their past, and are building their own future. They are building it, not destroying it, as you are told everyday on TV. Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality are two completely different countries. The most important difference is that ours is real.\n\nYou are being told that we are nazis. But how can a nation be called nazist after sacrificing more than 8 million lives to eradicate nazism. How can I be a nazi, when my grandfather has survived the whole war as part of the Soviet infantry, and has died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. You are told that we hate Russian culture. But how can a culture be hated? Any culture. Neighbours are always enriching each other culturally. Yet, that does not make them one entity, and does not separate people into “us” and “them”. We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies. We want to build our own history. Peacefully, calmly, and truthfully.\n\nYou are told that I am ordering to attack the Donbass. To shoot. To bomb without questions. Although there are questions: To shoot at whom? To bomb what?\n\nDonetsk? To which I have been dozens of times. I have seen their faces and eyes.\n\nArtema street? On which I have been on many walks with my friends in the past.\n\nDonbass arena? Where I have been rooting with the locals for our boys during the Euros.\n\nShcherbakova Park? In which we were drinking together after our team has lost\n\nLugansk? The home of my best friend’s mom. The place where my best friend’s father is buried.\n\nNote that I am now speaking in Russian, yet no one in Russia understands what these names, streets, and events mean. This is all foreign to you. Unknown. This is our land. This is our history. What are you going to fight for? And against whom?\n\nMany of you have visited Ukraine in the past. Many of you have relatives here. Some of you studied in our universities. Befriended Ukrainian people. You’re familiar with our character, with our people, our principles. You know what we cherish the most. Look inside you, listen to the voice of reason, of common sense. Hear our voices. The people of Ukraine want peace. Ukrainian authorities want peace. We want it, and we make it. We do everything in our powers. We are not alone. It’s true, Ukraine is supported by many countries. Why? Because we are not talking about peace at any cost. We are talking about peace, and about principles, justice. About everyone’s right to define their own future, of safety, and everyone’s right to live without threat. All this is important to us. All this is important for peace. I know for sure that this is also important for you. We know for sure that we don’t want war. Neither cold, hot, or hybrid.\n\nBut, if we are threatened; If someone is trying to take away our country, our freedom, our lives. The lives of our children. We are going to defend ourselves. Not attack. Defend. By attacking us, you are going to see our faces. Not backs. Our faces.\n\nWar is a big distress, and it has a big price - in all meanings of this word. People lose their money, reputation, quality of life, freedom, and most importantly, people lose their loved ones. Lose themselves. A lot of things are always lacking in war. But what is in abundance is pain, dirt, blood, and death. Thousands. Tens of thousands of deaths. You are told that Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This was not true before, not now, and won’t be in the future. You are demanding security assurances from NATO. We are also demanding assurances of our security. The security of Ukraine from you. From Russia. And from other signatories of the Budapest memorandum. Today, we are not part of random security alliances. The security of Ukraine is tied to the security of our neighbours. That is why we are now talking about the security of all Europe. But our main goal is peace in Ukraine, and the safety of our citizens. Of Ukrainians. We are determined to let everyone know about this, including you. War is going to deprive everyone of any assurances. No one will have assurances of security.\n\nWho is going to suffer from this the most? The people.\n\nWho does not want this more than anyone? The people.\n\nWho can prevent all this from happening? The people.\n\nIf these people are among you. I am sure they are. Public figures, journalists, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, doctors, bloggers, stand-up comics, tiktokers, and others. Ordinary people. Ordinary, simple people. Men, women, old, young, fathers, and most importantly - mothers. Just as much as the people in Ukraine, no matter how much they try to convince you of the opposite.\n\nI know that my announcement will not be aired on Russian television. But the citizens of Russia have to see it. They need to know the truth. And the truth is, that this needs to stop, before it’s too late. And if the authorities of Russia don’t want to talk to us, for the sake of peace, maybe they will talk to you.\n\nDo the people of Russia want war? I would’ve very much liked to be able to answer this, but the answer depends only on you - citizens of the Russian Federation.\"",

Then they said Putin would never invade the rest of Ukraine.\n\nEveryone that can have an affect on this conflict has to step very carefully. If Russia conquers and annexes Ukraine, that is something that can be undone. It will be horrible to experience, but Ukraine can be free again in the future.

Ukraine was until very recently almost fraternally linked to Russia and one of the few places in the world Russia actually wielded some influence, but Russian behavior, arrogance, paranoia, and imperialist impulses created a schism between them and pushed Ukraine into western arms, and due to Putin's blundering he was utterly unable to re-engage Ukraine in any way whatsoever. Putin is genuinely awful at actual, substantive relationship building with other nations, and so quite literally the *only* option he had left for Ukraine to reenter Russia's sphere of influence was to force it. Literally. With fucking tanks.\n\nMake no mistake, this war is in fact a consequence of Russian weakness. Imagine if the US was so bereft of influence worldwide that the only way it had to find an ally in Canadian leadership was to literally invade them and topple their government. Does that sound like superpower level influence to you? It shouldn't. The only thing Russia had as influence over its regional \"partners\" other than literally just threatening invasion was its energy sector leverage over Europe, but now with this war and the impending sanctions, he will lose even that. \n\nThis action in Ukraine is a showcase for Russian failure and weakness, and afterwards Russia will be in an even weaker position, even more isolated, even more cut off from the the world economy, even more despised by the affluent west, and facing an embolded, motivated, and reinvigorated NATO, AND facing a potential insurgency in a *neighboring* country.\n\nThis is a horrible idea on Russia's part, so much so that it makes me question Putin's grasp on reality.\n\nPutin isn't some genius 5-D geopolitical chess player. He's a dumbass.\n\n\nEdit: if the only response you have to me is to have a bot send me a suicide watch message, you're a coward and are tacitly admitting you are in an untenable position on this issue and you know it, and therefore have no real counter argument rooted in reality.

The thing I said was that if rumors are true and that Putin has Parkinson’s, it often comes with Lewey Body Dementia, which can make people adversarial, increasingly paranoid and aggressive, all while continuing to appear normal for a long time. Essentially long term memory cells get gaps in them and then fuse together and it is easy for someone to “remember” something via the wrong perpetrator, or details incorrectly. Putin has always been a power hungry manipulative SOB. If he believes he’s going crazy or on his path to destruction, why wouldn’t he care to take the world with him? He’s been setting the disinformation stage in the US to keep the war hungry among us from opposing him. It’s pretty obvious this had a purpose beyond just creating chaos and installing a puppet president. \n\nMy heart is with Ukraine and the world, and especially Russians who most likely don’t want to go to war and this madman is putting their lives and livelihoods at risk.\n\nNow it is up to the rest of the world to decide if we are going to keep on wrist slapping like the IOC in the Olympics or if we are going to prevent the next Hitler. I hope we choose correctly. The last thing I want is for my country (US) to be involved in another war, but the reality is that Russia has been in a Cold War against us for a LONG time.",

We won’t attack, but defend ourselves. By attacking, you will see our faces, not our backs, but our faces.”\n\n  \n“War will remove guarantees from everyone. No one will have security guarantees any more. Who will suffer most of all from this? People. Who wants this the least? People. Who can not allow this to happen? People. There are these people among you, I’m sure of it. …\n\n  \n“I know this speech of mine won’t be shown on Russian TV, but the people of Russia need to see it. They need to know the truth. The truth is that this must be stopped before it is too late, and if the leadership of the Russia does not want to sit down at a table for peace with …\n\n  \n… us, then maybe it will sit down at a table with you.

We have actually had it so peaceful that we've turned on each other with the stupid divisiveness that we see every day in our own media. Much of this was in no small part due to the outside influence of other nations such as Russia etc. Much of it was just done by ourselves because maybe we seek to look for conflicts in any way we can. \n\nI thought as a world we've moved on powerful nations taking these kind of actions. Growing up as a kid born in the 70s and living through some of the cold war year of the '80s and then seeing it seemingly come together in the 90s and 2000s it seemed like things were pretty hopeful. \n\nNot standing together against an action like this is the exact outcome that people wanted who have been driving a wedge through our society. People have been so busy arguing against one another over internal things that everybody's lost sight of the big picture and what we want as a society. \n\nAnd as terrible as it seems, the complete doubt and distrust and lack of confidence in anything that resembles media these days is always called into question and it's rightfully so. Most media has been trying to rile up each side of the political spectrum and propagandizing everything one way or another. And it's led us to not trust anything we haven't already come to predetermined positions on already. \n\nWe need to reunite as a civilization and say that war is nothing that we want, but we aren't going to be so afraid of it we allow these kinds of actions to take place. We need the fortitude to protect other nations and help them determine their own fate. Not cower out of fear because we've truly known no real hardship during most of our lives..\n\nI am not a religious person whatsoever, but I pray for everyone affected by this conflict and hope we can get to a resolution with as few causalities as possible. But I also hope the rest of the world doesn't take this with a grain of salt and we can finally come together to stamp out the militaristic takeover ambitions of some nations.",

            "text": "Ukrainian President Zelensky's speech before the attack:\n\n\"I have initiated a call today with the president of the Russian Federation. The result - silence. Although silence should be in Donbass.\n\nThat is why today, I want to come with an appeal to all citizens of Russia. Not as President. I am appealing to the people of Russia as a citizen of Ukraine. We share more than two thousand kilometres of border. Around it, today, is your army: almost 200,000 soldiers; thousands of military units. Your leadership has approved their movement towards us. Towards the territory of another country. This step can become the start of a big war on the European continent. The whole world is talking about what can happen any day now. A reason can appear at any moment. Any provocation. Any spark. A spark that has the potential of burning everything down.\n\nYou are told that this flame will bring freedom to the people of Ukraine. But the people of Ukraine are free. They remember their past, and are building their own future. They are building it, not destroying it, as you are told everyday on TV. Ukraine in your news and Ukraine in reality are two completely different countries. The most important difference is that ours is real.\n\nYou are being told that we are nazis. But how can a nation be called nazist after sacrificing more than 8 million lives to eradicate nazism. How can I be a nazi, when my grandfather has survived the whole war as part of the Soviet infantry, and has died a colonel in an independent Ukraine. You are told that we hate Russian culture. But how can a culture be hated? Any culture. Neighbours are always enriching each other culturally. Yet, that does not make them one entity, and does not separate people into “us” and “them”. We are different, but that is not a reason to be enemies. We want to build our own history. Peacefully, calmly, and truthfully.\n\nYou are told that I am ordering to attack the Donbass. To shoot. To bomb without questions. Although there are questions: To shoot at whom? To bomb what?\n\nDonetsk? To which I have been dozens of times. I have seen their faces and eyes.\n\nArtema street? On which I have been on many walks with my friends in the past.\n\nDonbass arena? Where I have been rooting with the locals for our boys during the Euros.\n\nShcherbakova Park? In which we were drinking together after our team has lost\n\nLugansk? The home of my best friend’s mom. The place where my best friend’s father is buried.\n\nNote that I am now speaking in Russian, yet no one in Russia understands what these names, streets, and events mean. This is all foreign to you. Unknown. This is our land. This is our history. What are you going to fight for? And against whom?\n\nMany of you have visited Ukraine in the past. Many of you have relatives here. Some of you studied in our universities. Befriended Ukrainian people. You’re familiar with our character, with our people, our principles. You know what we cherish the most. Look inside you, listen to the voice of reason, of common sense. Hear our voices. The people of Ukraine want peace. Ukrainian authorities want peace. We want it, and we make it. We do everything in our powers. We are not alone. It’s true, Ukraine is supported by many countries. Why? Because we are not talking about peace at any cost. We are talking about peace, and about principles, justice. About everyone’s right to define their own future, of safety, and everyone’s right to live without threat. All this is important to us. All this is important for peace. I know for sure that this is also important for you. We know for sure that we don’t want war. Neither cold, hot, or hybrid.\n\nBut, if we are threatened; If someone is trying to take away our country, our freedom, our lives. The lives of our children. We are going to defend ourselves. Not attack. Defend. By attacking us, you are going to see our faces. Not backs. Our faces.\n\nWar is a big distress, and it has a big price - in all meanings of this word. People lose their money, reputation, quality of life, freedom, and most importantly, people lose their loved ones. Lose themselves. A lot of things are always lacking in war. But what is in abundance is pain, dirt, blood, and death. Thousands. Tens of thousands of deaths. You are told that Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This was not true before, not now, and won’t be in the future. You are demanding security assurances from NATO. We are also demanding assurances of our security. The security of Ukraine from you. From Russia. And from other signatories of the Budapest memorandum. Today, we are not part of random security alliances. The security of Ukraine is tied to the security of our neighbours. That is why we are now talking about the security of all Europe. But our main goal is peace in Ukraine, and the safety of our citizens. Of Ukrainians. We are determined to let everyone know about this, including you. War is going to deprive everyone of any assurances. No one will have assurances of security.\n\nWho is going to suffer from this the most? The people.\n\nWho does not want this more than anyone? The people.\n\nWho can prevent all this from happening? The people.\n\nIf these people are among you. I am sure they are. Public figures, journalists, musicians, actors, athletes, scientists, doctors, bloggers, stand-up comics, tiktokers, and others. Ordinary people. Ordinary, simple people. Men, women, old, young, fathers, and most importantly - mothers. Just as much as the people in Ukraine, no matter how much they try to convince you of the opposite.\n\nI know that my announcement will not be aired on Russian television. But the citizens of Russia have to see it. They need to know the truth. And the truth is, that this needs to stop, before it’s too late. And if the authorities of Russia don’t want to talk to us, for the sake of peace, maybe they will talk to you.\n\nDo the people of Russia want war? I would’ve very much liked to be able to answer this, but the answer depends only on you - citizens of the Russian Federation.\"\n\nCredit to /u/nelyubov for the translation.",
