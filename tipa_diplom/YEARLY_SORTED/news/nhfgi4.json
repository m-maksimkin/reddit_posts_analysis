As usual stupid reactions on reddit (I don't have cable presently to see if the \"news\" responds responsibly in the context of racism), but not only does one officer warn of asphyxiation/suffocation, as one commenter points out, another officer acknowledges and the officer who pointed it out says \"that's why I'm not on his lungs\". So, again, the outcome is unexpected. This is like the fourth incident of death under prone restraint I've seen (two whites, one black, another Hispanic I think), and this video claims that supposedly none of this is taught. You almost start to wonder if \"the experts\" actually know what is being taught. It's also clear officers want people to lay there in order to calm down...\n\n[https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/us/ronald-greene-video-louisiana-police-death/index.html](https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/20/us/ronald-greene-video-louisiana-police-death/index.html)\n\nRight on cue, the dumbasses at CNN are on the one clear case.\n\n>A third officer -- who was heard in an audio recording last year describing beating \"the ever-living f\\*\\*\\*\" out of Greene -- died in a single-vehicle crash in September.\n\nHe committed suicide, dipshits.\n\n>\"I beat the ever-living f\\*\\*\\* out of him. Choked him and everything else trying to get him under control,\" Hollingsworth said on the clip. \"We finally got him in handcuffs when a third man got there.

The white teenager wasn't even a criminal. Shameful and irresponsible. I don't think these numbskulls have bad intentions, but their inability to do their jobs well is stoking things.",

Had my identity stolen and officers in 3, yes THREE different municipalities let this Bitch get arrested under my name KNOWING she wasn’t me (an officer told me that he knew right away bc I have a tattoo that’s visible on my DL picture and identity thief does not, aside from that she’s almost 6ft tall and I’m closer to 5ft. We look nothing alike). One of them treated me like it was some master plan and I let this twak maggot use my clean info. Other two were very nonchalant and blasé about it. I work in the medical field and have to get bci checked every 2y. Theft and drug possession are now going to show up unless I expunge. Call me crazy, but it should be on the negligent ass officers to have to pay that shit to be removed. I also had to pay a reinstatement fee to renew my license last month bc my identity was stolen. I’ve been cleared without prejudice of any wrongdoing, so WHY TF AM I PAYING FOR THIS? \nThey treat you like you’re a stupid waste of their precious time. Local school resource officer (that has a daughter in the same school district that he resourced for. How? TF is that not a conflict of interest?) was sitting in the office on his fat ass reading the paper when I went to get my son who had just been in a fight. I saw his lazy ass sitting there and came unglued. ‘Like WTF are you DOING that there are fights in this school every fucking day? Obviously, you’re sitting on your ass just enjoying the morning newspaper. Who pays for you to be here officer? The school or the PD? Does your daughter also abide by the zero tolerance policy? Who pays for you to be here at this school?’ And my son and I left and went right on up to the PD where I continued to Karen asking ‘WHY, can someone please tell me WHY officer P******i is a school resource officer when he isn’t resourceful? All he does is sit in the office and bs with school admin. There are fights, it’s practically lord of the flies at that school’. He isn’t the school resource officer anymore so there’s that. \nThey instill fear. ‘Oh you called me for assistance? Lemme just do a quick 15 check on you, what’s your SS#? We’ll worry about the reason you called as soon as I warrant check ya’. When your identity has been criminally stolen any warrant check becomes fear filled. They’re just…. Tremendously unhelpful.",

            "text": "The founders of the London Police Department, the first professional city force, laid out 9 principles of policing in 1829. Most civilized countries have modeled their police forces on the Met’s example, with the US being a notorious exception. \n\nThe nine principles were as follows:\n\n1. To prevent crime and disorder, as an alternative to their repression by military force and severity of legal punishment.\n\n2. To recognise always that the power of the police to fulfill their functions and duties is dependent on public approval of their existence, actions and behaviour, and on their ability to secure and maintain public respect.\n\n3. To recognise always that to secure and maintain the respect and approval of the public means also the securing of the willing co-operation of the public in the task of securing observance of laws.\n\n4. To recognise always that the extent to which the co-operation of the public can be secured diminishes proportionately the necessity of the use of physical force and compulsion for achieving police objectives.\n\n5. To seek and preserve public favour, not by pandering to public opinion, but by constantly demonstrating absolutely impartial service to law, in complete independence of policy, and without regard to the justice or injustice of the substance of individual laws, by ready offering of individual service and friendship to all members of the public without regard to their wealth or social standing, by ready exercise of courtesy and friendly good humour, and by ready offering of individual sacrifice in protecting and preserving life.\n\n6. To use physical force only when the exercise of persuasion, advice and warning is found to be insufficient to obtain public co-operation to an extent necessary to secure observance of law or to restore order, and to use only the minimum degree of physical force which is necessary on any particular occasion for achieving a police objective.\n\n7. To maintain at all times a relationship with the public that gives reality to the historic tradition that the police are the public and that the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.\n\n8. To recognise always the need for strict adherence to police-executive functions, and to refrain from even seeming to usurp the powers of the judiciary of avenging individuals or the State, and of authoritatively judging guilt and punishing the guilty.\n\n9. To recognise always that the test of police efficiency is the absence of crime and disorder, and not the visible evidence of police action in dealing with them.\n\nedited- formatting",

Just because someone can exhale (breathe out, speak, etc) does not mean they can inhale (breathe in.) The stupid excuse of speaking being used as false evidence to disregard breathing presented in all the scenarios has been stated by people who suffocate people as a false justification for their crimes. \n\nI've seen this in restraints of mental and medical hospitals and facilities. People die. The terrorists who kill them should not work there. But if you state actual medical, or any other truth, the corrupt ones manipulate to get you removed, while the cowards turn away, and the ones in charge are more scared of losing their pride to a reform that inevitably happens later, than they are correcting the problem that needs reforming. Thus all parties, except the patient, single out the only person doing what's right, because all the other parties don't want to look bad, and the truth is not what they want to hear, and so the right person is who they deem to go, so nobody else has to be responsible. Whine, whine, whine. This is in every system. On one hand you have falsely entitled immature whiners. On the other hand, you have cowards to afraid to do what they signed up for. Then the party that sorts these out is more concerned about money and attention and approval than anything else. So they conclude to sweep it away.
