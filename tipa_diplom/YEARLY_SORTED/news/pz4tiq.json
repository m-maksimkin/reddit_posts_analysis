That's the type of evil crime that really demands the death penalty IMHO.  He's a monster who has *never* shown remorse.  Taking some of his money may leave him temporarily in a deficit--he'll be back out there spreading more vile nonsense to get back on his feet.  If ever there was a moral justification for capital punishment, then what Alex Jones did is it.  I defy anyone to try and categorize what he did to those parents as anything but 100% pure evil.",

It is crazy how we are focused on this guy when really, he is just the added result of the American condition. The media is so bad, that this is actually a viable outlet to some people. Removing Jones will not fix this issue. Another Jones will just come up as long as we have CNN getting massive dislikes. They literally posted a video the other day called \"Why it is impossible to put a tracking device in a vaccine\" and all of the comments were just calling it sus.\n\nIt is funny that people here go on about how the media has a responsibility and all of this stuff, but at this point.......the COVID situation would honestly be better if big media companies weren't allowed to report on it outside of the health community. When ebola happened, there were quite a few doctors on TV discussing it.....during COVID we just have one guy who has been wrong before, and naturally, people say he is overrated. I mean CNN knows what they are doing. They know this isn't working for them. Alex Jones is a living testament of that.",

Of course, when they come to the ER, they're often at the peak of psychotic behaviour and 95% of the time they didn't come willingly so my experience does not translate every degree or nuance of psychotic behaviour, but I know enough from my readings, classes and professional experience to know Alex Jones' claims to psychotic disorder is bullshit.\n\nEdit2: I'm well aware of many although probably not all of his crazy claims over the years, but the requirements to claim psychosis are much more than just \"I claimed crazy shit over many years\".",
