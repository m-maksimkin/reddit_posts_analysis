You look at per capita healthcare spending in wealthy countries and you quickly realize that all of the countries we talk about (US, UK, Canada, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Germany, etc...), their governments are spending about the same per capita. What is different, is that the private spending by individuals and employers (in the form of copays, coinsurances, deductibles and premiums) is much higher in the United States than all those other countries. Somehow, the results are worse. The results are worse in the states that do not expand Medicaid--of which Georgia (the state involved in this story) is one of them.\n\nRefusing to take Medicaid expansion is one of the dumbest things for a politician to ever do. In Canada, provinces constantly argue for the federal government to provide them more money for healthcare (because in our country, the Constitution states that healthcare is a provincial responsibility, but since federal tax is much higher than provincial tax for people who are not high income, the provinces can't afford to fund healthcare themselves). Here in the United States, the Affordable Care Act states that if the state opts into Medicaid expansion (Congress wanted it to be mandatory, but the Supreme Court said otherwise), the federal government pays 90% of the cost. So yes, states have skin in the game, but only a tiny amount of skin. There are a lot of red states that have expanded Medicaid (Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, etc...). Oh, the \"work requirements\" that some of these red states try to add to Medicaid expansion is stupid also. Lots of people are unemployed, and lots of disabled people are able to work, but no one hires them due to discrimination. But because they can work, the government determines them  to not be disabled, so they would be treated as if they were perfectly able! The federal government not paying them benefits is bad enough, but the state government has to deny them healthcare too?\n\nThe idea of someone being billed $700 for no services provided makes no sense. If no one ever saw or treated her in any way, what are they billing her for, exactly? I have handled countless phone calls related to doctor's appointments at my workplace, and no one would ask for insurance information of a person accompanying the patient who sits in the waiting room as the patient undergoes a procedure, etc... This woman should probably dispute the bill, claiming that \"you did not provide me services, what right do you have to charge me money\"? If I bought something with a credit card, and that service is not provided (best example is if I bought a plane ticket for a date far into the future, then a pandemic hits and the planes stop flying) that is grounds for a dispute for \"service not provided\", hence a full refund of the original amount is granted.",

Second doctor was a little better about the examination, but again, it’s like he wasn’t even listening to what I was telling him. He prescribed some meds, which did help out with one of my symptoms, but the primary symptom persists, so he ordered a CT scan, which I couldn’t afford at first. Waited two weeks til I got paid and finally got the scan done. It showed nothing and the doctor is at a loss. He’s referred ne to a specialist, who still hasn’t gotten back to me after another two weeks.

It hurt so bad that I couldn’t sleep or chew. Finally at 3am I said fuck it and went to an emergency room. I get shown in to a triage/screening room with like 7 other people separated by white sheets. I wait for about 1.5 hours and finally a doctor comes in, looks in my ear, tells me I have a bad infection , to take Advil prescribed me a antibiotic ear drip and said to call my primary care doctor in 3 days if it’s not better. I leave as I’m in-network and covered without paying a dime. 3 weeks later I am getting a bill from the ER doctor that saw me for 1 minute for around $250. I was confused so I call my insurance company and they say I was covered for the ER visit but not the doctor that saw me. I was so confused, didn’t the doctor work for the hospital? Insurance basically says it’s the doctors way of getting more money after the bill is negotiated down. I call the hospital and tell them the service I got versus what I’m being asked to pay, finally they agree to knock it down to $150 if I pay immediately. I tell them to shove it and now the bill is in collections out of mere refusal to be scammed like that. I learned a lot of things that night.",

Ask for a surgery date before years end to avoid having to meet another deductible on a surgery I’ve already spent $3k on before even seeing their surgeon.\n\n5- big facility says, “oh, approval usually takes 6-8 weeks and you’re switching to “new provider” insurance next year, so you’ll just have to start over with them in January. Sorry, not sorry.\n\n6- after much cursing, ranting, and raving, I suck it up and call new insurance provider. They say I need to do X, Y, & Z. I say, I did it all in 2020, I can send you all the paperwork. They say nope, it has to be done while covered by our insurance.

I tell her my story, she tells me hers.\n\n9- I fly out this week to have the surgery in Mexico.

I went in the last time and because I didn’t meet my doctor for an establishing(meet and greet?) visit before I got my annual physical from her it was all charged to me as elective procedure. Here’s the rub. My insurance specifically states I don’t need to declare a PCP. It was a fight for the ages to get out of that bill finally trying to tell me that it was an error in the billing and coding not by the doctor so there was nothing they could do because that’s how the “code” reads. My insurance actually came through and called out the hospital and reviewed and reversed the fees. They (my insurance) also coached me how to avoid it happening again. The solution? Don’t respond to the doctor when they ask if there’s any other issues beyond getting your physical. Just say you’re here for a physical and don’t say a thing more. Bummer about that and the reason I got into this in the first place? I wouldn’t have gotten a lipid test during my annual physical if I didn’t ask in the first place. PU! Edit: If you have the luxury of health insurance. Spend some time talking to them and it WILL help you out in the future. It also makes it a lot less intimidating to use.2nd edit: I realize she had a head wound but her experience made her apprehensive as did mine. Sorry to sound like I was minimizing a head wound.",

These aren’t malicious, medical care just has TERRIBLE  billing procedure because so many parties are involved. Imagine being out $1,450 because someone sent you the wrong letter. These both happened in the last 60 days. \n\nOh, I also spent 6 months calling a doctors office every single week trying to get $300 reimbursed. I get that some doctors like to ask for money up-front because they don’t want to get f’ed by insurance or new patients (that’s me, I was the new patient) but it shouldn’t take 6 months to reimburse that much money when the insurance company has already cut the check. Speaking of which, you probably should have told them that you collected payment up-front so they would cut the check to ME. (Yes, I’m still heated about this one. “Weekly calls” was an average, in the last month I was calling an unmanned phone and leaving a voicemail every other day”). And this was for a case of secondary bronchitis—if I just hadn’t gone to the doctor at all, it probably would have cleared up on its own in 2 weeks. This one was back in 2019, pre pandemic. \n\nTrack every appointment, and don’t pay the first notice.",

Tylenol and Ibuprofen was all i had for the months of fun.\n\nAnother time (earlier) i went to the ER as i cut my hand... and while i was in the back waiting to see someone about it, a random guy came up to the ambulance entrance and shot himself.  so they evacuated the entire hospital wing, except me.  i heard the gunshot but had no idea what it was, assumed it was hospital noises cause it was just a little \"pop\"... and i sat there for a few hours while everyone else left... it was late in the evening so i had no idea all the dr's and nurses just up and left.    when they came back several hours later they freaked out when they saw me and called security, thinking i was up to something... but i was just  there playing with the open wound on my hand.  quickly stitched me up and shooed me out of there.   \n\ni was younger then and on my folks insurance so i have no idea how much that cost, but it was the same ER... for some reason just dont trust these places...",

My mom’s inability to pay for medical treatments and how blatantly dismissive the state of Indiana was when it came to disability most likely resulted in her dying way younger than she would’ve under M4A.\n\nBut as a more recent example, not too long ago, I was in horrendous pain and thought maybe it was food poisoning. Ended up screaming at one point so much that my wife took me to the ER at the nearest hospital. They transferred me to another hospital via ambulance - because they wouldn’t let my wife drive me and so I had to wait 6 hours for that - before ending up needing to have my gallbladder out. \n\nDoctor ordered a CT scan, MRI, Ultrasound, and bloodwork. I knew I was fucked when he said, “The MRI is expensive, but we had to be sure, and you’ve hit your deductible for the year anyway, right?” I’d changed jobs many months back and hadn’t even scratched the new $6k deductible. Goody. \n\nI was in the hospital less than 48 hours total with jaundice and gallstones that resulted in a gallbladder removal, liver biopsy, endoscopy, and finding out I also had pancreatitis. That, before the bills I’ve gotten from individual providers and hitting my deductible, came out to $32,724.73. Insurance “adjustments” to the tune of $28,276.25. \n\nThat then left me with a $4500 bill from just the hospital, a $300 bill from another provider, and a $1300 bill from the surgeon. So even with what would be considered good PPO insurance, I still need to come up with ~$6K because of the dumb luck of needing surgery that might’ve killed me if I didn’t. \n\nAnyone who defends this broken health system as the best in the world loses all credibility in my mind immediately. Doctors and nurses and professionals in the medical field are doing their best, but executives and administrators tying profits to a person’s health and wellbeing in any capacity whatsoever is a travesty in a developed country. \n\nBut thank god I live in ‘Murica where health insurance execs and hospital administrators keep getting their high salaries and bonuses while lobbyists bribe elderly legislators disconnected from the people that elected them to hold back universal healthcare or any modicum of benefit that might actually fucking benefit the average person. Keeping citizens alive and healthy is somehow socialist, I guess, and we absolutely can’t have that. Manifest destiny and social Darwinism are totally where it’s at. /s",

There's a medical insurance/hopsital program available in some western states called Kaiser Permanente. It has all of this: insurance, their own hospitals, their own doctors, their own pharmacies. So it escapes what is really the blatant insurance scam that most of the medical/insurance industry is part of. Their doctors and hospitals aren't going to overcharge because *they* are also the ones that end up paying the bills.\n\nIt is not without its issues--like all large companies, they sometimes base decisions more on corporate financials than medical care, but there is *never* the case of a patient not knowing what the cost is going to be and going broke because of medical care.\n\nMaybe the US should start forcing all insurance companies to start doing things this way, and stop this unexpected expense/subcontractor or massive bill inflation through creative coding nonsense.",

They treated me like I was dumb for coming back in and I told them it hurt way worse and I couldn’t sleep. \n\nGot on the plane for a 4-5 hour connecting flight to LA.

Was at the ER for maybe 1.5 hours since it was about 2 am and ended up just getting a pain shot and some prescriptions because my ear was too swollen to see into. I had an internal and external ear infection.

The off shoot of that quick fix is that people without insurance or enough insurance see massive bills getting sent out, since the system now believes they should continue charging the master list rate. What most people don’t realize, and in reality is partially how the system was intended to work following the insurance nonsense, is that you can just call the hospital, tell them you can’t pay this and they will lower the rate until you can, and if they refuse to lower when you offer a rate you can pay, then assume the debt is not intended to be collected at all. Besides, medical debts are not able to be tacked onto your credit score so if you default, no worries.  \n\nNow obviously the system shouldn’t be like this, but the moral here is that the hospitals themselves aren’t all bad, so of course there are bad apples everywhere and accountants are notoriously amoral but the majority of the blame does indeed lie with insurance companies for tragedies like.",

Save your money for the next time you need medical care.  \n\n\nAnd debt collectors? They are largely irrelevant. Who even answers a phone now from unknown numbers, let alone read junk mail? Once a bunch of companies have bought and sold your debt enough to the point where no one cares, contest it. If the medical bill were maybe a few thousand, chances are, no one cared enough to save the proper paper work. Contest that it is even a legit debt and get it removed from your credit report. Easy.  \n\n\nWhen I didn't have insurance I would have to negotiate everything afterwards and forget any physicians bill. Same as someone else here, I happened to get a contractor at the hospital that saw me for 3 minutes and then got a $1700 bill for him, not the rest of the emergency room bill, still $1300. Considering it was the most expensive bill and the most unreasonable, and the company with this bill was yet another company far away out of state that then told me that I should have considered this before getting myself in the emergency room, I said fuck 'em and I didn't pay it. Followed the method above, and my debt to that company does not exist and my credit score is better than ever.\n\nIf everyone did not pay their bills, it might help destroy this broken system. Or at the very least make people rethink it so that the only way for hospitals and doctors to even get paid is a universal healthcare system.",

Their website said their urgent care can handle simple fractures, which this was, meaning set and cast, no surgery.\n\nI get there, pay my $50 copay. They take x-rays, say it's broken, give her pain meds. Said they can't put a cast on, I have to drive 30 min to one of their ERs.\n\nGet there and pay the $100 ER fee. I'm getting pissed. They put a cast on my daughter. \n\nI call hospital about how pissed I am that they have false advertisement and it's costing me a lot more since with ER I also have to pay 10% of the total bill (urgent care is just copay). After calling them several days they credit my urgent care copay to the ER bill.  Fuck the hospital. I told them they won't see a another dime until she's fully healed. They agree.\n\nThroughout the healing process they take two more xrays - one to make sure it's healing, one at the end to confirm it's healed. All three xrays are coded as the same procedure.\n\nI ask for itemized lists from both hospital and insurance. One of the xrays I'm being charge full price for. I call insurance company. Eventually I'm told that procedure wasn't ran through my plan correctly, they'll rerun it.  If I didn't take the time to ask for itemized list, and have the ability to understand what I'm looking at, I would have been paying an extra 1500 or something for that procedure.

They had to call a helicopter to flight for life me from NM to TX (I live in CO). I spent a long time in the hospital and then 6+ months in a neck brace. I am still dealing with medical repercussions today and this was 10+ years ago. \n\nInsurance (Medicaid) didn't want to pay for it because the hospital didn't check a box that said it was an emergency and apparently only emergencies were covered if I visited an ER outside of CO. So me with a traumatic head injury that was giving me migraines and causing my hands to shake uncontrollably which turned out be micro seizures had to deal with getting all the paperwork changed to say it was an emergency because the fact that it was for a broken neck from a car accident that required a helicopter ride wasn't proof enough. This which you think would have been easy was absolutely not. It involved hours of being hold dozens of phone calls and some of it never got resolved. The major hospital biller that I was working with apparently quit a couple weeks into me dealing with her trying to get this all resolved and it was weeks before a new person took the case and I had to start over because apparently she hadn't actually done anything.\n\nThen trying to find a neurologist in CO to see me took forever. I am convinced that the reason I have so many residual issues is because if how long it took to find someone to take a look at me. I was given a website with a list of Doctors that took medicaid. So I started calling numbers the first was senor citizen home, the second wasn't taking new patients, the third was out of business, the next could see me in 4 months, it kept going like that tell I found someone who could see me in a week. That was great except when I got there they were a plastic surgeon who specialized in scalp restoration. Which was not what I needed as I still had a giant gash in my head and as he put it I don't do anything with that until it is healed over. Turns out he was still super helpful and since I hadn't seen a doctor since getting back to Colorado because of the whole emergency/non-emergency fuck up he cleaned the wound and changed the bandages something I or a family member had been doing by myself at that point. He also pointed me to a Doctor who would look at my head wound and see what needed to be done because at this point I still had a huge chunk of my scalp missing. That guy turned out to be great and was able to do the surgery I needed to put my scalp back together completely (it needed to heal over so that all the bits between my skin and my skull had completely regrown then surgery to cut it back open and put it all together properly to minimize the look of the missing piece of scalp. \n\nI still however had not found anyone to help my brain issues migraines, shaking of my hands (I'd hold a water glass and my hand would shake until water would go all over the room), memory loss, depression along with other issues. I eventually got an appointment slightly over a month out then a friend of a friend got me an appointment a week out. However when I got to that one they would only work with me if I had a lawyer and was actively suing someone because of the car crash. They literally had me call their lawyer while I was their for the first appointment. I decided not to agree to use their lawyer and so I went with the neurologist who able to see me in a month. The bullshit kept going on and it would take another post this long to tell it all. But bottom line our medical system sucks.",

It was at a smaller hospital in southwest Atlanta and I was the only person in the waiting room. It took them an hour to get me past the waiting room. Once they brought me back, it was another hour before someone came to check on me. The layout of this area was a large room with the nurses station in the center surrounded by beds lining the walls and each bed had a curtain around it. Every bed was open except for the one I was in and there were probably 5-6 nurses at the station talking and joking. \n\nOnce someone came to see me, they said that all they could do for me was prescribe me something for the pain until I could get to a dentist. So I’m waiting for my prescription, still in incredible pain. I eventually fell asleep from exhaustion and when I woke up it was 9am. The pain has subsided significantly so I decided to just leave without my prescription. As I walked by the nurses station, one of them asked if I needed help and I told them I didn’t see any point in waiting any longer and they scrambled around the desk a bit and found my written prescription which had probably been there since around midnight and gave it to me. I didn’t go fill it, just went to a dentist. \n\nSeveral months later, I received a collections call stating that I owed the hospital over $500. The nurses literally sat on their asses trading stories and shooting the shit all night and I paid over $500 for laying on a bed until my medical issue sorted itself out.",

I called the sleep department and was told by multiple staff that I was being charged too much and that the study should top out at $800 at the\nmost and could be as low as $200 if I didnt have insurance and that it wouldn't be due before coming to pick up the equipment. \nThey ended up cancelling my sleep study telling me to try and figure out if the charge was a past bill for \nsomething else before setting up a new appointment. The bill dissappeared once the study was cancelled. \n\nI then received a call from the sleep study department on july 13th \nexplaining to me that I had until the end of day on July 15th to get the sleep study done that was approved by my insurance and was told that I would not be charged the $1097.00 again and to go ahead and \nsetup a appointment for the 15th and if I did have trouble with the bill to contact the head of the sleep study department at the hospital and she would get it straightened out for me. \n\nI contacted them once I received the bill in the mail for the exact same $1097.00 and she said that she can't help me with billing issues and to call the hospital financial department.

Handed insurance card + ID and said thats all they needed).\nIn the end, all organs and bloodwork were fine. No actual diagnosis or even a hypothesis given. Picked up ONE pain pill from pharmacy and went home around 5am. Couple weeks later, an ‘explanation of benefits’ from insurance came with a balance due to hospital; i set it aside and waited for bill. \nNINE MONTHS later I got a bill for several thousand dollars. (Should have been a $75 deductible for ER visit)\n\nCalled insurance, they said I was ‘admitted’ and it was a 2day (pre&post midnight 🤷‍♂️) stay. And since it was over 60 days I couldn’t ’dispute’ with them. Called hospital, they said I signed out at 5pm NOT 5am. More than 12 hours = I was admitted, etc. Pay Up!\n\nI had them send an itemized bill. Saw the discharge time. Called back and told them it was wrong. Basically they said ‘Oh Well, Pay it’. \n\nThis is where I got to have fun. Having the names of hospital admin and all caregivers involved, I told them Unfortunately for you, I am a government employee which would have been clear via my insurance card. And before I left, I sent my supervisor an email from my work cell stating due to lack of sleep from ER, I would be going home to take my pain pill and missing work. And that the location data for that phone would clearly show I did in fact go home at 5am. And the email would be on a government server somewhere still accessible for me to produce. And it sounds to me like you are trying to fraud me as well as my insurance. \n\nThey called back the next day telling me they looked into it and it was an error. Meant to be 5am, not 5pm. (As if some random nurse remembered a random patient from nine months prior and corroborated my story that fast). They will remove the extra ‘day’ from the bill and expect payment on the remainder. \n\nNope! It’s been almost a year, and you waited KNOWING I wouldn’t be able to dispute through insurance. I’m not sending a dime until you do the following: 1)Completely eliminate the original claim to insurance. 2)Submit a NEW claim with ALL the appropriate data. 3)My insurance sends me a NEW explanation of benefits. 4) You send me a new ITEMIZED bill with all the correct information within 30days. THEN I will examine it, talk with insurance, and make the appropriate payment if/when we agree everything looks accurate. \n\nIt’s been like 5ish years. Neither my insurance company, nor I have heard a single word about it since. 🤷‍♂️\n\nOOPS, that was pretty long. Lol\n\nTL;DR ER tried to overcharge me (by a couple thousand). I had proof they were lying. Told them I wasn’t paying unless they cancelled the original claim and re-submitted the claim properly. 5yrs later, haven’t heard a single word from them.",

I was told ~$500 or so. Asked if it was a copay or the full amount. The member services rep said it was showing my cost out of pocket as ~$500. Well I was able to crowdfund that amount because I certainly couldnt afford it but I also don't want to live with my chronic pain that I have had for almost 9 years, so I needed to be seen.\n\nAfter the procedure, a few weeks passed and I received a surprise bill for an additional $600 or so.

If my private insurance denies a claim of mine for any reason, the VA shrugs and eats the bill. No sh#t.\n\nI have a pretty extensive medical history with multiple underlying conditions including a genetic disease. At 80% without even factoring in tinnitus, you bet I am one limping broke dude who could barely fight his way out of a wet paper bag at age 50.\n\nI get superior healthcare compared to my wife who goes to a flagship hospital in Boston. My attendings and surgeons are all professors at the local medical universities. My residents are their graduates.\n\nFriends, this is what universal health care could be. The Veterans Administration has the capability to lead the way for all of these lousy puffed up shams masquerading as hospitals into a glorious golden age of a National Health Care system that would rival Britain's NIH.\n\nIf we only had the will to follow through with the vision. Socialism. But only for the veterans. I am chewing up my words and spitting them out bitterly as only a veteran can.\n\nIf we can do it, we can afford it. The American people deserve better than the status quo. It beggars our humanity as a nation, that we don't. \n\nI want you all to have what I have, but without having had to go to war for it.
