We were all thirsty for some drinks, so we went to this little straw hut bar that was close to our villa. About 15-20 minutes later, a guy walked in with a bird perched on one of his shoulders. He sat down and started conversing with us asking us where we were from and what we were doing in Belize. We found out that he had a property on the island and had been living there for some time. We joked around saying life must be good for him to be able to afford a place on the island. Then he started complaining about one of his neighbors, saying how much of a dick he was. He said they constantly had fights over noise complaints. \n\n\nFast forward to a few years later, I get a text from one of my co-workers. He sends me a news article about John McAfee being accused of murdering one of his neighbors. Out of all the pictures they could have chosen, they chose one with the man and his bird. That's when I realized it was the same guy that we had talked to a few years ago when we were in Belize!",
