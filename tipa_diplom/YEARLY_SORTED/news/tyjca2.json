What happens if Judge Breyer withdraws his resignation?  What happens if Judge Breyer died (theoretically) before end of term, would Jackson have to wait till end of term?  What happens if President Biden died (only theoretically) before Judge Breyer's resignation date?  Wouldn't that invalidate nomination and hence confirmation?  I don't recall a previous SC Judge being confirmed without an open spot.  \n\nCongratulation future SC Judge Jackson.\n\nFrom CNN \"But Jackson won't be on the bench quite yet: She will not be sworn in until after Justice Stephen Breyer retires.  \nIn his letter to President Biden in January, Breyer said his retirement will be effective at the end of the current Supreme Court term, assuming that his successor is confirmed. The term is expected to end sometime late June or early July. \"",

We have moles in Congress that are working against the Democrats while hiding behind the Democrat name.\n\nWe need a leader that is able to make change and a role model that the people want to support. Instead we get geriatrics. 16 congressman are 80 and up, while over 100 congressman are 70 years old and up. We need maximum age caps and term limits in congress. We need age caps for president. We need constitution tests for people to run for any government role. We need leaders that are still young enough to understand what the current generations are going through and how the world really works today, instead of 40-50 years ago when they first stepped foot in office.",
