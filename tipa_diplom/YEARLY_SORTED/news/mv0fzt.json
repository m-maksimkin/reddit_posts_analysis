The defense witness’s old residence being smeared with pig blood and a severed pig head left there is a form of jury intimidation.

The full video demonstrates that he likely could not breath because of a panic attack combined with the effects of [multiple drug and health comorbidities and Covid-19 infection.](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/04/869278494/medical-examiners-autopsy-reveals-george-floyd-had-positive-test-for-coronavirus) The knee-to-neck hold that Officer Chauvin used was excessive for the circumstances but that hold is standard training and is allowed specifically because it is known not to choke. They should have rendered some aid, but it also is very unlikely that it stopped his breathing. Even the paramedics couldn't do much, so I am not sure what the officers could have done. The police actions were mostly reasonable, but the [videos got cut up, edited, and spun by the media](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ESGXmWh0z7c) to create a juicy and profitable narrative.\n\nI even went through the effort of time stamping each segment of the video so that you didn't have to spend more than a few seconds to verify what I stated is true.\n\nKnowing all of that, and how [the media wittingly spun a tale to divide Americans](https://youtu.be/KJXszppxbwU?t=9m54s), with the plan being that the full leaked footage would be kept under lock and key by the courts  until this trial was over, what do you think about that? Is that manipulative conspiring tolerable?",

End the life of derrick chauvin. Let those who serve see the repercussions of these types of actions.

That is concerning.\n\nMaxine waters, Biden, and the media inserted themselves inappropriately.  The jurors likely feared for their lives had they not given a guilty verdict on all accounts.\n\nEnd result: a somewhat likely correct result in an extremely flawed process.\n\nThe justice system, not just the cops on the street, but political injection into it at all levels, needs to be re-examined badly.  Just because the majority got the result they wanted does not mean things will get “better”.\n\nRather, we need to seriously examine what went wrong.  Because a lot did.\n\nChauvin should not kept his knee on the suspects neck as long as he did after he was unconscious.  That was excessive.  There needs to be consequences and a close look at police procedure and potential abuse of power.\n\nThe jury should have been sequestered.\n\nThe city paid millions to the family BEFORE trial.\n\nMedia was all over it.\n\nJurors safety was at risk and therefore not impartial.\n\nMaxine waters invited violence.\n\nBiden is more than welcome to comment, AFTER the ruling, not before.  Especially when the jury is not sequestered.\n\nMinneapolis has been a hotbed of anti police sentiment.  This was not a jury of his peers.\n\nThough the result may well be somewhat accurate, the process was flawed and will result in bad outcomes in the future if this is not examined and fixed.  I fully expect an appeal and another trial but I do expect 1 or 2 of the guilty charges to remain.\n\nThis is a win for justice.  But this is not a win for the justice system.  We absolutely need to keep filming, keep up the pressure, keep up the call to examine abuse of power but let’s not imagine that the glaring holes in the justice system won’t hurt the American people, just because the failures ended up in the result we wanted.

But further than that, it's shitty that this trial even happened in the first place. That Chauvin felt so empowered and comfortable, at the very start of everything, to do what he did and ignore the pleas of other humans. That he was so arrogant and cocky to think his defense would get him off the hook, that he looked so surprised to see he was getting the guilty verdicts. This is a victory, but if anything it could mean that police actions will get *worse* as they feel more scrutinized and vent their angers out on people. What we need is for situations like this to be the catalyst for serious and real changes not just to oversight for police, but for how our country handles crime, punishment and responses to things like drugs.

How do we know this wasn’t out of fear and it was pure justice? No matter what side you’re on I don’t think it’s right to let the violence influence your decision, at the same time i also don’t think it’s right to use violence to influence the decision. I’d hate to see an innocent person be sentenced like this because of the fear of backlash. I’m not saying that happens a lot but we have to be careful doing these things. There’s been many instances where the cop has been innocent, but America was still outraged just because the victim was black. We all have our opinions on this cop and wether or not he should be guilty (I think he should be guilty but I doubt it was on purpose, IMO his anger most likely got ahead of him, I’m not going to say that anger was racially motivated though because I’m not him, but he still killed someone). But at the end of the day it’s not right to motivate or to be motivated by violence. We should all do better. George wasn’t necessarily a good person either and I think a lot of people have forgotten that. I’ve seen a lot of people praise him and act like he was some holy innocent nice person, but he isn’t. Not that he deserved the death penalty, but he sure as hell isn’t an innocent person. We all know what the cop could have done better, but nobody’s talking about what George could have done better. Don’t break the law, don’t do hard drugs that will make you act like a dumbass especially in public. Also, don’t resist arrest, you won’t win anything while being arrested. The cop isn’t a judge, you have the right to remain silent. You’re still goin to jail so why even argue? I’d comply like a bitch, better than possibly getting more charges, or getting hurt. Just save it for the judge, your odds are much better that way by far. When in court you can regard brutality or excessive force, especially when everyone records everything now. \n\nY’all prolly gonna downvote me to shit but I’m giving a neutral opinion that I strongly believe to be true. I’m open to other sides though but I feel this is something we can all agree on no matter what side you are on.",

Beyond reasonable doubt is important, KNEES on the neck do not attribute to death, it has been done (although unadvisedly) for decades. Was Chauvin stupid? Yes, as an officer, a person who is handcuffed can pose a considerable threat, but in this political state, officers have every incentive to respond to medical claims (whether its believed to be fake or not). Was Chauvin guilty? Yes, but not of the more serious degrees of murder. The knee may have been attributed in conjunction to Floyd's resistance, health state and use of drugs but it is impossible to prove exclusivity in this circumstance. Take either out and it is arguable what led to the death or if Chauvin intended to kill Floyd with malice once arriving onto the scene. This is not beyond reasonable doubt. This is supposed to have been a gray area, although most have made it black and white. The trail was politically charged from the beginning with multiple political representatives irresponsibly trying to coerce and influence the courts. Just like the OJ trial, the members of the public were already biased towards one side. A fair trial should have been held privately in a different jurisdiction. It's not about the facts, it's about the story the jury believes. People wanted a man to be crucified. The fact this verdict came out demonstrates to me atleast, the legal system is being even more perverted than it used to be.\n\nTo those who believe this is a change in circumstances or this is the only fair police brutality trial in existence. I would suggest reading into the trail, medical and investigative reports of all the poster figures of the BLM movement. To this day people believe in all these instances of police brutality which are blatantly false. To this day, people believe in “hands up don't shoot” which was proven to be said under perjury of law. No one wants to read 80 pages of a report, but before you go and spread misinformation leading many to make ill conceived notions, study responsibly. You are being played, and the less fortunate people pay the price. Fact is police interaction, response and cultural sensitivity needs to be taught and be a responsible consideration in both police and members of the public. Blaming the police and labeling racist brutality does not solve that, and isn't statistically objective.\n\nPolice brutality and systemic racism is a real thing, it has played a part for decades. Does this permeate every aspect of our society? No. Is every police officer looking to shoot black people or other people of color? No. Are there bad/unqualified individuals in every profession? Yes. Will defunding the police create a more qualified and culturally understanding police force? Hell no.  The problem with BLM and its supporters is that it seeks to galvanize people against the entirety of the police force with politicians supporting it so long as they get themselves re-elected. Where is BLM in the streets I support? Never seen them. What about the millions of funding to BLM? It goes to the politicians, look up ActBlue. In fact, all the funding for street programs come mostly from WHITE PEOPLE. Officers are killing more blacks statistically because more blacks commit crime at a disproportionate rate. The truth is because these lower income, crime infested communities get no assistance from local or state governments. They are left in situations which force and mold them towards crime. BLM telling these communities that officers are there specifically to kill them, have made things worse. If you tell a child they will not amount to anything because of the system or the cops hate them- they will grow up resisting the police. When they resist 10/10 times it will be a bad day. \n\nThe Chauvin case is one of many symptoms of the disease that is our lack of deliberation, echo chambers, censorship and overall political climate. I am convinced those who support BLM or virtue signals have never seen both sides of the argument. They either are just police officers, or members of the public. If you believe this was supposed to be a black and white case, I would strongly urge to reconsider current political and social influences and look objectively.",

Doesn't being charged with murder count as one thing and then the degree is established based on the circumstances and the attitude of the charged?

I can understand the prosecutors intention to charge with several versions of the same crime in case one charge turns out to be too strong (or the evidence turns out too weak to support for example intent or maliciousness). But then again why would the jury found him guilty of 3 charges that are basically the variations of killing another human being?",

However, when I watched the footage from officer’s body cam I wasn’t so sure. Officers seemed to be treating George Floyd reasonably fair, but it was clear that he was under the influence of controlled substances. He seemed completely out of it and behaved erratically. Struggled to follow very simple instructions. I also believe the officers involved escalated appropriately given the situation. GF was exhibiting signs of OD before he was put on the ground.

I’d be surprised if Nelson didn’t argue for the judgment to be vacated based on the horrendous handling of this case by a narcissistic judge.\n\n2) until the riots of the appeal begin, welcome to the world YOU created.  LEO everywhere will be afraid to do their jobs.  You know, the ones they do when YOU call them?  God forbid you need them to respond with force to protect your life at the peril of your own.  We watched a chief of police throw an officer under the bus with outright lies and deception.  Why did a prosecution witness become a defense witness again? \n\n3) if you think a mob decimating a constitutional right to a fair trial, and forcing an outcome out of the jury out of fear for their own lives (did you watch jury selection?  I did, they were all afraid to be on the wrong side of the mob) is acceptable, then when you’re in the crosshairs, please do not cry for help.  Definitely don’t call the police. \n\n4) did George Floyd die underneath Chauvin?  Yes.  Could Chauvin had handled it way better?  Yes.  Should Chauvin spend time in jail?  Yeah, absolutely (I’m actually for harsher punishments when police abuse their power).  Did he murder George Floyd?  Absolutely not.  What led to their encounter?  A violation of the law.  Chauvin didn’t commit that violation.  That was proceeded by another violation of the law (resisting arrest), and then another with assault of a police officer. This all culminated with a police officer holding a suspect, whom they witnessed committing two of the three crimes committed (I cringe every time someone is stupid enough to say “this is all over a $20 bill.”) taking control of the situation, in a manner that has probably happened close to 20-25,000 times in the last year, minimum.  Why is this case different?  1) he died due to his own decisions and 2) it was caught on camera. \n\n5). The procedural malfeasance in this case is absolutely abhorrent, to use his own words against him.  Let’s count the ways the judge handled this, in literally the worst way imaginable:\n1) change of venue — how can you objectively surmise that a jury living in ground zero of the most violent “peaceful protests” in our history? \n2) refusal to sequester jurors — knowing the political nature of this case, and the sheer magnitude of it, did he think that everybody wouldn’t be giving their input on this?  That the jurors wouldn’t see said input? Absolutely disgusting decision\n3) allowing the addition of the murder 3 charge back to the case.  I’m aware this came from another source, but ultimately he allowed it back.  \n4) allowing a week of prosecution witness testimony which added zero factual and 100% emotional testimony.  This type of testimony is saved for sentencing.  Again, abhorrent.\n\n5) allowing Tobin all of a sudden recall information after having testified.  Which was rebutted with the single most damning piece of testimony, by Nelson.  “How can you die of asphyxiation with 98% oxygen?”  This here, is called reasonable doubt.  Period.  Point blank.  The prosecution demanded the jury believe Floyd died of positional asphyxiation.  This proved in fact, he did not.  If it didn’t prove that (re-oxygenation) then it proved co2 could have played an important factor as well. \n\n\nAgain, god forbid any of you go to court and find yourself at the mercy of a judge so willing to toss aside his oath to the judicial process, and the constitution.  I honestly hope you never, never encounter that.",

I made non-committal statements like \"that's certainly something to think about\" and \"that's interesting, I'll have to read up on that.\" On one hand I was annoyed he was attempting to steamroll me with pro-cop b.s., but the whole time I had a gnawing feeling in my stomach-- *is this how he gets away with it?* \n\nI wanted to bring up that it wasn't just about George Floyd, that his murder ignited a lengthy, highly combustible fuse laid in decades of such scenarios... but Abel was clear in his bias and would've just hand-waved or scoffed. Instead I listened, refused to take the bait and proceeded with my cardboard responses, annoying even myself but not knowing better than to engage. (An argument is a conversation no longer worth having, imo, as neither party is, by then, listening.)\n\nThen this former co-worker, the son of a marine, escalated. Abel said, \"They're ruining what makes America great.\" Then he confided he was probably voting for Trump in the upcoming election, to which I had to roll my eyes HARDCORE toward the passenger window so he wouldn't see.\n\nI got out of his car and thanked Abel for the ride, deeply relieved we're no longer coworkers. I was, however, deeply concerned another white cop was going to get away with (publicly in this case) degrading and brutalizing a black man. That night, it felt like a foregone conclusion. I entered the house that night with a heavy heart, but I feel such relief today that that night's cynicism and pro-authority horseshit didn't predict the outcome of this trial. \n\n/ my lengthy D&D anecdote",

I understand that it can be a hard job, and that it can probably chip away at people as they have to deal with shit but that's not an excuse to kill someone. It's also apparent that there is a level of racism in the US that maybe all of us outside of the US didn't fully understand. There seems to be an \"us vs them\" where people, more so those of colour, are viewed as a threat, and not just human beings. If anything, police and unions should be asking for better training or more support. I can't imagine most people who sign up to serve as police set out wanting to be bad guys.\n\nI also don't think this is an issue exclusive to the US, but it just seems the US excels and being a prime example of the problem.",

I honestly can't believe In 2021 US police departments are teaching neck restraints and \"if you can talk you can breath\".

This has been going on so long that Police are armed and agressive to protect their lives from armed criminals as much as criminals are to protect themselves from the police now. Then throw in a national mental health crisis on top. \n\nIn my opinion there are to many different forces using different training and budgets in the USA. Merging forces and standardising training would be a great step one. But unfortunately I think this need serious gun law reform to stand a chance of working. Police are still dealing with potentially armed and deadly people in each interaction. The lack gun laws allow any criminal or mentally ill person to easily obtain one legally or not.  A readily armed nation has instilled a substantial level of paranoia in officers nationwide and police require a level of agression, speed of action and quick decision making that will seriously hamper any attempts to affect the change needed. All compounded by survivorship bais. \n\nA level of historic inequality and segregation of communities will continue to make this disproportionately effect marginalised and minority communities. I have always been very shocked how segregated US cities have been on my visits and I think a serious effort needs to be made to merge these communities to stop this discrimination.",

The maximum sentence for second degree murder is less than 40 years in prison. Intentional second degree murder is intentional murder without premeditation. Second degree murder by drive-by shooting is exactly as it sounds so long as the drive-by shooting is what is defined by statute section 609.66, subdiv. 1(e). The statute for unintentional second degree murder lists two ways that this offense is committed: unintentional killing while committing or trying to commit certain felonies and certain acts in violation of an order for protection.\n\n>There are two types of **third degree murder**. The first is an unintentional killing during a dangerous act with a depraved mental state. This offense carries a maximum prison sentence of 25 years. The second is an unintentional killing relating to certain drug offenses. This offense carries a maximum prison sentence of 25 years and/or up to a $40,000 fine.\n\n**Manslaughter**\n\n>Manslaughter in the second degree carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and/or up to a $20,000 fine. This offense includes killing by negligence, killing a person by mistaking them for an animal, killing a person by setting a dangerous trap like a snare or pit fall, and other such negligent acts.",

(Scottish here, so not really well versed on your judicial system)\n\nTo clarify, as I'm talking about an appeals process, I think this man is a piece of shit. I think anyone who abuses their power is, and I hope Chauvin doesn't win any appeal and gets what's coming to him in prison.\n\nIt's my understanding that they originally didn't charge him with murder 2, only murder 3 and manslaughter. I'm not sure if it works the same there as in the UK but our CPS will only charge if they think there's enough evidence to and a chance of conviction, but in this case the charge was upped after a huge fallout from the murder 3 charge, I think?\n\nSo a question to any lawyers in here: if they didn't originally charge him with murder 2, is it because they didn't know if they'd get him on that, and if that's the case, will he likely be able to appeal that charge and serve his time only for 3rd degree and manslaughter if 2nd is overturned, which might be a likely outcome because they didn't originally charge him with it?",
