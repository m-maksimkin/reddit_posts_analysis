Even better was what happened right before we got into the White House.\n\nWhen we got into the line to go through the security screening, there was a family right ahead of us with two girls, one who was autistic. She just about lost her marbles when she saw the German Shepard working in the security tent and was so excited! Her parents were able to keep her on track by reminding her that the dog was working so she couldn't pet it. The girl was very upset but understood, however she kept talking about the dog the whole way from the security tent to the inside of the White House.\n\nSomeone must have been listening to that conversation in the tent because when we got inside, a staff member brought over one of the presidential dogs for her to see and pet! We're 90% sure it was Bo [edit: confirmed it was Bo with my husband, pup had white feet] but weren't able to get a good picture as the little girl was again losing her marbles with excitement and petting the pup like crazy. Since we were right behind them, my husband got to give the dog a pet as did my kids.\n\nWe just thought it was the sweetest thing ever, that someone would have overheard her excitement and then made the effort to bring one of the presidential dogs over for her and her family to meet. I'm sure it made her year, it certainly made our year!\n\nEdit: Thank you for the awards and I‚Äôm glad everyone has loved this story, it truly is our favorite one to tell.

His son or daughter that he has reared with loving care may prove ungrateful. Those who are nearest and dearest to us, those whom we trust with our happiness and our good name may become traitors to their faith. The money that a man has, he may lose. It flies away from him, perhaps when he needs it most. A man's reputation may be sacrificed in a moment of ill-considered action. The people who are prone to fall on their knees to do us honor when success is with us, may be the first to throw the stone of malice when failure settles its cloud upon our heads.**\n\n**The one absolutely unselfish friend that man can have in this selfish world, the one that never deserts him, the one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous is his dog. A man's dog stands by him in prosperity and in poverty, in health and in sickness. He will sleep on the cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master's side. He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer. He will lick the wounds and sores that come in encounters with the roughness of the world. He guards the sleep of his pauper master as if he were a prince. When all other friends desert, he remains. When riches take wings, and reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as the sun in its journey through the heavens.**\n\n**If fortune drives the master forth, an outcast in the world, friendless and homeless, the faithful dog asks no higher privilege than that of accompanying him, to guard him against danger, to fight against his enemies. And when the last scene of all comes, and death takes his master in its embrace and his body is laid away in the cold ground, no matter if all other friends pursue their way, there by the graveside will the noble dog be found, his head between his paws, his eyes sad, but open in alert watchfulness, faithful and true even in death.**\n\n**George Graham Vest - c. 1855**",

While our hearts are broken with the loss of our great, good boy Jamo, our other dog is even more heartbroken and depressed. She is 3 years younger, and really never knew life without Jamo.  \nI wonder if dogs with their amazing sense of smell - so far improved over all of our senses - if there is a slow fading of scents over time. Is a fresh scent like an amazing, bright neon blue, jolt to the senses? Over time does it fade to cobalt blue, then perhaps light blue, and eventually to nothing?  I see our remaking dog (Brenna) sometimes nosing and sniffing some of his old toys, his bed, and even the places in the yard where he would lay down to take the sun. \nBrenna is a much more somber dog now, and occasionally has even howled with her pain and sadness - a totally new and unexpected behavior that tears at our hearts. \nHow does one help a heartbroken dog missing their best friend?  We don‚Äôt know, but continue to shower her with love and affection...hoping it helps in some small way to ease her pain, even while her heartbreak fuels our pain. \nPoor little girl missing her Jamo.",
