Ever.\n\nWe‚Äôre also losing them because they lived in a vastly, dramatically different world than what their accustomed to, it‚Äôs stressful and you have no idea if you‚Äôve never done it before:\n\nBy no stretch of the imagination, an attempt to sanitize our way of thinking constantly by ‚Äòcanceling‚Äô fellow entertainers who‚Äôve been in the industry far longer than the innumerable politically-correct social-justice warriors isn‚Äôt helping anybody despite having the best interest at heart, I truly believe this because in-turn it makes ordinary people and them really reevaluate their lives, every decision (both good and bad) every mistake, every feeling of sadness/despair‚Äî when you get to that point, it‚Äôs pretty damn hard to get out of that mindset and some never do unfortunately.\n\nWe have to accept the fact that a lot of the consumption we‚Äôre regularly doing as Americans, especially on social-media which when you think of it is creating an antisocial/social generation only getting increasingly polarized..\n\nIt‚Äôs starting to take a toll on all of us collectively on a grand-scale but in starkly different yet similar ways..",

I met him for the first time in 2004 at a comedy club in Atlanta and told him who I was. He seemed generally pleased and scared at the same time. I saw him again in 2005 and half-way through his set he started talking about a \"weird kid\" who came the year previous and proclaimed he was God. My friend outed me and Bob spent the rest of the night roasting me. I started doing comedy in 2008 and my only goal was to one day open up for him so I could make him proud. I never got that opportunity, but I will never forget the two times I had the pleasure of meeting him. He is a big reason I became a stand-up comic and the closest thing I've ever had to a father figure. RIP God.\n\nEdit: Didn‚Äôt expect so many people to remember the website.

            "text": "Way back in the day, I had the incredible pleasure of working with him and directing him on a set. At the time I was a producer for Mattel, and we made a video game based on his television game show, \"1 vs 100.\" This particular recreation of the game called for a cast of 100 extras, and I would be in full control of them, the crew, a studio audience, and Bob. It was without a doubt the most ambitious shoot of my life.\n\nI was fucking terrified.\n\nNow, traditionally, actors are under studio contract to do merchandising gigs like these‚Äîwhich are often unpaid. As such, a lot of the time the talent is grumpy, hostile, and in a rush to get the job done as quickly as possible. A \"phoned in\" a performance was often the best case scenario, as opposed to a no-show or annoyed performer having to work on their day off. \n\nWe had booked Bob for four hours of work that day. He gave us ten. \n\nFrom the first moment, he treated me with such generosity and kindness that I'm tearing up thinking about it. \"I'm all yours today,\" he said while shaking my hand. \"Anything you need, just ask and I'll make it happen. From this moment forward, I'm your talking prop.\"\n\nThe man was a machine. He never took a break, never stopped improvising, and he constantly entertained the extras between shots. He would do multiple takes on everything, knowing it would get funnier each time. \"Let's try it again, just for shiggles,\" he'd say (shits and giggles). And it always got funnier.\n\nLike the time we had to shoot the game's ending, when the contestant (the game player) won the million dollar prize. \"What do you want to happen?\" he asked me. I was like, \"Well, what normally happens on the set?\" He laughed and said, \"Dude, I‚Äôve seen the statistics. No one‚Äòs ever winning the million dollars. The odds are so astronomically low, we haven‚Äôt even rehearsed what would happen. So let's make it up!\"\n\nAnd we did! We created a setup with the stage managers, lighting technicians, and camera operators on the fly. And on the first take‚Äîthe big moment!‚Äîhe comes out with, \"You did it! You won a million dollars! A million dollars of fake money! One MILLION FAKE DOLLARS! What fake stuff are you going to buy with your fake money?!?!\"\n\nSuffice to say, the laughs were so big from the 100 extras that the take was ruined, and we had to try again... several times. \n\nI‚Äôm so appreciative of him. He empowered me‚Äîa total stranger‚Äîtrusted me, and gave me the confidence to shoot the hell out of that game. He‚Äôll never know it, but that was a breakthrough moment for me, a moment where I felt valid, legitimate, and that Hollywood royality was no longer untouchable... they were now colleagues. From that day forward, imposter syndrome was a thing of the past.\n\nRest in peace to a kind, brilliant, and generous soul. Thanks for changing my life.",

We didn't have a million different entertainment options back then, and there weren't a lot of shows that appealed to kids.

The TGIF shows, Full House, Family Matters, Step by Step, I'd say anyone born in the early '80s probably watched all of those shows.  I can't remember anyone my age who didn't.  TGIF was such a huge part of our lives back then.\n\nPlus you had America's Funniest Home Videos, which was like YouTube before YouTube.  (Or for the youngsters, it was TikTok before TikTok).  And as we got older, he'd still pop up in stuff like Half Baked or How I Met Your Mother.  \n\nI know Cosby had the rep as \"America's dad.\"  But I was a little too young for that.

            "text": "\"The Aristocrats\" movie is hilarious and his piece is the most heinous and outrageous piece of the whole thing.  I loved it.  The whole movie is about a joke that comedians told each other at parties to out do one another.  The fact that Bob Saget could be so wholesome and so ridiculously over the top says a lot about his talent, his self awareness of the audience and a true comedic talent.  RIP.",
