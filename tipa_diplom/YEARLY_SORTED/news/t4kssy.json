For all the memes and jokes and empowering Tik Tok videos that gave us hope early on, the reality is that this is still David vs. Goliath, and stories like that are fantasies for a reason.\n\nThe Russians are almost certainly going to decapitate the government and claim the country simply because they have the lingering strength in numbers and firepower to overcome their own lack of motivation and their inept leadership. If something doesn't change inside Russia - and fast - this is going to turn into a brutal, years-long occupation full of blood and destruction that imparts lifelong scars across multiple generations of both Ukrainians and Russians. \n\nIf nobody inside Russia is willing to subdue Putin from within, putting Russian aggression down is really going to require a dedicated effort and \"sacrifice\" across the world that could take years to bear fruit. If you really want to punish Russia for the terror its unleashed in Ukraine, you need to be prepared to actually go without some conveniences for a while, not just like some Tik Tok videos and make memes about Zelenskyy.\n\nPutin has been embarrassed by his idiotically inept invasion so far, but he's still counting on the rest of the world losing interest with time and going back to prioritizing personal convenience over interest in the well-being of Ukrainians - and his inevitable follow-on targets in Eastern and central Europe.\n\nPutin can be stopped, but it's going to take a lot more than a couple of days, weeks, months, or maybe even years, for that to happen.",

While my russian is not great, they definitely still are trying to sell it as a peacekeeping \"special operation\" mission.

The average American fighter pilot flew his aircraft around 250 hours per year.\n\nIt's easy to deploy a limited Force to some place like Syria and project strength. It's very different to launch a massive invasion against a group of people who are willing to fight you.\n\nAt this point, the only thing the Russian military has going for them is there nuclear arsenal. If it weren't for the nukes the US and or the EU could just go in and decimate that entire army. Make no attempt to occupy russia, just destroy its ability to be a threat to other nations.

All of the media an news outlets reporting and most definitely giving the Ukrainians intelligence and a lot of it is coming from the US and other countries, along with satellite imagery and detailed maps showing exactly where the Russians are. Not to mention that nearly every Ukrainian has a a cellphone and can easily upload photos and send information to everyone else as nearly as quickly as they see it.  I guarantee that's part of why they are targeting communications now with that tower because the Russians are quickly realizing their positions are being given away and how much its fucking up with their logistics. The problem is, there's almost nothing they can do about it. \n\nSo along with poor planning, now that the whole world is watching and lending assistance to Ukrainians, the counter intelligence is something they idiotically never thought they'd deal with.",
