Yes, I saw some crazy theories and remedies sometimes posted there, but you have to be smart. It’s the Internet. We’re all strangers. I guess that happens when healthcare fails you though. I’m just sad. I stayed on the board for months after recovery just to be a shoulder to lean on and people were so thankful for the hope of recovery. I shared my personal stories to help others.

            "text": "As a former mod there, it was well past time for that subreddit to go. Back in February, I considered killing off the subreddit when I'd finally come to realize that the toxic culture that had developed there, despite our best efforts at moderation, was doing more harm than good. This came about after I made a pro-vaccine post in the subreddit after I had gotten my first dose of Pfizer, and got the mother of all flamings for it. I have always been pro-vaccination, but have taken a very dim view of many of the various non-pharmaceutical interventions (it should have ended with \"wash your hands\"). That flaming is where I realized that these people wanted to have their cake and eat it, too, i.e. no vaccine as well as no \"new normal\" (I always viewed vaccination as the way out of this thing). To kill off the subreddit, I would have removed all of the approved submitters, removed all of the mods (save for the top mod, since I was #2), and put the subreddit in a private status before resigning my own mod position. Instead of going through with that, though, I just washed my hands of the place, unsubscribing from the subreddit and resigning my mod status, leaving everything else intact, i.e. let them wallow in their own mess, but I'm out. I regretted not taking that shot when I had the opportunity, so I'm glad that someone else took that shot behind me, and put an end to that monstrosity of a subreddit.\n\nHowever, I am a bit uneasy about the way that the desired result came about, with the Reddit admins' essentially being bullied into doing it. I would have preferred that the community be banned specifically on its own merits, rather than the way that it actually went down, because it sends a message that these bullying tactics work, which should make every subreddit a little bit nervous, because if they displease the mob, they might be gone soon enough, too.",
