Rich people do this shit all the time. Look at Robert kraft when he was charged for soliciting a prostitute, his lawyers were able to argue that showing the tapes would make the jury think he did it.

I will be doing all I can to help victims of sex trafficking yada yada yada”?\n\nI sort of wonder if he did a low-effort “no I’ve never met her” when his mom asked about it and now he has to stick with it, because there’s no strategy at all to how he’s handled this. Everyone knows he’s guilty now, and it’s completely damaged the royal family as an institution. \n\nHe better pray every night that his mother doesn’t die, because I can’t imagine Charles will be able to do anything but throw him to the wolves.",

Im sure all 27 times(that we know of) Clinton flew on his plane, that was all super innocently explained. Also seems the relationship Epstein and Bill Gates was far more extensive than originally believes.
