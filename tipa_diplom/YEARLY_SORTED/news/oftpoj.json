In fact, the commission‚Äôs chair Thomas Kean and vice chair Lee Hamilton later said in their book ‚ÄúWithout Precedent‚Äù that they considered the questioning of Giuliani to be ‚Äúa low point‚Äù in the commission‚Äôs public hearings. ‚ÄúWe did not ask tough questions, nor did we get all of the information we needed to put on the public record,‚Äù they wrote. They said commission members backed off after drawing criticism in newspaper editorials, which said that the commission had been insensitive to the bravery of police and fire officials during earlier testimony.\"\n\nCitation - FactCheck.org\n\nSpecial thanks to Frommerman for bringing this to the forefront originally.\n\nMy personal thoughts: This must be criticized in a fair and logical manner. \n  Some Fire fighters were off-duty without radios and others operated on a different frequency. Not all firefighters died because of Rudy Giuliani. \nThere's no doubt, lack of new radio equipment, played a role in deaths of some of these hero's.\n  \n  Nevertheless, remember this one statement: They were true hero's. Real hero's listen to their intuition and the cries of those who need help. \n\nWith that being said, I'll ask you this;\n\n \"If you were a firefighter at the horrific 9/11 event, (with a brand new radio) and told to leave the building, as stranded victims cried for help, would you leave them behind?\" \n  \n That's what made them true hero's, in my opinion. Real hero's take the lead. They don't need orders. They do what's right, at the right time, for the right purpose, against all odds. \n (And sometimes that means disregarding a superiors orders.)",
