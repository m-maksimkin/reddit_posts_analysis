With the exception of a few bright lights (Ferrell, Morgan, Thompson) it's been an absolute pile of trash since. Colin Quinn sums it up. \n\nAnd I think on the immediate lead up to it, he was being intentionally unfunny just to spite Lorne. Never read up on it, but I know they were giving him grief even before he got fired. \n\nMan, I just rewatched his standup from March of last year, he does not look good and I didn't even consider he might be ill when I saw it a year ago. Like Robin Williams you just think they're gonna be there, that they're not going any where. Fuck he looks rough in this. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-skA4GhVX7k",

And I was scrolling down the page, the home page, and there’s posts of cats that are fat, and stuff like that. And I scroll down to this post and it says in big letters “comedian Norm McDonald has died”. So I swiped left, which gets you to the other part of reddit, and that’s called the “news” feed...because I wasn’t sure if the “home” feed had any truth to the whole “norm McDonald is dead” post. Lots of silly stuff on that home feed, so you can’t be all that sure, without going to the news feed. So I go to the news feed and the first post, right at the top of the screen, in big letters, it says: “comedian norm McDonald died”....so I knew it was true. The reddit news feed is usually uh..true, as opposed to the “home” feed, which has fat cat posts and fake stuff, you know? And then I looked over and realized that while reading all of this, that I had set my cup of Starbucks coffee that the gf bought me..a rare occasion that I drink that expensive coffee..five dollar coffee you know? I had set my Starbucks coffee cup on the edge of the, those things that hold stuff...table, the table they call it. The bottom of the cup was almost halfway off the table, hanging on and almost falling off you know, but the other half planted on the table. So I almost spilt my coffee. \n\nEdit: True story",
