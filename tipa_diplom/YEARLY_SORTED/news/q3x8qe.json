Girl: \"He took his condom off on purpose!\" Guy: \"No, I did not, it just came off on its own!\" This is governmental intrusion into our bedrooms. Sure, it is heinous for someone to do that, but the potential for even more governmental control over our private lives is worrisome. Do we really want that? Every time a law is put into place, we lose a bit more freedom.\n\n We really need to be mindful of legislating ourselves into a straight jacket, where people are charged with crimes for having bad breath (for example). As for \"spousal rape\" the same rationale applies. It is a slippery slope, and we should be very careful. I am reminded of the scene in Star Wars Ep. III where Padme remarks, as the Galactic Senate cheers Palpatine, that \"This is how freedom dies, to thunderous applause.\" I am only saying the above because there is a potential problem with laws like this of which we really should be mindful. Any guy who rapes his wife, or removes his condom on purpose during sex is a DIRTBAG for sure, and I support trying to put those people in check. All I am saying here is we really need to be careful about laws like this. We need to think it all the way through, and not just have knee-jerk reactions to these issues.",

The concept of male reproductive autonomy is completely unaddressed in law. They have no protection at all. A woman decides she wants to have a baby, deceives the man and he’s on the hook for a child for 18 years no matter what his choice would be. \n\nThis law will be absolutely impossible to police, and if anything, will make it easier for women to commit paternity fraud.",

They’re an individual no matter how much “you’re soulmates and it’s as if you share one beating heart”. If you pressure someone into having sex after they say no then you raped them. That makes you a rapist and sexual predator. The pressure can be psychological and/or physical. Either way, no means no regardless of being married, one a first date, or a complete stranger. \n\nBefore folks try to blast me with the ole’ “but sometimes people say no because they want you to chase” or some other ignorant thought process please understand this, NO MEANS NO. If your partner says no, but by some miracle actually wants you to keep pushing then find another partner. That’s immature and you deserve better. If you’re into bondage or some other form of consensual sexual arrangement in which both or all parties involved have laid out clear rules UNDER NO PRESSURE then this isn’t directed at you. \n\nFor the gaslighters that push the narrative of people falsely claiming to be raped as a norm…..
