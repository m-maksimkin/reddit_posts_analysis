Moderna's vaccine was 92% effective against hospitalization and Pfizer's was 85%.\n\n> But the vaccines' effectiveness against infection dropped sharply in July, when the Delta variant's prevalence in Minnesota had risen to over 70%.\n\n> Moderna was 76% effective against infection, and Pfizer was only 42% effective.\n\n> The study found similar results in other states. For example, in Florida, the risk of infection in July for people fully vaccinated with Moderna was about 60% lower than for people fully vaccinated with Pfizer.\n\n> Why it matters: Although it has yet to be peer-reviewed, the study raises serious questions about both vaccines' long-term effectiveness, particularly Pfizer's.\n\n> It's unclear whether the results signify a reduction in effectiveness over time, a reduced effectiveness against Delta, or a combination of both.\n\n> ‚ÄúBased on the data that we have so far, it is a combination of both factors,\" said Venky Soundararajan, a lead author of the study. \"The Moderna vaccine is likely ‚Äî very likely ‚Äî more effective than the Pfizer vaccine in areas where Delta is the dominant strain, and the Pfizer vaccine appears to have a lower durability of effectiveness.‚Äù\n\n> He added that his team is working on a follow-up study that will try to differentiate between the durability of the two vaccines and their effectiveness against Delta. \n\n> Yes, but: There has been no data so far that has found either vaccine's protection against severe disease and death is significantly less against Delta, and the study notes that there doesn't appear to be much of a difference in complications stemming from breakthrough infections based on which vaccine someone got.\n\nhttps://www.axios.com/coronavirus-vaccines-pfizer-moderna-delta-biden-e9be4bb0-3d10-4f56-8054-5410be357070.html",

Sars-type mRNA vaccines have been heavily funded for a decade because experts believed that Sars would be the cause of the next global pandemic.\n\n> Page 12 of the Pfizer approval letter!\n\nThe specific area being quoted is a section that's saying that the vaccine doesn't need to wait for the continued and future EUA, although any vaccine distributed under EUA needs to have a disclaimer.  It's not saying that the vaccine still only has EUA, and the entire rest of the document confirms this.\n\n>Vaccine mandates are racist!\n\nThis one is my favorite.  It's from an article about how vaccine mandates stand to effect poor PoC more than anyone else.  But that's because poor people can't make time to get the vaccine because they work multiple jobs and rely on their income, and so they can't afford to be knocked out for a day.\n\nAnd people's genuine response to this article was: \"well, if you can't get time off work, you might as well die of preventable disease\" instead of \"those people should get time off\".",
