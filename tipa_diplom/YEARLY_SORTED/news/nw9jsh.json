Even if one would say it is to protect others because they can still get/carry the virus on their person then others should be alright if they wear masks. That being said why get the vaccine if there is little to no benefit from it? I can still get it just as badly and I still am required to wear a mask. Dear God, get your vaccinations (polio, measles, mumps, etc) but I would let the COVID vaccine marinate. Masks promote bacterial growth in mouths, hide our faces/discourage genuine human interactions, and encourage people to touch their face. That last piece is scary. Your body has defense mechanism to deter virus'/bacteria. To those who want to risk it without a vaccine or mask I get it. To those who want the vaccine and mask maybe you have comorbidities, weak immune system, or very young/old. I get it.\n\n     \nThere is valid research for both sides.

As of today, we are nearly 100% compliant with our COVID-19 vaccine mandate with 24,947 of us being fully vaccinated. Houston Methodist is officially the first hospital system in the country to achieve this goal for the benefit of its patients.\n \nYesterday marked the deadline to be fully compliant, and I want to personally thank you and update you on where we stand now. We had only 178 full-time or part-time employees who did not get fully vaccinated or were not granted an exemption or deferral. Of these employees, 27 have received one dose of vaccine, so I am hopeful they will get their second doses soon. Of our employees, 285 received a medical or religious exemption, and 332 were granted deferrals for pregnancy and other reasons. \n \nThe small percentage of employees who did not comply with the policy are now suspended without pay for the next 14 days. We won‚Äôt have the final numbers for two weeks as employees can still get vaccinated with their second dose or with the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. I wish the number could be zero, but unfortunately, a small number of individuals have decided not to put their patients first.\n \nI couldn‚Äôt be prouder of all of you as I know that for some, this was a very difficult decision. I want to personally thank you for choosing to get vaccinated. You did the right thing. You protected our patients, your colleagues, your families, and our community. The science proves that the vaccines are not only safe, but necessary if we are going to turn the corner against COVID-19. The mRNA technology behind the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines isn‚Äôt new or experimental. It‚Äôs been around for many years. With more than 300 million doses distributed in the United States alone, the vaccines have proven to be extremely safe. The number of both positive cases and hospitalizations continue to drop around the country, too, proving the vaccines‚Äô efficacy.\n \nWhile we celebrate this remarkable accomplishment, I know that today may be difficult for some who are sad about losing a colleague who‚Äôs decided to not get vaccinated. We only wish them well and thank them for their past service to our community, and we must respect the decision they made.\n \nSince I announced this mandate in April, Houston Methodist has been challenged by the media, some outspoken employees and even sued. As the first hospital system to mandate COVID-19 vaccines we were prepared for this. The criticism is sometimes the price we pay for leading medicine. As of today, several other major health care centers have followed our lead and have announced their own vaccine mandates, with many more to follow soon.\n \nSeven years ago I introduced the ‚Äúsix words‚Äù into our culture ‚Äì unparalleled safety, quality, service and innovation. At that time, we made the commitment to become the number 1 health care system in the world. You can‚Äôt say you‚Äôre going to be unparalleled and then not be willing to do the things to actually make you unparalleled. Even when those things are difficult.\n \nThis decision was ultimately made for our patients, as they are at the center of everything we do at Houston Methodist. It should bring you great satisfaction to know that your actions will help keep patients as safe as possible when they come to us for care. You have fulfilled your sacred obligation as health care workers, and we couldn‚Äôt ask for more dedicated, caring and talented employees.\n \nThank you.",

            "text": "Just spent a week in Los Angeles (I'm vaccinated) on the way back to Portland OR now. Everyone in LA was wearing masks. As soon as I crossed over the grapevine into the central valley, every stop I made, not even 1/4th of the people were wearing masks. Had a cashier at a huge truck stop (not wearing a mask) say she's not getting vaccinated and she can't wait until the 15th of this month (june) for the mask mandate to be lifted. This shit is never going to end. Welcome to yearly Covid booster shots you'll have to get every October. \n\nGlad they fired those staff. I have family who are in healthcare who didn't (and probably wont get vaccinated). Surprise, surprise,  they got covid 'the old fashioned way'. It blows my mind.",

Please do not be extremely polarized about any idea - especially the vaccine, where we are talking about life and death.\n\nI'm sure many on the \"I'm hesitant about the vaccine\" side would stop and listen if only the people who are \"I'm going to get my jab to protect others and defeat the virus once and for all\" calmly, politely state their reasons. \n\nI know this approach won't work for everyone who is heavily polarized against the vaccine without reason. But if you think you are right, having someone accept why you are right should be way more important - even selfishly - than to yell at others for why you think they are wrong. \n\nAnd if 1 more person can see that getting the vaccine ain't so bad, that's 1 more potential host for the virus removed from this world.\n\nFor once, can we come together as humans rather than be divided?",

FYI - most doctors cannot put an intravenous (IV) line into you. 95% of hospital patients get IV lines where medicines, at least most life saving ones, are administered. For example, if you come to the hospital unconscious you cannot take things by mouth due to risk of aspiration therefore we gotta stick you. Granted there are techs for that but nurses are usually there to do it. Nurses also have knowledge based around that particular field. Sort of how there are specialties for Doctors, an ER nurse is great at emergencies while geriatric nurse will help grandma til her last day. Nurses are great but they are people too. They're scared hell maybe more scared than anyone. They have to go head on to COVID patients. So why not get the vaccine? Maybe they're afraid of that too. Most society is fear based now sadly. Be kind. Or at the very least grateful that there are people who will save your life. If they choose to not get it respect that just as they should respect your decision to get it. I'm sure a lot of you believe in women having a right to their body. In that spirit nurses should too. Also, before anyone says it's different because others lives are at stake just remember that even then it is their decision. You don't have to like it. It's their choice. Just as it is your choice to get your vaccine, wear your mask, and stay away from them/hospitals that allow a choice in vaccinating. Be well and stay safe everyone!",

They said they can't force something that is experimental and not FDA approved.
