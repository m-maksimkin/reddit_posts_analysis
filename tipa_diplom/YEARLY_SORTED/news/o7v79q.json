The police culture does not believe they did anything wrong, and they will not change their policies. This is only a small step towards justice.\n\nLet's consider the alternative universe where no bystanders video taped the conflict. In that case, the municipal police department would see no issue with Chauvin's behavior, as it is in line with their policies.\n\nChauvin's conviction in the legal system is a facade for the reality that he was convicted by the \"court of public opinion.\" One man goes to jail, the system remains the same.",

However, I do believe the judge in this case did give Chauvin the heaftiest of sentences under the guidance of the law. Maximum sentencing would have been thirty years. For a person like myself who has no affiliation to law enforcement etc., I'd most likely receive sentence of 10-- 15 yrs for offense provided record was clean prior. Another LEO from Minnesota was sentence to 12.5 years for the same charge albeit circumstances surrounding that case were immeasurably different. \n\nIt is my personal hope that this be the first big step in justice when concerning the abuses from law enforcement officers (LEO) and that it sets proper precedent nationally.

I am not saying that Chauvin should have been charged with first degree murder. Nor am I saying he should have been sentenced to life in prison on the charges he was convicted of. What I AM saying is that life in prison was not a possible sentence based on the charge he WAS convicted of (second degree murder) by the state of Minnesota.

They want to force society to treat black people better than everybody else. Just like the whites tried to do back then. My black neighbor and I were having a chat about this matter. Long story short, he asked if i supported BLM. I said no, its not fair that they want to be treated better than everybody else because their black. I told him that all lives matter, he got mad and disagreed. I asked him, \"does my life not matter because i happen to be Mexican/American\"? He froze then change the entire subject.

The idea that the court was going to be willing to hand down a slap on the wrist sentence after making a post-conviction factual finding that there were aggravating factors in the case was utterly delusional, and there is no way that a competent defense would take that position unless the client was specifically insisting on it. The most Chauvin could have realistically hoped for was a \"bottom of the box\" sentence at the presumptive minimum of 128 months, and even that would be a significant stretch given the finding of aggravating factors.\n\nMoreover, the only arguments Chauvin's defense was able to make for a sentence below the presumptive range were his age, lack of criminal history, and \"respectful attitude in court\". Previous precedent has explicitly established that below-range sentences are only justified based on \"factors that reflect the seriousness of the offense, not the characteristics of the offender\", which means that without being able to establish \\*any\\* such factor, a below-range sentence would have been overturned on appeal even if the judge granted it at sentencing.",
