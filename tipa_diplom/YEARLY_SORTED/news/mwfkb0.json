There was a whole damn scandal involving the past administration with contracts to \"fix\" the island's infrastructure after Hurricane Maria. Fuckers were pretty much laundering money, hiring companies for what for example would normally be a 20$ job and then proceed to pay them 10,000$ for the job. Google the Whitefish controversy during Maria for a small taste if ya'll have any questions and come to your own conclusions as to what they were trying to do.\n\nAnyone from Puerto Rico without their head in the sand would tell you that giving our government disaster relief or any aid of any kind, is literally giving it to a handful of goons to do with it as they please. Since Maria and the Earthquakes there've been soooo many government officials caught in aid misappropriation and mismanagement, even the capital's ex mayor, devout anti-trumper loved by the MSM was fuckin caught.\n\nI know this is a trump hating sub/site, but many people here cheered when he said that our government was corrupt, because it's the same exact thing we've been saying since time immemorial.",
