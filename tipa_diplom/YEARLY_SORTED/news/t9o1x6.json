Mental and economic slavery.\n\nAgain I think this dude should be in jail ..the situation just an example of how far gone people are..  first the father to even do something so fucking dumb that nothing was accomplished.. not to mention being associated with domestic terrorists basically and then his own kids having to send him to jail.\n\nI know how it is cause my dad isn't much better.. even though I'm not around him much at all the times I am like holidays and stuff I've just chosen to totally remove politics or any talk of anything political from the equation. And other members of the family including him have agreed to adopt it.. \n\nHave to keep family seperate from social media and politics cause they are fucking brainwashed and I have other family that is brainwashed the other direction.\n\nIt's not right to put politics before all this shit.. and it has made our country and society weak as fuck.\n\nIt's good to get some of these people out in the open so they can get put where they belong.\n\nBut extremists are extremists. and extremists elect other extremists.\n\nAnd here we are.",
