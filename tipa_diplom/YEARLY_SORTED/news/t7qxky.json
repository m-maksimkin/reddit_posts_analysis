Appeasement doesn't stop escalating wars for people like Putin. This is history, but it seems nobody paid attention to WWII history in school. Putin will not stop if he succeeds in taking Ukraine because everybody will still be afraid of WWIII. Because of the ties with the west for some of those future countries he plans to invade, he will nuke the US military. This won't be the end of the world because he just has to nuke enough of the US military (carriers, major bases, etc.) so that the US can't stop the Russian military. Because he knows Biden is afraid of WWIII, he believes Biden will not pull the trigger in response to kill innocent Russian civilians. Will we wait until then to stand up to Putin?",
