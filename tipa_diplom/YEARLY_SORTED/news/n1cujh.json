Many uber/lyft drivers either aren't aware or many of the ones who are aware don't wanna pay the extra costs.\n\nThe IRS calculates a mile of driving to cost approx .55 cents, and in my opinion the IRS is pretty close to being right. So in order for Uber to profitable you need to be making at least $1-$1.25 in your pocket.\n\nSo many of the uber drivers I met were on the lower income and they didn't understand they were basically spending more money driving for uber then what uber paid them. Cause they'd see it like this\n\nI spent $30 on gas I made $150 that's a good night over the course of 5 hours.\n\nNo, no you didn't lets break down the costs\n\n* $150: Tax man (self employment tax, state income tax, federal taxes) are going take at least a 1/3, but lets be nice and say 1/4 so thats $37.50\n* $112.50 left\n* You drove 200 miles cost per mile for driving (this includes gas, insurance, upkeep, etc) is approx 45 cents a mile.

When you're an employee of a company the company gets the ability to dictate a lot of the terms of your employment. They can dictate what your schedule is which is a big deal for gig workers who often work small shifts here and there. They can also restrict your ability to work for other companies, as often you're not allowed to work other jobs or work for direct competitors.\n\nWhat, instead, people want to see is the workers get all the benefits being an employee provides with none of the downsides. While I'm all for people making some more money I don't know if I agree with them just straight up winning like that. We shouldn't be screwing businesses because we think they're greedy, heartless bastards. Yes, some companies may have shitty business practices, but we can't just make such a generalized and sweeping claim that business is bad and workers are good.\n\nAlso, keep in mind, these companies are burning money. Walsh is pointing out the companies are making revenue that should be shared to the drivers, but they're not making revenue. Uber has fairly consistently burned $1 billion per quarter and their CEO has claimed he doesn't think they'll ever be profitable. I've heard similar comments from Lyft employees as well.

Meanwhile the ring they're fighting in is second only to NASCAR in terms of aesthetic..\n\nOh, and they also can only fight exclusively with the UFC, not any other MMA organization.\n\nI can't 100% back this up, so take it with with a grain of salt, but I believe they've even stopped fighters from taking fights in other sports, such as kick boxing or ADCC.
