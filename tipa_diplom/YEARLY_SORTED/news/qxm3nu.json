It's the sort of thing that shouldn't have even gone to trial and it's arguable that it violates Rittenhouse's civil rights that it has. The State should have gotten a plea deal from Rittenhouse on the gun charge (plea deals have their own significant problems, but in the case of a misdemeanor without further jail time, it's less problematic).\n\nThe State *knows* they cannot win any of the felony charges in this case. They aren't stupid. The video evidence is insurmountable. They can see Rittenhouse retreat from every single confrontation. They can see him decline to shoot people who raised their hands (including Grosskreutz who was only shot after he pointed his weapon) and only fire when cornered and retreat was no longer a viable option. They know that multiple precedents in caselaw mean they cannot use his age and the legality of the weapon against Rittenhouse's claim of self defense in the shooting-related charges (New York v Goetz, Gammons v Indiana, etc). They know that the initial assailant was a mentally ill man with a history of violent crimes who can be clearly seen pursuing Rittenhouse at running speeds. They know that legally speaking, Huber and Grosskreutz are guilty of assaulting Rittenhouse, since neither of them witnessed Rittenhouse commit a crime and therefore cannot enact a citizen's arrest just on the word of others. They *know* these things. This case is theater, and the only chance of conviction would be in appealing to the emotions of a jury, rather than the facts in evidence.\n\nThe fact that the State has 1: taken a man to trial they know they do not have sufficient evidence to convict, and 2: have misrepresented evidence in both pretrial documents and in their opening arguments, bothers me because sure, Rittenhouse is an idiot, but even idiots should be treated fairly according to the law. Because what happens the next time when the idiot on trial is someone I agree with? I don't want the Rittenhouse trial setting precedents that send innocent people to prison.\n\nThis is a trial born entirely by public demand, and a city afraid of the ramifications of *not* charging him. And that's a pretty gross abuse of power by the State.\n\nThe worst part of this is that there is an FBI plane spying on American Citizens protesting. \n\nThe publicly avaliable footage is an infared video heat source footage but the FBI refused to hand over the crystal clear HD Footage that they say was \"deleted\". \n\nThe type where they can see Afghan terrorist loading bombs(water) into the trunk of a car and see the people in super high detail. The entire incident was filmed thanks to a bunch of rioters bashing up and setting cars on cire the the car lot and happen to film the scene of the first shooting with Kyle and Rosenbaum.\n\n\"The FBI footage was shown to the jury during the testimony of one of the agents who captured the footage with the drone, FBI agent Brandon Craimin. However, the FBI allegedly testified, in private, that they were in possession of another version of the video in HD that they did not supply the members of the defense, according to Human Events. When asked for a copy of the tape, the FBI allegedly denied the defense’s request, saying that the video no longer existed, according to the report\".\n\nThis is yet another example of how the case could be thrown out. Nothing gets deleted with the FBI. Everything is logged somewhere, backed up to cloud, to another physical location and then probably again encrypted 10 ways.",

I can't think of a more toxic gun culture in the first world than in here. An elementary school was shot up where 20 children were killed, and nothing outside of its state changed. The gun homicide rate is higher than some of Central and South America, let alone much higher than anywhere in Europe. The only country where more people per capita kill themselves with guns is Greenland. And because of the political divide on guns, not only did the prosecution try to charge him with something he shouldn't have been charged with, but Rittenhouse is likely to become the face of *further* deregulation for years to come.\n\nYou need a license to drive any vehicle bigger and more powerful than a scooter everywhere in the country, as well as registration for whatever you drive. But half of the country thinks there should be no accountability or requirements needed to own and freely operate machines specifically designed to kill and maim people at peak efficiency.\n\nJust because Rittenhouse was rightfully not guilty of first-degree murder doesn't mean the factors that emboldened a teenager to go out into the streets with a rifle he needed no requirements to legally use should be ignored. Vigilantism being glorified combined with guns not being taken seriously led to this, and it's going to keep happening with no changes. And if you want more deaths in the streets, no matter what side you're on, you're part of the problem.",

Would he have actually done anything if he wasn't attacked? I'm not so sure. But I do think he went to that event intent on harming people with a different political stance than him. I think faced with real people, he relented on his intentions. Then was unfortunately attacked.\n\nBut legally we really can't prove he had intent to harm anyone. Even if the Judge had allowed them to enter his online posts about wanting to shoot protestors I dont think there was enough evidence to prove intent. Only Kyle really knows for sure what went through his mind when he went there with a gun he had no right to have in his possession.\n\nWith all that said, I do believe he was innocent in the eyes of the law. He was clearly defending himself. Did he get what he wanted? To kill protestors? Hard to say. But he was innocent of murdering those people. He didn't start that fight and he was just defending himself. We can't persecute people for thought crimes.\n\nI dont believe for one second he went there with that gun with anything other than malicious intentions. But thats just my belief. When presented with all the evidence, I would have voted innocent. Because ultimately he was innocent. Of that engagement. I dont think he's completely innocent, morally. But legally, he was. And quite frankly the law cannot act as God. It can only act on facts and evidence. Not personal feelings or beliefs.\n\nUltimately what did happen he was innocent of. And the prosecution, the Judge, the media, and both the right and the left turned this into a ridiculous fucking circus. The Judge by not letting them call the dead \"victims\" or bringing Kyles internet records into evidence making him seem biased before the evidence was even given. The prosecution for a million reasons. The media and the partisan hacks all using this as their next vote whipping tool.\n\nJust a fucking shit show.",

That said regardless of how I feel about him on a personal level, the law is the law and if we just imprison people because we don't agree with their (albeit wrong imo) view of the world what's the point of having laws and trials in the first place. There has to be a standard. Being a terrible human being doesn't and shouldn't remove your rights, as much as sometimes I wish it would lol.\n\nThe course of action for anyone here who is genuinely upset at the outcome would be to work towards introducing laws that could prevent your undesired outcome for the future. Even if we don't agree politically i encourage people to do so. Get involved, vote, and petition your state. Its good for the country.\n\nI support our 2nd amendment rights 100%, but I would personally like to see more regulation as to what can be brought out in a public place as open carry especially in a high tense situation such as a emotion fueled protest/riot.\n\nNot that I believe an AR15 Is a dangerous weapon anymore than any other long rifle, handgun or shotgun (because it's not). It's more about the reaction and lack of education on rifles of this nature that can spark fear, and therefore irrational behavior ( thinking it's an \"automatic assault rifle\" etc) in people, especially crowds.\n\nSay for instance, Kyle had a concealed weapons permit and a holstered handgun I don't believe people would have been enticed to attack him, and he still would have been able to protect himself if the need arises. He obviously broke no laws in doing so, despite how you may or may not feel about that law.\n\nIf we had proper legislation for instance that open carry long rifles can only be used in public at sanctioned events etc maybe things would be different here. Though this is very much an opinion of mine and not a fact, and there would be so many semantics revolving around what is considered an okay event, and im sure many would oppose blindy due to Mah freedoms irrationally. But i feel like it would be a good place to start.\n\nInteresting case though none the less. Kyle wouldn't be allowed a seat at my dinner table, but he didn't belong in prison either, anyone glorifying him to be some big hero is lost in the sauce of political football team mentality and needs to wake up and start using your head. Hopefully this is  big wake up call that legal or not sometimes your actions have reactions and you need to use your fucking head before he ends up going down a dangerous path in the future.",

I am a strong supporter of self defense laws and my fear was that if Rittenhouse were found guilty, lawyers could later cite this case and bring charges against other people that were rightfully standing their ground.\n\nRegardless, anybody that applauds Kyle’s actions and celebrates his use of deadly force is a fucking ignoramus, pure and simple. I find it fascinating how so many members of the “pro-life” party are celebrating a kid who killed two people and seriously wounded another. Pathetic hypocrites.",

            "text": "Ok, thank god I didn't watch any of this shit. The media has been getting worse and worse and it's hard to know any of the truth these days so I'm going to sum up the best talking points from both sides of the aisle.\n\n I think personally that guns escalate situations and that having a gun in any situation makes the chance of someone getting shot go from 0 percent to above 0 percent. It's a talking point I bring up quite often whenever I think about guns in America and it's why I want to leave this country because having twice as many guns as people doesn't bode well for us.\n\nA 17 year old having a gun and bringing it to a situation he may have to use it in is sketchy and very believable. According to the people who want Kyle not guilty, and I believe it to be more, he used it for self defense and there's video proof, so the trial is already over right? America believes in self defense based cases no matter what. A common story we haven't been able to talk about is how quickly self defense becomes offense. In this case, because of the situation that America is in, Kyle Rittenhouse is not guilty. \nBut this happening at all is chilling. \nWhat happens when there's no video proof?\nWhat does it mean for a kid to carry a gun to a dangerous scene and shoot someone for the future of our conflicts?\nI believe that guns are shit, we know that people's adrenaline spikes while holding a gun. \n\nI also know that I wouldn't trust roughly half of America to drive a car myself included and we do it all the time, and those aren't even designed to kill people, it's the third highest cause of death in America. When we get to the protests where people are heavily enraged and incensed at each other and everyone is armed because of situations like this one, what's going to happen? A war?\nA shootout? Everyone has heard of false flag operations and at some point it doesn't really matter who starts it- if everyone is armed to the teeth and on edge, it's a powder keg waiting to happen.\n\nPeople are focusing very hard on whether he's guilty or not but we should be stepping back from the case and asking about what the consequences of the results, the action that happened at all, and the causes of the scenario.\nNow some people think that the two in the video who attacked kyle rittenhouse were pedos or something I have no idea, I don't really care- people deserve to live and have second chances in our society and we need to make our prison systems help and teach the less fortunate instead of punish them and twist them up even further.\n\nFor Kyle, glad you're not guilty. I doubt you'll ever be a part of anything this dangerous again after all the abuse that being a part of this has been.\nFor our system, we're in trouble. If we're at the point of name calling the dead to defend the living in a highly escalatory situation involving issues that are far bigger then just the right to bear arms even- being poor or trodden upon by debt or the state or the fact that non-violent protesting leads to little change, or the fact that both sides are frothing at the mouth so hard that it could become a battlefield quickly...\n\nI see more arms at protests in the future- even if that's a bad idea!\nI see more deaths from shootings at protests violent and non violent in the future.\nWe know cops are stirring up trouble among non-violent protests so they can opress people. What will it mean when theres guns involved?\n\nIf you live in America, ask yourself, how do we stop this trainwreck from getting even worse. Because I guaruntee namecalling, ignoring truths about the situation you don't like, like the fact that kyle was 17, or the fact that he was attacked before he shot, or the fact that he brought a gun with him, or the fact that the police were clearly not handling this situation, or the fact that people were at a violent peak and trying to fight and kill each other, or how about the fact that the media did a very bad job painting this picture, or how about the fact that there's a lot of shooting stories that are more murky than this one that still ended in favor of the shooter, I can go on and on, but the truth is, there is no black and white. There is cause and effect, and we're being taken for a ride.",

As the details played out in court I started to feel more and more that while I felt Kyle was an idiot who provoked a situation, I do think he is legally in the right to defend himself even if I bemoan a country where guns are so readily available. He may have wanted to go there to posture and play soldier but ultimately the violence falls on those who engaged him.\n\nTo me the greatest injustice in this case is that it was a case at all: had Kyle been anything but a mayo-commando, there would be no trial. He would have been gunned down at the scene by police. I think he's technically innocent but his ability to get that proven in a court of law is privelege not evenly distributed.

He was allowed to own the gun, carry it, use it to defend his own life when attacked.\n\nThe only remaining viable argument against Rittenhouse is \"Well, he shouldn't have \\*been there\\*\", and while that is an argument from wisdom, it's not legally true:  He had every right to be there, and to be armed.  \n\nQuite honestly, his attackers had the same right to be there and to be armed, but they did not have the right to destroy property, or to violently attack anyone else.  That's where they went wrong.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat \\*is\\* controversial is why the DA Binger was so hell-bent on bringing these charges, prosecuting them, and engaging in misconduct to do so.  \n\nWhy did he withhold usable video evidence from the defense?\n\nWhy did he [allow the Khindri brothers to lie on the stand about their involvement and approval of Rittenhouse et al being there defending their property](https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/megan-fox/2021/11/19/suborning-perjury-video-evidence-suggests-car-lot-owners-lied-on-the-stand-what-did-da-binger-know-and-when-did-he-know-it-n1534516)?  \n\nThese are the kind of things that cause prosecutors to lose their jobs and be disbarred.",

I think what we need to take away from this trial is that: it is stupid to walk around public spaces while brandishing a weapon essentially, it causes everyone to be on edge, raises the chances of confrontation and helps nobody in anyway. This is the problem. Rittenhouse is guilty of one thing, being a moron. No rational person thinks it’s a good idea to walk around populated public space while holding a weapon. This is what needs to change, the law is correct on the verdict but the defendant is just part of a class of fucking morons that exist and think this is ok.\nGuns are for hunting, shooting ranges and defending your homes when it comes to civilian usage, they in no way should be held in public space because it’s a fact that it causes people to be extremely uncomfortable. Carrying a firearm on display in public is like yelling “bomb” on an airplane. Sure the person doing it knows that they aren’t a threat but everyone else has to guess and try to trust that you aren’t a threat and that’s a problem.",

That's what guns are for, after all.  \n\nSo, obviously from Trayvon Martin's perspective, he was also being stalked by someone who seemed intent on hurting him, to the point that he felt the need to turn and confront the man.  Except In Trayvon's case, he didn't have a gun for self-defense.  \n\nSo, I'd like to ask Rittenhouse supporters, what they think should have been the verdict, if Trayvon Martin had turned around and shot Zimmerman \"in self defense\", just like Kyle did?  Or if they felt that Zimmerman should be considered the hostile aggressor, for going after Trayvon Martin in the first place, like Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber did?  \n\nDid Trayvon Martin have the right to defend himself, just like Kyle?  And how did you feel about Zimmerman getting a pass, for killing a kid, who was only trying to defend himself?  Do you support a persons right to \"self-defense\", only for the folks with guns...or do you just automatically support whoever happens to survive the confrontation?",

Huber might have thought he does something good when trying to stop Rittenhouse. This is the perfect reason why it makes sense to have official uniforms and mandates like police has.

Its a pretty clear case of self defence.\n\nI am fairly certain that every US Gun Safety instructor would tell you not to let someone take your gun away from you in that situation, because he is very likely going to use it to kill you.\n\nI've done military service and yea, its pretty much common sense that you dont just run up to someone with a gun and try to take it away from them, because you are probably going to get shot. Nor do you allow someone to take your gun away from you unless they are someone like a police officer.\n\nI can tell you that everyone i know in the military would go \"wow, what a moron\" if someone got shot because he was trying to take someone's gun away from them (especially if he had made a death threat previously).",

Anyone saying this trial only happened because of politics are brain dead. \n\n2. I think this case was not a fair trial regardless of if Rittenhouse is guilty or not. The judge was frankly overly sympathetic to Rittenhouse and not an impartial judge. The prosecution was bad on such a level I have to wonder if it was set up to lose on purpose. \n\n3. Regardless of whether Rittenhouse was legally justified in using self-defense, the result of this trial will embolden right wing extremists to go to protests with weapons and shoot at protestors, then claim self defense. There has already been a trend of shootings and general violence directed at protestors/counterprotestors before this and this is going to make it worse. Obviously this shouldn't have an impact on what the jurors decided, but I think this is going to be the result.",

This is not unique in anti-government social media circles, including many pro 2A. \n\nI am speculating about this next part because I don't know what Rittenhouse does online, but I would not be the least bit surprised that Rittenhouse was more than familiar with the letter of the law in WI regarding self-defense through private online communities. So yes, Rittenhouse put himself in a situation where he had no business, yes he brought a weapon the should not have had, and yes he caused the situations where he had to \"defend himself\". \n\nBut what can you prove in a court of law? Unless there's more out there to prove he was the aggressor, in court, he can lean on the definitions of \"self-defense\" and say \"that's what I did\". He won't be the first.

Minor in possession of a gun illegally (thrown out by the judge over a nitpick reading the law regarding dimensions of the weapon, not regarding the substance of the charge, or intent of the law, but let off by technicality.)\n2. 15 days Prior Kyle says on video \"I wish I had my AR so I could shoot these people\" outside of a CVS. (that shows extreme lack of judgement and a pattern of immature behavior not befitting the respect due a deadly weapon, and this behavior continues per video evidence up until the incident, including video of him pointing his firearm at others.)\n3. When asked by the prosecution \"why an AR-15?\" Its because Kyle admitted he knew that having a pistol would be illegal for him to posses, and to quote Kyle \"the AR 15 looked cool.\" (he knew in advance that what he was doing was in a legal grey area at best.)\n4. When asked by prosecution \"would you agree that you are not allowed to kill people in response to the destruction of another person's property, Kyle agreed with the prosecution. (Again, Kyle demonstrates that he knows he was in a legal grey area)\n\nIt is beyond question, 2 people are dead, and one is maimed because of A CHILD enabled by morons. The kid's parents are fucking garbage.\n\nSo many Conservatives are taking this as a win for themselves, and its ridiculous and infuriating that they are this stupid.\n\nIf you are a pro 2A advocate, dedicated to the right of American citizens to arm themselves for defense, even if you feel the Jury was just in absolving Kyle on grounds of self defense, this looks so bad for your position, because it just is.\n\nKyle was not a hero, but a stupid immature child.\n\n A child was taken (by an irresponsible parent) to the site of a known riot/protest that had been going for weeks at that point, to defend SOMEONE ELSES property, with a gun that was not even his, when a curfew was at least verbally established by police several days running. \n\nThe protesters had a dumpster on fire and on video were pushing it TOWARDS a gas station! That is the epitome of dumbass reckless behavior, regardless of circumstances. NOBODY was in the right in this situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEven without the hostile environment, any responsible gun owner would know, you never go into a potentially hostile or dangerous situation with a gun that you do not own that is untested. \n\nPeople on the right are so thrilled that he got off, that they just forget that this could have easily ended with Kyle dead if his weapon had not functioned, or if any of his victims had succeeded in subduing him. He very well could have died himself, as well as those who he murdered.\n\nHe could have been justifiably shot earlier per video of him aiming his AR at others too.\n\nI think in the case of RosenBaum, it was possible to state self defense due to him trying to grab the gun, and the sound of gunfire behind. \n\nIn the case of the others (who assumed he was an active shooter,) that seems grey.\n\nThis whole trial is a poster titled \"Why kids should not have guns,\" even if you feel Kyle was justified in self defense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIts not a question. A child murdered two people. He demonstrated with prior actions, and knowledge, extreme negligence, and he didn't even get a misdemeanor charge?\n\nIts an insane case, whether you agreed with the verdict or not. \n\nTreating this kid as a hero on the right, is going to do immeasurable damage to public good and sets horrible precedent.",

Of course, she couldn't tell me anything until after the conclusion. But it wore on her as a jury member. She would come home, eat dinner, cry and dread returning because both lawyers were nasty. They should bring back court TV for that. Judges are less likely to get deeply involved because they don't want the publicity. He actually might cry and there will be no recess so he can compose himself. Plus, the jury is less likely to be sympathetic because it's just money. My wife was on a criminal trial a couple of years ago and the deliberations were much stressful because the guy was looking at life without parole which is what he ended up with but it took a lot longer for the jury to decide on his crimes. \n\n\nThese deviants tend to fuck up again.

So yes obviously don’t rush the guy with the weapon, but what if the armed guy continue to instigate? There’s no way to deescalate with him unless you also have a weapon.

People may riot, more may get hurt or killed and it's the prosecutors fault for even bringing charges in a clear cut case of self defense. It will be in text books, and discussed in universities.",

Personally I think the prosecution violated not only court conduct, not only procedural law, but went as far as to question Mr. Rittenhouse’s constitutional rights. The judge nearly called a mistrial from what I understand, and there were multiple attempts to intimidate, dox, or otherwise threaten the jurors. There have been protests outside the court constantly, they were followed by an MSNBC journalist who ran a red light to try and keep up with the jury transport. Thank god for that judge, thank god for those jurors, thank god for the defense, and thank god for common sense. I mean that as an expression, so don’t think I’m a zealot that thinks The Hand of God intervened. If this trial had gone another way, if he’d been found guilty of what he was charged with, then none of us could ever defend ourselves against our attackers ever again, for even if we succeed, even if we survive, those assailants that tried to kill you will now try and spin the story around, make themselves the victim and not the perpetrator. Remember this case, dear friends. Remember what it means to fight for your life, your liberty, and the betterment of all. Did those rioters in Kenosha have betterment in mind when they were burning down the city? Absolutely not. They wanted chaos, disorder, destruction of our good but flawed society. Kyle went there to help, he went there to prevent further death and destruction, and he was nearly killed for it. Then he’s nearly thrown into jail just for refusing to go down without a fight. Bless you all, unless you’ve thrown a Molotov through a business window. In that case, I hope you remember the fire. That’s what awaits you. Not a threat, a promise.

I traded him fake acid for his mom’s bottle of Percocet but I ended up struggling with opiate addiction for years so I guess jokes on me on that one. After high school, he killed an old man with his car and his parents went broke keeping him out of jail because he wasn’t the jail type.

The common public (at least under 50 crowd) support the notion that playing violent video games do not lead to violence. Also, the victims didnt shoot a gun at Rittenhouse. This would be well known information upon which we would support his defense as actual self-defense. Did not the video capture the details or were parts conveniently deleted/subtracted? When the prosecutor is trying to give the defendant a buy out through BS info and lead interrogatories that a jury would find biased as to support the defendant, you know it was rigged. Obviously, the police never wanted to press charges against what they hailed as their own (youth trainee). They saw themselves: Jack^^^ bully with no brains and a machine gun excited to kill. This is a lesson to the public that the police have immeasurable power and input in the trial process: he was granted bond with no tether and affordable bail on 2 MURDER CHARGES! I faced a 2 year misdemeanor charge for a crime I did not commit yet was forced to pay $50,000 cash/surety after which was raised to $125,000 after my attorney got into an argument with the judge about me not being able to afford bond. I couldn't afford it and after 8 months of mental and physical deterioration, I was forced to take a plea deal despite my innocence so that I could finally grasp the concept and reality that the world still existed. My mind had deteriorated so severely being locked away for the first time for so long that I began to lose grasp that a world still existed beyond jail since I felt I was never getting out. He deserved to face this hell, not me. It severely riles me up. I can also think about all the other people sitting in jail and prison right now innocent and even factually circumstantial innocent yet they have to face seeing a clearly guilty double murderer get off free simply because the police supported his position to take out black people ('violent deviant criminals' in the minds of police). This is why the police need to be abolished. The community can do well to police themselves, not a mafia monster gang controlling who gets convicted by being forced to stay in jail while waiting trial (pretrial factors) and how the prosecution presents the case.",

I dont think it was the right decision, as I stated elsewhere: \n\nHis decision to go there, with the rifle, was a bad decision. He knew full well what could happen if he did that, and it did happen. He lied about being an EMT, he lied about going to give first aide. And he posted online a (week?) before saying that he was going to start something IIRC. He knew his presence would cause drama there. He wanted to be seen as a hero, he went looking for something to happen. \n\nThat's my opinion. Legally, they didn't see it that way.

He was just a scared kid who was being attacked, and even if he probably shouldn't have gone he had every legal right to be there. I'm sure his family will be happy to hqve him back and he deserves his freedom. Thoughts and prayers go out to the jurors and Kenosha now, hopefully there will be no violence.",

I haven’t watched the trial at all so I won’t speak on what I don’t know. But why does killing people make him a hero? If he saved lives then sure. But if it was self defense then the only person who should be considering him a hero is MAYBE himself, and even then I’d think it was too much. \n\n\n“Oh but he got attacked by pedophiles” \n\n\nOk but YOU personally didn’t. He’s still not a hero. You don’t know if he stopped others from dying. He probably didn’t. Remember kids, if you killed Hitler when he was a baby, you’d be a killer of an innocent baby. You’re all (me included) human beings and you’re all (me definitely included) dumb as shit when it comes to predicting the future so don’t go fishing into alternate timelines just to glorify a teenager who appears to have wandered into a riot looking for trouble. \n\n\nAmericans as a whole seem to love going where they don’t belong, and when they get attacked they just kill.

One of the members of the mob catches up to him and slaps his head, knocking off his hat. This is the first act of violence in the video, but it is minor enough that Kyle can continue trying to run away. Then he trips. Several assailants advance on him, and he fires only the necessary amount shots to keep them at bay.

We've all been looking at the details of the individuals but let's take a slightly broader view because it's important to look at how systems influence individual decisions.  \nThe ones \\*most\\* at fault for the entire situation were Kenosha's law enforcement.  \nThey knew the vigilantes were there, armed and agitated and ready. They were breaking curfew just like the protesters were. Rather than ask them to disperse like they were telling the protesters to do, rather than pelting them with tear gas canisters or rubber bullets, they offered them waters and thanked them for being there. Right there right off the bat, they're holding them to a separate standard.  \nWhen law enforcement used barricades to direct where the protesters were marching, they pushed them directly towards where the vigilantes, now empowered from the police response to their presence, were waiting.  \nThey could have and should have kept the two groups separated by directing them down a different street but they chose to throw gasoline on the fire by pushing them together. It's no wonder the situation resulted in violence.  \nRegardless of how any of us feel about self-defense or whether Rittenhouse was justified or anything else, I think it's important to acknowledge what an absolute failure this was on law enforcement's part. They should have been trying to de-escalate the situation, not provoke it, and maybe nobody would have had to die that night.",

Yes, his actions were legally justified, but if all of this was in the name of self defense, the best self defense would have been to stay away, and that goes for all parties involved.\n\nNo one made smart decisions that night in Kenosha, and no one should be celebrated for their role in any of it.\n\nAt the end of the day, the law was upheld as it should be, and that is a good thing; but it is up to us to determine what was morally right and wrong, and to criticize it where it is due, and towards everyone involved.",

Kyle was guilty of alot of things, and got away with it. What will that say to alot of people who will now do the same because Kyle got away with it.

            "text": "Legally, I'm not surprised. Was it self defense? Yes. Was the action of self defense disproportionate to the danger he faced? In the first two shootings, absolutely. The first guy threw a plastic a bag and charged towards him, while the second hit him with a skateboard and tried to snatch the rifle away. The third shooting, a bit paradoxically knowing the guy pointed a gun at him but got away with minor injuries, IMO was justified. As I understand, US law doesn't see it this way. Self defense is self defense, regardless of the severity of the attack. I live in Europe, and in my country legally the level of self defense must be proportional to the level of threat you face. So, you cannot stab or shoot someone if he's attacking you with let's say fists, which in my opinion is fair in most instances. On the other hand, as an European, I'm truly shocked with what is socially and legally acceptable in the US. A untrained 17 year old carrying an AR in plain sight and acting as a vigilante sort of protecting the community. That's crazyyyyy. I saw the New York Times footage and apparently in Kyle's group there was an ex military service man, who's goal that night was the same as Kyle's, but unlike him he showcased patience, knowledge and composure throughout the night, which consequently resulted in no issues from his side. A hormone packed kid with no formal training trying to play the hero role same way as a well experienced soldier, is a recipe for disaster. To conclude, what happened happened, we cannot revert the past. Right now, I see Kyle as a clueless kid, who as kids often do had poor judgement in a crucial moment. I'm indifferent towards him as of now. However, if he in the near future goes the George Zimmerman route of portraying himself as a right wing hero and cashing in on a tragic event, I'll have zero empathy for him and as a matter of fact I'll hate his guts. Unfortunately, the last mentioned scenario seems very likely to me, knowing the support he gained from the conservative movement.",

It is legal for the non-rioter to have a gun. And it is legal for the non-rioter to defend their lives if attacked. Prosecutors were advocating some dystopian hellscape where if you arent a rioter and find yourself attacked my rioters your duty is to lay down and die.\n\nPracticing your 2nd amendment rights is not a provocation or incitement to violence. You dont lose your rights because you crossed state lines or played call of duty.\n\nThe prosecution here was a joke - not just  incompetent but ignoring rules, repeatedly,  with holding evidence from the defense and lying about it, trying to get witnesses to change their story and lie about it, and advancing the most awful and insidious and anti-American ideas.\n\nThen of course MSNBC gets in on the act and tries to harass, doxx, and intimidate jurors (some of whom apparently were genuinely intimidated)\n\nThis whole situation has been an embarrassment and scandal and I can safely say Kyle was the most reasonably behave person in the entire mess.\n\nIt really makes it seem like our justice system is barely functioning.",

Rittenhouse was not violating any laws by being where he was that night (except curfew, which should have applied equally to the people he shot).\n2.

However, he and his armed group should not have assigned themselves the duty to protect the neighborhood as justification to carry weapons into that situation.  These are not people standing guard appointed with authority as police or military.  This is not their job, nor their choice to appoint themselves.  I see this is very socially dangerous.  It influenced official police attempts to control the situation and ultimately resulted in chaos, conflict, and death.  There are many people who want Kyle arrested and jailed.  While I think his actions were disgusting and shameful, I don’t think he should be incarcerated because his crime was in self defense.  The justice system did not cave to media pressure, so this is a win for American justice.\n\nI hear people promote their actions as patriots or an American duty, and this is where I see a loss for America.  These people who took it upon themselves to act as guards were not protecting their homes or their lives.  They knew their show of weapons would create conflict.  This does not ethically justify killing someone.  This is childish behavior resulting in death - tragedy.  Shameful.  For these people to receive praise or be viewed as patriots or model Americans is shameful.  This event is an example of how self vindication and saying “me vs them” is dangerous.  I still believe America is better than this.  But to say “not guilty” justifies Kyle’s actions, or to fail to acknowledge this event as a tragedy, is a loss for America.",

However the Justice system wanted to make an example out of him and failed to act in a reasonable and just manner.\n\nI don't support killing of any kind, Rittenhouse's actions outside of court were reprehensible, however that doesn't change the fact that he is now \"innocent\" in the eyes of the law. \n\nHopefully the American justice system doesn't make this case into a precedent and conducts itself responsibly in the future.",

The hunting criteria was considered confusing and was not considered. All other criteria were met.**\n\nState law says, \"Possession of a dangerous weapon by a person under 18...applies only to a person under 18 years of age who possesses or is armed with a rifle or a shotgun if the person is in violation of [[short barreled rifle or shotgun  provision](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/941/iii/28)] or is not in compliance with [[hunting license provision](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/29/iv/304)]\" ([Source](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/948/60))\n\nThe hunting provision discusses restrictions for 12-16 year olds. In this case, Rittenhouse was 17. The judge found the hunting clause to be confusing and only considered the short barreled portion. According to PBS, \"When a law is so confusing, legal doctrine calls for judges to interpret it in favor of defendants\". ([Source](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/explainer-why-did-the-judge-drop-kyle-rittenhouse-gun-charge))\n\nThe rifle was not found to be short barreled.\n\n If he had been convicted of this charge, Rittenhouse would have been guilty of a class A misdemeanor. The penalty for which is, \"a fine not to exceed $10,000 or imprisonment not to exceed 9 months, or both\". ([Source](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/statutes/statutes/939/iv/51))",

I am tired of repeating myself so here goes.\n\n**But let's start with carrying a gun.**\n\nOkay, if you can legally carry, go for it if you want. Just keep in mind gun safety and local laws so you don't hurt anyone by accident or commit a crime.\n\n**Regarding self-defence:**\n\nFor self-defense to be legal, there are some general requirements that need to be fulfilled. In addition to state specific requirements such as duty to retreat, etc.\n\n\n1. Subjective fear of death or grave bodily injury. What this means is that you honestly need to fear for your life. This is your subjective feeling. \n\n2. Objective fear of death or grave bodily injury. What this means is that the threat actually needs to be dangerous in reality. For example, if I am deathly scared of snow, and a 6 year old girl throws a snowball at me, I might be *subjectively* terrified for my life, but *objectively* the 6 year old child pose no danger.\n\n3. Provocation. If you are found to be provoking an attack just to have a chance to use deadly force, then you might lose your right to self-defence. This is what the Rittenhouse prosecutors were arguing. See your local state laws for specifics. \n\n4. If the other person retreats, then you are no longer under objective fear of death or grave bodily injury (2) so you can no longer use deadly force. This means that even if the other person has just committed a heinous crime, using violence against a fleeing perpetrator is on very shake grounds. \n\n5. If the person retreats and you pursue, now you might become the legal aggressor and the person you pursue might become the victim. In which case the person you pursue might regain the right to self-defense, while you lose any justification (see point 4).\n\nSee your state laws for specifics and talk to a lawyer for specifics. \n\n**This case is not a legal precedent that allows anyone to shoot anyone else without reasonable self-defence justification.**",

The media outlets will almost certainly be sued and the plaintiff is likely to win. Many of the people who are incensed with the verdict likely didn’t watch the videos or didn’t understand the law. \n\nThe lesson here for all as it was with the Nick Sandman case is wait for judgment until the facts are known. The media will likely have to pay millions in settlement as they should as Kyle Rittenhouse was clearly defamed. The media will hopefully learn their lesson and be more professional the next time something controversial happens!

But let’s set the record straight. \n\nTony Evers, the Governor of Wisconsin failed to do his job and send enough force to Kenosha to help control these riots and protests. The police force, knew what they had wasn’t enough and took help from a militia.\n\nThe kid was being attacked in the protests, and when the idiots started swarming him and attacked him. He shot ‘em. Yes, it was self defense and that was proved in the courts. He wasn’t a blood hungry maniac just shooting people like some people wanna say. Otherwise why wasn’t he shooting at anyone else? It was stupid to have the kid be put in that situation, but just as stupid to try and run up on someone with a gun. The prosecution couldn’t prove that it wasn’t self defense, so the kid walks. End of story. \n\nBottom line, this starts from the damn top. Tony Evers dropped the ball getting the help he needed out there and then that happened. He sent 500 National guards to Kenosha when the case concluded. But why not before then Tony boy? Hopefully you learned your lesson after the Kenosha protests remained peaceful this time around.",
