Betty outlived all of her costars on that show and all of her costars on several other shows also. She outlived her husband, and when asked what made her choose to never remarry after he passed away from cancer she said, \"once you've had the best, there is no point in trying for anything better.\" Most people would maybe be depressed about all of the loss a person goes thru when they outlive everyone they've worked with and loved, but instead the internet welcomed her into it's good graces and there are very few people that the internet completely agrees on, Dolly Parton is one of them, and Betty White is another. Online communities gave her a resurgence of traffic so large that she was the oldest person ever to host SNL based on the internet demanding it. I'm glad that we wasted on those likes and comments on the likes of her. I for one am immensely happy that she was recognized in that way. Rip Betty ‚ù§Ô∏è",
