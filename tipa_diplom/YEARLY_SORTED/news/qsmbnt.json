I remember when the crazy was unfolding and there wasn‚Äôt outrage or concern for her welfare. There was enjoyment watching the unraveling of someone, as paparazzi continued to tug at the loose strings. \n\nI hope after all of this, there isn‚Äôt a major return to paparazzi hounding her and if there is, I am very hopeful that we do not consume and enjoy the content but rather refuse to engage with it so that there isn‚Äôt an incentive to continue bothering her. \n\nI hope these same principles apply in the future to others as well. It wasn‚Äôt right what anybody did to her, whether close to her or simply enjoying her unraveling from the comfort of their living room.",
