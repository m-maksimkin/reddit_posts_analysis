Both parties have been pushing neoliberalism, a rightwing economic & political ideology that benefits the rich and hurts the working class for decades (since Regan was in office)!\n\nThey don't give a fuck about us working stiffs. They get your vote and then they go back to serving the rich and big business.\n\nThey don't give a fuck about you unless you're a rich donor!\n\nHow can you allow yourself to be brainwashed by their propaganda?!?\n\nDo you not see what legislation they actually pass in the country? Do you see what gets scrapped? Why do the rich and big corporations pay so little taxes?\n\nWhy is there so much corporate greed in America? Why do workers not have as many rights as workers in other OCED nations?\n\nWhy does white collar crime never really get prosecuted at a high rate? Why so many tax loop holes for the mega rich?\n\nWhy is the SEC underfunded and toothless?!?\n\nWhy are prisoners forced to work? \n\n\nWhy does the IRA focus on the middle class so much and not go after the rich? \n\nAmerica, the richest country in the history of the world yet the only OCED nation in which there are zero federally mandated paid vacation days, zero federally mandated paid sick days and zero federally mandated paid maternity/paternity leave. Only OCED nation with no public universal healthcare (just tie your health insurance to employment, get back to work wage slaves). America #1 in the world in medical debt. America, the most expensive postsecondary tuition in the world. America the most free country on Earth yet it has 25% of the global incarcerated population.\n\nTHE DEMOCRATS AND THE REPUBLICANS DO NOT GIVE A FUCK ABOUT THE WORKING CLASS!\n\n\nneoliberalism explained here: https://youtu.be/oWOH9iJhZXo",

If you **really** want to empathize with the assessors, you can imagine their thinking. “House values haven’t really come down that much,” they would have thought. ‘’This is just the Lehman crisis. And Michigan law only lets property tax assessments rise by a point or two a year. So, if I drop the assessment the way I’m supposed to, the tax rate stays too low forever and the city can’t pay its bills.”  \n  \nBut, even if that all seems reasonable…wouldn’t the next thing you do as the city and county be to put a moratorium on foreclosures?

There are blocks and blocks of abandoned homes here, some of them in deplorable condition, that are frequently seized by the city to be auctioned off by the \"land bank\".However the corruption runs so deep...my neighbor across the street does not reside in his home. He does maintain the lawn and the structure, the only indication that the home is not occupied are the metal covers over the windows and doors to protect the home from being molested or otherwise abused by passersby and members of the community with nefarious intent. People will go into unoccupied homes and steal the windows, doors, furnace, hot water heater, the fence from the yard,etc... About a month ago the city posted a massive sign on his door saying the home would be seized for \"blight\" if he did not correct the unspecified problem in a ridiculously short period of time. This really opened my eyes to the racket that is driven by the seizure of single family homes in Detroit.",
