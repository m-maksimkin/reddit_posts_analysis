Stop calling it in insurrection. It was a mob, plain and simple despite all of the propaganda. And no, the two people calling for hangings doesn't mean the entire mob intended on holding politicians hostage and then hanging them. We see exaggerations and stunts like that all the time from activists and protestors; very similar to when activists stood outside of rich people's homes with a guillotine. They weren't really trying to cut off rich people's heads.\n\nIf that was the case that this was an insurrection, we'd be seeing hundreds of charges on terrorism, treason, and a number of other life ending felonies.  If the FBI isn't treating it like an insurrection, its NOT an insurrection, plain and simple. And no, just because I call out BS and propaganda doesn't mean I'm defending these people.
