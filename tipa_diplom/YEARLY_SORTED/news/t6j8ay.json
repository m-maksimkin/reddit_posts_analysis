He did this because it is very easy to steal money on road works. On the other side, he has two achievements - he did not escape from Kyiv (I expected he will) and he does not interfere in the work of the Armed Forces.

Wire transfer and crypto options aren't accessible or convenient for many people. Over the weekend, the NBU updated their webpage with the new option of donating by credit card. Please note that online payment systems (PayPal, Venmo, etc.) don't work.

The NBU webpage fundraising for Ukraine's defense is, in addition to being on the NBU's official website, also (1) mentioned by the official Twitter account of Ukraine, (2) mentioned by several news sources, including Bloomberg and Business Insider, and (3) listed in the top pinned post in r/Ukraine.

If you go to the National Bank of Ukraine's official website, you'll find the donation announcement and donation page under their news announcements.\r  \n\r  \nYou should always ALSO donate to conventional NGOs such as Doctors Without Borders, Red Cross, International Rescue Committee, UNICEF, UNHCR, etc. to support much-needed humanitarian efforts. I would actually urge you to donate to humanitarian efforts first. At the same time, repelling Putin's invasion will most directly end the deaths and suffering in Ukraine, and only then, can the rebuilding begin.\r  \n\r  \nI scheduled a $500 wire transfer and made a $20 credit card \"test\" payment, and both seems to have worked: https://imgur.com/a/Aj42dRT.\r  \n\r  \nThere's a nominal processing fee involved for credit card payments, while banks normally charge $15 to $25 for wire transfers. If you're wiring the money, you should donate a higher amount so it's \"worth\" the wire transfer fee you might incur. International wire transfers involving intermediary / correspondent banks are also inconvenient and complicated if you haven't done them before. I'd recommend the credit card method.",

You always want to believe that this type of stuff doesn’t happen in 2022 but it absolutely does, as we have all learned. This shit is stressing ME out, and I’m typing this from the safety and comfort of my home on the other side of the world in the US. Think of how president Z feels, and how the regular people of Ukraine AND Russia feel. All pawns and strategic moves on a madman’s war map, desperate to get his own chapter in the history books who is now desperate just to hold on to his death grip of power and riches he has had around Russias throat for far too long. \n\nThe man is clearly not as in control as he used to be, or at least as we thought he used to be. I don’t see too many ways out of this for Poo-tin that don’t make him look like the absolute piece of shit he is. \n\nIf he kills Z I think he becomes a martyr and a national, nay Global, symbol of resistance and democracy. If he survives, it’s a slap in the face of Putin and shows him as the weak man he is. And even though Russia will likely “take control” of Ukraine eventually, we already have seen the economic and political standing erode due to the indiscriminate bombings and targeting of civilians. Not to mention the long term insurgency it has/will likely inspire meaning this will but be quickly and easily buttoned up, further cementing the view that the Russian millitsry is not as well trained, equipped, and motivated army as thought. \n\nI think Putin has stirred up local opposition to the point he can’t reverse things now. And I really hope Russians continue to protest and fight against all the damage he is causing. It would be a sweet sweet end should the Russian people put an end to this SOB themselves.
