They‚Äôre right. We don‚Äôt get a choice about it, and no one fucking informed us they were coming, either. To my knowledge, those are all FDA approved vaccinations‚Ä¶\n\nOr are they? They don‚Äôt fucking tell you. There‚Äôs no stopping to ask what they even *are*, let alone if they‚Äôre FDA approves. Boot camp- at least in the Marines- does a pretty good job of removing any sense of agency that you have. They remove your opportunity to think or act for your self. You‚Äôre counted down for *everything*- there‚Äôs a count down for brushing your fucking *teeth.* If you even so much as talk in the shot line at medical, you get ITed until your fucking lungs are exploding and put back in line. Rinse and repeat as many times as they feel like. That‚Äôs what boot camp **is**. There‚Äôs no time to stop and ask questions.\n\nSo stop with this argument that ‚Äúwe all get 12 vaccinations in boot camp, this is no different.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWe all have to get the flu shot, this is no different.‚Äù\n\nThose are all FDA approved vaccinations with significant years of research, study, and observation with well-known and documented side-effects.\n\nThis new vaccine for COVID isn‚Äôt nearly as well studied or time-tested yet.\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs safe! Science says so!‚Äù\n\nBitch we had no idea that asbestos caused lung cancer for a LONG time. California has ‚Äúthis shit may cause cancer‚Äù on *every*fucking*thing*. Every year someone tells us eggs are bad for us, and then every *other* year those some someones come back and tell us eggs are good for us.\n\nThis isn‚Äôt some liberal vs. conservative plot to divide the world. It‚Äôs not a sudden media coverup to cause a divide between skeptics and believers, and it certainly isn‚Äôt your run of the mill ‚ÄúI signed up for this and voluntarily waived my rights to choose and most of my freedoms‚Äù that all military members signed up for.\n\nThis is some unprecedented, untrodden ground that we‚Äôre paving, and military members don‚Äôt deserve to be used as unwilling guinea pigs‚Ä¶ **again**.\n\nWe‚Äôre not your fucking lab rats, we‚Äôre not your goddamn test tubes or incubators.\n\nWe‚Äôre people. Just like you. I served with prior teachers, high school students, mechanics, office clerks and a few former strippers. I served with a dude who came into the Marines as a Private and he was a fucking CEO in the normal world.\n\nNone of us gets to make these kinds of decisions for ourselves, and we shouldn‚Äôt be forced into taking experimental vaccines or vaccines developed a certain way for the first time in all of history before we‚Äôve had a chance to watch the science emerge and genuinely observe the outcomes, whatever they may be.\n\nNow I‚Äôm not personally against the vaccine at all. If you wanna get it, get it. If you don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs the shit **I** served for- so people can have the freedom to make their own fucking choices. Why the fuck do service members not get a choice like this?\n\nI‚Äôm not your fucking lab rat, and I‚Äôm tired of Reddit‚Äôs hyper-sheltered dick-bag couch experts insinuating that **actual lab rats** should have more fucking freedom than we service members do.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not a service member- current or prior- shut the fuck up.

The worse part about the vaccine was the itching and I'll take that anyday compared to getting small pox. \nCovid shot number 2 tore me up for a couple days but still, better than getting the real thing. I can't wait for all this to be over with and it'll always get worse before getting better but at least it will get better. Right? You'd think so after a certain amount of time anyways. Unless we all just die slowly of this shit and new strains form one after the other. Like some apocoplyse movie but instead of walking dead we have talking heads. Until they're gone too. What a way to go. Not in some grand meteoric extinction like dinosaurs but to a damn flu that we could've slowed and prevented. And we fade away. \n\nI'm hungry. What's for dinner?",
