Hes a dirty stinking lying politician, i'm sure he's guilty as the day is long.....just like the rest of ultra rich in Washington and NY.  I didn't vote for the guy but I do think its funny the great effort the prosecution keeps trying to convince us this **CLEARLY** politically motivated investigation isn't political.\n\nIts not political I pinky swear - Prosecutor \n\nBut then he handcuffs a 78 year old white collar crime and conducts an investigation going back 15 years.....tax investigations rarely go back further than 7....\n\nIf you seriously believe this isn't politically motivated I got a bridge in brooklyn to sell you and if you don't like bridges I got ocean front property in idaho for sale....i'll sell you the big blue sky and gullible isn't in the dictionary.",

They had billed Helmsley businesses for personal expenses ranging from her underwear to $3 million worth of renovations to their Connecticut estate. At its peak, their real estate empire was worth an estimated $5 billion.\n\nDuring the Helmsley trial, a former housekeeper testified that she heard Leona say “We don’t pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes.” Helmsley denied having said it, but the comment stuck.\n\nThe indictment was brought by then-Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudy Giuliani. Then-businessman Trump blamed Leona Helmsley — who'd been dubbed \"the queen of mean\" — for her husband's troubles in a letter that was obtained by the New York Post.\n\n\"Without the veil of Harry Helmsley, you would be a non-entity.
