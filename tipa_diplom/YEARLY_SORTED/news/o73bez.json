Giuliani acknowledged for the first time last night, in a television interview, that he had known about his father's criminal activity, which was revealed in a book published last month. The mayor said his father's mistakes had influenced him to go into law enforcement.\n\n> ''Some of it I knew, some of it I suspected,'' Mr. Giuliani said of the accounts in the book, ''Rudy! An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani,'' by Wayne Barrett.\n\n> The book describes Harold Giuliani's prison term for the armed robbery of a milkman and contends that the elder Giuliani was an enforcer for his brother-in-law's loan-sharking operation. ''Some of it,'' the mayor said, ''did come as a shock.''\n\n> Until yesterday, Mr. Giuliani, a former United States attorney, had refused to answer recent questions about his father, other than to defend him as scrupulously honest and the ''finest man'' he had ever known.\n\n..\n\n> Mr. Barrett's book also said that several of the mayor's cousins were involved in organized crime, and the mayor said that his parents' decision to move to Long Island was in part an attempt to get him away from an unsavory environment.\n\nMafia/bratva has infiltrated government and corporate since the 80s. Giuliani is just an enforcer/mafia lawyer.  [Trump was his boss and is connected to bratva](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate).\n\nThe Giuliani bratva ties go back to the 90s.\n\n[FBI TRACKED ALLEGED RUSSIAN MOB TIES OF GIULIANI CAMPAIGN SUPPORTER](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/elections/fbi-tracked-alleged-russian-mob-ties-of-giuliani-campaign-supporter/)\n\n> A prominent commodities trader who acknowledges a business history with a reputed Soviet Bloc crime figure and a notorious arms dealer has been one of New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s top campaign supporters.\n\n> Commodities trader Semyon (Sam) Kislin and his family also lavished thousands of dollars in contributions to Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, to the Clinton-Gore re-election campaign, to former Republican Sen. Alfonse D’Amato and to a number of state and city politicians. Kislin sits on the New York City Economic Development Board.\n\n> Kislin is not alone among emigres from the former Soviet Union who have successfully established themselves in the United States while law enforcement agencies, particularly the FBI, track their alleged associations with organized crime. The Center for Public Integrity has obtained confidential law enforcement documents detailing the activities of dozens of the emigres, but authorities rarely make cases and still less share the intelligence outside their departments.\n\n> A 1996 Interpol report claims that Kislin’s firm, Trans Commodities, Inc., was used by two reputed mobsters from Uzbekistan, Lev and Mikhail Chernoy, for fraud and embezzlement. And a confidential 1994 FBI intelligence report on the Brooklyn, N.Y., mob organization headed by Vyacheslav Ivankov, the imprisoned godfather of Russian organized crime in the United States, lists Kislin as a “member/associate” of Ivankov’s gang. It claims that his company co-sponsored a Russian crime boss and contract killer for a US visa and asserts that he was a “close associate” of the late notorious arms smuggler Babeck Seroush, who later settled in Russia.\n\nGiuliani is connected with Dmitry Firtash, known bratva oligarch, who he was working with for Trump. Firtash is connected to Putin and has ties to the bosses of the bratva in Russia.\n\n[Why Giuliani Singled Out 2 Ukrainian Oligarchs to Help Look for Dirt](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/us/giuliani-ukraine-oligarchs.html)\n\n> two Ukrainian oligarchs — Dmitry Firtash and Ihor Kolomoisky — as well as with several other people with knowledge of Mr. Giuliani’s dealings, point to a new dimension in his exertions on behalf of his client, Mr. Trump. Taken together, they depict a strategy clearly aimed at leveraging information from politically powerful but legally vulnerable foreign citizens.\n\n> In the case of Mr. Firtash, an energy tycoon with deep ties to the Kremlin who is facing extradition to the United States on bribery and racketeering charges, one of Mr. Giuliani’s associates has described offering the oligarch help with his Justice Department problems — if Mr. Firtash hired two lawyers who were close to President Trump and were already working with Mr. Giuliani on his dirt-digging mission. Mr. Firtash said the offer was made in late June when he met with Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, both Soviet-born businessmen involved in Mr. Giuliani’s Ukraine pursuit.\n\n[Trump of course has been tied to Russian bratva and money laundering since 1987](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate).",

This is why Trump's legal team had 0-60 record in the courts (imagine a sport where a team gets thumped 0-60).  Trump's legal team could not produce evidence of widespread election fraud so they lost all their court cases.  Even worse, some of the lawyers for Trump's team would claim \"election fraud\" outside of the courtroom, but inside the courtroom, they did not make the same claim because they were afraid of being disbarred for making false claims inside the courtroom.",
