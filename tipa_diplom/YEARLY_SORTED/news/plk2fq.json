I remember now that when I first moved to France, that my school (undergrad + postgrad) asked me to get booster shots for a bunch of vaccines and an extra one for meningitis. And this was required for everyone coming to the school. \n\nI have never been to Africa myself but colleagues of mine have and there too you are required to get vaccines before you can travel. \n\nThis should really be a non-issue like not a news item. Sure the circumstances are different and perhaps quarantine requirements are novel. But vaccine “passports” are hardly something to even report about. \n\nSo….

I'm very glad that the UK decided to end their lockdowns, but I'm very disappointed at how the US and France has doubled down on their vaccine thing. People should make their own choice on whether they want to get the covid vaccine, not have it forced upon by the government. Imo, it's called tyranny.\n\nAnd before you guys try and say that I'm against the vaccine or anything, no, I'm not. If anything, people should talk to their doctor before getting the vaccine. Vaccines do work, and I even have one myself. It's just the fact that the chance of surviving covid is high, especially for people like me. So to see these governments, including my own, treat this as the worst issue in america, and then use it as a political tool to batter the heads of right-wingers over it for simply wanting a choice over their body, is disappointing at best. Yes, we shouldn't politicize this issue. But unfortunately, this was politicized a long time ago.",
