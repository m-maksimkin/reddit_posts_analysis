It was so egregious that If you visited that  sub and saw them talk about it, even they admitted it was absolutely messed up. Even Trump called it a disgrace. (At the time- if I remember correctly he later shared the owens video and talked about how floyd would be smiling from heaven at our economy, Christ) \n\nThen slowly but surely the narrative changed, talking about Floyds record as if it had any relevance to what happened that day, that disgusting candace owens video that went viral. The way I see conservatives talk about him now is genuinely just horrible. Complete lack of empathy for a human being while also being completely misinformed on the facts of the case and trial. \n\nThe best witness the defense had was that washed up ex cop testifying on use of force who was **absolutely bodied** by the prosecution, and the prosecution had one of the world's literal foremost expert pulmonologists give a complete breakdown of Floyd's final moments. Doesn't matter- apparently it's a rigged trial. \n\nAnd then to turn around and talk about Ashli Babbit like she's the perfect example of police brutality while Chauvin is supposedly innocent, it's just infuriating. Talk about any of this in any conservative sub and you get banned. \n\nSorry, *cancelled.*",

Why isn't the chief of police under investigation for him remaining in a position of power despite obvious evidence that he was a shitheel? Or the city council for allowing  it? Why, with a police force famous for closing ranks around their own, was everyone within the higher up police chain so willing to toss him overboard?\n\nI'm not saying Chauvin didn't get what he deserved, but it does feel like they tried to stop all conversation past that point.",
