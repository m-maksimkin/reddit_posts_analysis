Content containing nudity will continue to be allowed as long as it is consistent with the policy. \n\nExisting content that does not meet the standards of the new policy will need to be removed before December 1, 2021. \n\nOur intention is for the policy to be implemented in accordance with the above dates, but we may need to change one or more of the dates as circumstances may require.\n\nHere is a link to the new Acceptable Use Policy – https://www.onlyfans.com/aup \n\nWhy did the policy have to change? \n\nDue to the size and rapid growth of the OnlyFans platform, where creators have earned over $5 billion dollars since inception, we must increasingly rely on large banking institutions and payment processors to facilitate payments between fans and creators. The new rules are necessary to comply with the requirements of these financial institutions and are the only way to help ensure the long-term sustainability of OnlyFans. \n\nOnlyFans was founded as a diverse and inclusive home for all content creators and we stand by our commitment to that mission. We will continue to support and guide all creators through these necessary changes, making sure that all creators have a home on our platform. \n\nWe look forward to continuing to provide an innovative platform for our diverse creator community. \n\nThank you,\nOnlyFans Team”\n\nFrom today 8/25/2021 \n\n“Dear OnlyFans Creator, \n\nOur Acceptable Use Policy will remain the same and may be found at: https://onlyfans.com/terms \n\nThe proposed October 1, 2021 changes are no longer required due to banking partners' assurances that OnlyFans can support all genres of creators. \n\nOnlyFans is committed to providing a safe and dependable platform for all creators and their fans. \n\nThank you,\nOnlyFans Team”",

Onlyfans did not willingly decide to ban adult content. It was forced on them by their credit card processor and credit card companies. Remove adult content or lose credit cards. Visa probably doesn’t like the risk of supporting CP and the payments to onlyfans probably includes a lot of fraud.\n\nI’ve been in this position before myself in my wife and I’s small online business. We were processing credit cards in a market ripe with fraud. We did all of the right things for avoiding it, like using maxmind, and would deal with chargebacks and reports responsibly. But then we switched processors and suddenly they freaked out about  chargebacks in the first few months and they straight up blacklisted us in the entire industry.

If they weren't 100% sure that they could stop people from hosting illegal content, it was safer for them from a business perspective to lose 90+% of their revenue than risk being shut down entirely by the whims of the credit companies. With that context in mind, I'm actually surprised by the reversal; it's kind of a huge risk.

But we are a whole lot more than porn. Our product, our specialty is providing a platform for creators to bring what they create to the public and a broader market. As you can see from the growth metrics in slide X we have the attention of the broader internet, not just the porn consuming connected public.”  Completely ignoring fucking YOUTUBE among others that are live streaming.\nNo metrics around NSFW work content were even considered or reviewed.  Everyone (virtually) present gave themselves a pat on the back and the savvy among them immediately started figuring out how to divest.\nCompanies of this size almost never fail to disappoint when it comes to laying to bare how poorly they are run.  Lots of managers, not (if any) enough leaders who are connected enough to understand what it is they actually DO.\nWhen in fact it all could have been avoided by simply working the problem.
