He was initially investigated by an officer that gave him nothing but a ‘stern talk’ and THAT officer was later arrested on child pornography charges himself!!\n\nSeriously, read this https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Duggar#2015\n\nIt is absolutely one of the most infuriating things I have ever read in my life. If this story was a movie you’d say it was not realistic that he’d get away with what he did for as long as he did. It seems like the only reason he didn’t get arrested a long time ago was because his victims were his own sisters. Maybe everyone already knows this whole story and I’m late to the party but i just read this and said WHAT THE FUCK out loud multiple times to myself.\n\nQuote from wiki: “Gerald Faulkner, a special agent for Homeland Security Investigations, stated the files on the computer were \"in the top five of the worst of the worst that I've ever had to examine\".One of the videos allegedly in Duggar's possession, created by Peter Scully, depicts the rape and torture of an 18-month-old toddler.”\n\nThis guy was first called out publicly for being a pedophile over a decade ago. Wasn’t arrested for anything until this year in large part cause his daddy was a state senator and he was reality tv star. Our criminal justice system is FUCKED.",

In 2012, Joshua Duggar addressed rallies for the Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.[26][27]\n\nFrom June 2013 to May 2015, he was executive director of FRC Action, a political action and lobbying organization sponsored by the Family Research Council.[3][25][26][28]\n\nWhen describing his position with the organization, he stated that he would be focused on \"engaging the grassroots and taking the message of faith, family and freedom all across America\".[29]\n\nFamily Research Council president Tony Perkins said that by hiring Duggar they hoped to appeal to more young people by tapping into the popularity of the Duggar family TV series.\n\nHe further stated, \"The big part of Josh's focus is going to be building our grass-roots across the country\".[30] While working at FRC Action, conservative Republican candidates valued Duggar as a way to advance their messages to his constituents.[31]\n\nHe campaigned for Republican Senate candidates in Kansas, Mississippi, and Virginia before the 2014 midterm elections.[31]\n\nHe described his family as the \"epitome of conservative values\"[31] and advocates for what he terms \"family-centered\" and conservative Christian right political viewpoints, including opposition to abortion, divorce, and gay marriage.[25][30]\n\nJosh Duggar has been referred to as an \"anti-gay activist\" by GLAAD, a pro-LGBT rights organization formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[32][33][34]\n\n•\t⁠Wikipedia",
