In 2012, Joshua Duggar addressed rallies for the Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania.[26][27]\n\nFrom June 2013 to May 2015, he was executive director of FRC Action, a political action and lobbying organization sponsored by the Family Research Council.[3][25][26][28]\n\nWhen describing his position with the organization, he stated that he would be focused on \"engaging the grassroots and taking the message of faith, family and freedom all across America\".[29]\n\nFamily Research Council president Tony Perkins said that by hiring Duggar they hoped to appeal to more young people by tapping into the popularity of the Duggar family TV series.\n\nHe further stated, \"The big part of Josh's focus is going to be building our grass-roots across the country\".[30] While working at FRC Action, conservative Republican candidates valued Duggar as a way to advance their messages to his constituents.[31]\n\nHe campaigned for Republican Senate candidates in Kansas, Mississippi, and Virginia before the 2014 midterm elections.[31]\n\nHe described his family as the \"epitome of conservative values\"[31] and advocates for what he terms \"family-centered\" and conservative Christian right political viewpoints, including opposition to abortion, divorce, and gay marriage.[25][30]\n\nJosh Duggar has been referred to as an \"anti-gay activist\" by GLAAD, a pro-LGBT rights organization formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.[32][33][34]\n\n‚Ä¢\t‚Å†Wikipedia",
