            "text": "All these people saying this is not worthy of a museum, try to learn some history. This vaccine for Covid will save millions of lives. This person is an example of the human race taking the risk to save those lives. \n\nFor example when Polio Vaccines were finally being distributed:\n\n\"It was a celebration worth remembering 50 years later. Throughout the nation on April 12, 1955, church bells rang out, kids were let out of school, people danced in the streets.\n\n\"Polio routed!\" newspaper headlines screamed. \"Salk's vaccine works!\"\n\n[Article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2005-04-12-0504120316-story.html) - just one that I found doing a simple search.\n\n\"It's hard to imagine an era when people had more confidence that science would solve their problems if everybody did his part. Polio--a major childhood crippler and killer--was the first disease to be attacked and publicized in ways we now take for granted.\n\nPoster children appeared for the first time; celebrities rushed to do public service announcements.\n\n\"This is a great American story. Everybody had a stake in it,\" said Dr. Howard Markel, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan who directs the Center for the History of Medicine. \"Parents gave freely to the March of Dimes, a private charity, to pay for the research. They were clamoring to get their kids in experimental trials--polio could paralyze or kill you, but they were completely confident that Salk's vaccine would be safe.\"",

I know for sure it’s not AstraZeneca or J&J because they are not good and countries stopped giving them out. Moderna and Pfizer is under FDA EUA not 100% approved, Covaxin from India is on stage 3&4 for USA FDA full approval & currently being reviewed by WHO for international use. \nI’m happy for her and all the good stuff but what is the name of the first FDA approved Covid19 vaccine ( either Biotech name or commercial name will help, thanks 😎) my family and I received both jabs of  Pfizer. Manufacturer/developer: BioNTech, Fosun Pharma, Pfizer\nResearch name: BNT162b2. BioNTech was created by Muslim doctors and it’s 100% halal no joke😎👍",
