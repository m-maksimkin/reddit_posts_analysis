If he handed you 600k, would you cry about him being a billionaire and not giving you more!? I fucking hope not.\n\nEdit 2: This isn’t about the coverage he got from doing this, but let’s pretend for a minute that it is. Simply by not ignoring this post, and many other posts like it, you are inevitably giving said billionaire the coverage they potentially want from donating in the first place. If it wasn’t news, then why the hell does it bother you so much? The real news, to me, is that people are so damn greedy, they will take and take because they think it is never enough. \n\nIt’s really about the money it’s self. He didn’t give enough because he is so rich :( shame on him for giving anything at all right? He should have just not done it if you don’t think it was gonna be enough. I feel bad for the LGBTQIA+ community if you guys are its representers. Nobody will take them seriously.

The first week i came over, his son showed me his dads MASSIVE porn collection he hides in his closet. It was litterally a giant closet FULL-  floor to ceiling stacked of porn tapes with covers in tact. He’s married. I did not understand this. Even today he’s still as high rank as they can be in the Mormon church. Idk much about Mormonism but this guy had the biggest porn collection I’ve ever seen.. even in my adult life. His one closet (he had other hiding locations in the house) made the local sex store look like a mom and pop. \nVery nice guy, very active in the church but goodness.",

They were golden plates in a D-ring binder.\n\nOnly Smith could read the texts, written in reformed Egyptian (a language unknown to linguists and Egyptologists) via seer stones in his hat. Only Smith could use the stones.\n\nThe seer stones have never been found; Mormons accept 24-year-old Smith’s account (The Book of Mormon) because witnesses said they also saw the text (but could not read it). After dictating to a scribe, Smith subsequently lost the book, so an angel revoked his ability to translate. Witnesses reasoned that Smith was telling the truth because no one could make up a story 270,000 words long. There is no physical evidence of the existence of the plates or the stones. \n\nIn 1831 in Ohio, Smith discovered a group of communal people that engaged in rolling on the ground and speaking in tongues. He converted them to Mormonism.\n\nIn 1841, Smith began to reveal a doctrine of plural marriage and became a proponent of polygamy.\n\nThe Mormon church released photos of the stones in 2015.\n\nThey believe that Kolob is a special sacred planet.  They believe that when they die they will each get their own planet.\n\nThey believe that the Garden of Eden was somewhere near Independence, Missouri.\n\nTo this day, Mormons are expected to wear magical underwear called “Temple Garments” after completing “endowments”, and participate in a secret handshake.\n\nThe Mormon church believes that they are organized in the same way that the church was when Christ was still alive.\n\nThe first law in the religion is one of obedience.\n\nETA - Clarification re: Temple Garments, verbiage and additional information from an ex-Mormon",

If you would actually look into the teachings, you would find this very quickly.\n\nThe only opportunity that is not offered to some members of the LGBTQ community is marriage in the Mormon temple, because their church is built on the principal that \"marriage between a man and woman is ordained of God\". You are still allowed to be part of the religion if you are a member of the LGBTQ community, and you will quickly find that you are showered by acceptance by the members of the church\n\nObviously not all things in the church are at equal to what is considered socially equal or right in the current day. Women can't receive the priesthood, and up until the 1900s, black people weren't allowed to join the church. However, you can see activity like this in tons of other organizations. Just because you don't agree with something, doesn't mean you have to demonize the members and push hate towards people that are some of the friendliest you will ever meet\n\nI just think it's funny that this toxic site decides it's okay to push hate against something as long as some headline says \"so and so is homophobic, racist, or sexist\"",

Many of them dedicated 2 entire fucking years to walk in the cold/extreme heat to “serve the Lord”. The foundation of their spirituality comes from the church's teachings. Their base definitions of morality comes from what they learned in the church.

Needless to say I have been enjoying my home ever since.\n\nI was shocked a pastor could afford a home this expensive (I have a decent sized business I started after working in the Big 4 firm world for a decade where there are a ton of Mormons and they are nice people).\n\nAlso I would like to state that generally people who are brought up religious may have been fooled by stuff we can proof is impossible or whatever, but they are nonetheless trying to make the world better on earth too.
