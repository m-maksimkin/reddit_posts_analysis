Her politics are shit and she’s a fucking idiot bordering on mentally ill because of these beliefs, but that doesn’t make this a good event. She wasn’t some rabbit animal put down for attacking people. She’s a human, a veteran, a daughter, a wife, and more. It’s crazy how people can cheer on and be entertained by the loss of an Americans life. Especially with how many officers were there within seconds, I start to doubt whether it was indeed necessary at that point. \n\nThose who participated in the insurrection deserve to be punished, no doubt.  Death though is not the proper punishment and the determining factor of their political affiliation being the reason as such is pathetic. It’s a tragedy for every person that lost their life that day on a dark day for American history. The fact that anyone can joke about the death of Individuals is sickening.",

It can be excused, we look the other way, and that's it.\n\nHe was \"cleared\" yesterday and he's already out pumping his own tires today?  That's shameful, and we are too for going along with it.\n\nYou cannot kill someone that way, even a domestic terrorist like Babbitt.  The laws vary from state to state, but they all have common elements that would deem this a premature use of lethal force.\n\nPolice officers do not get to shoot someone because of what they think might happen in five minutes or ten minutes or even one minute.  They don't get to fatally guess what might be in a backpack, or what a sketchy looking person might do ten seconds from now.  It has to be clear, they have to witness it, it has to be now, and there has to be no other choice.  This shooting fails on all the standards.\n\nThe standard everywhere is immediate death or serious injury.  Climbing through the window was unwanted and maybe you could even call it threatening, but it's still miles away from the standard.  I frequently see people claiming the killing was legal because someone told her to stop.  That's so not the case, and we should be glad.  We don't want a country where police can say \"stop\" and then kill suspects, let alone have a parade if they do.  \n\nThe standards for choosing to take a life are tough, and they should be.  \n\nStrip away who the victim is, and this is a shooting that 999 times out of 1000 we'd rightfully protest as police misuse of force.\n\nI was grudgingly fine with his aligned and biased institutions \"clearing\" him, for reasons.

Counter-act news outlets and social media that spew falsities, improper derision, and lies by sanctions, regulations and immediate corrections.

It is only stopped when the narrator's friend shoots the religious nut dead. The reaction of her gathered \"flock\", who were again about to murder a child, is damn near identical to what happened with Babbitt. As King puts it in the novella, \"It was like the teacher had suddenly come back in the classroom and slammed the door on a bunch of misbehaving kids, startling them into silence.\"\n\nBeyond that I ain't got much more to add. Beyond what Forrest Gump once said, \"Stupid is as stupid does.\" And never forget who the real killer is here: Donald Trump. If that malignant anthropomorphic tumor had not put the thought in her brainwashed head she probably would have just went on to being another kook rambling away on Facebook. But Trump wound her up like a clockwork soldier with his rhetoric, delusions and lust for power.\n\nTrump is, in effect, no different than the machiavellian wife that cons her duped lover into killing her husband.
