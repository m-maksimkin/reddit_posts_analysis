Burger flipping, pouring coffee, many store clerks, push products that are so low priced only because the people that do the work are subsidising the costs through their own low pay. What people don't think is, what are the opportunity costs of having a person do a job that adds so little to the overall economy, it requires this subsidy? Every person flipping burgers, isn't using their abilities to their maximum, and is therefore acting as a drag on the economy by working that job. We would be better off if we concentrated on creating higher levels of employment for people and raise the minimum wage so high, fast food would be put out of business. Good, it deserves to go out of business. If your business model is so weak it ONLY works at slave wage prices, you're a slave owner, not an employer.\n\nSo what happens to all the people who lose their jobs? The government may have to step in to create the higher quality of jobs, but even if these jobs turn out to not be expressly profitable, the jobs people are doing NOW aren't legitimately profitable, either. At least the jobs the government makes will add value by the work that they do. Literal profitability should be considered secondary to what that job adds to the economy as a whole. We don't ask doctors (in most countries) to be profitable. I'd say it wouldn't be hard to find a lot of other things worth doing that are better than leaving people to languish as servants.",

For me to take them off UE, based on a 40 hour work week I have to start them at $35.60 per hour which is approx $10-12 per hour above normal market wages. I've offered a few up to $30 an hour as a starting wage which some accepted. Had one idiot email me saying he'd be willing to take $25/hr IF I agreed to pay him off the books which I respectfully declined. However I did have my HR dept forward his email to the labor board and with any luck his UE and stimulus benefits were terminated.

After spending the day packing the damn thing, and then  my dad fixing unexpected mechanical issues (which I cannot recall what they where and almost prevented us from leaving), we headed out on the road. Super excited...super hungry. We had never tried BK (formally named Burger King) before, always either homemade or Mom & Pop diners first, then Mcd’s or Wendys for a treat if we we’re lucky. On the way out of town we got BK....and that, as a hungry 8yr old, desperate for a take-out burger, was so surprisingly disappointed. It was the day I decided BK was not worthy of the ‘fast food burger club’ and they ruined the start of my perfect day of a grand adventure. I found their cheese burger disgusting in ways I could not describe, not good enough for homemade burger, not engineered enough for fast food burger, just middle ground bad - no mans land of taste. Even compared to the dried up patty, one depressing pickle, stale and slightly damp bun in the happy meal at McDonald’s. To this day I do not know how anyone can screw up a fast food burger as much they can and how they are still in business. To this day I avoid BK even if it’s the only thing in miles on principle. This is my story, not an interesting one, maybe a touch bias, but nonetheless a true story. Fuck BK.",

So, I applied to Burger King. I'd worked a grocery store in high school, interview should be all of 10 minutes right?\n\nThe interview with the manager was... interesting. He called the grocery store I worked in across the country and talked for an hour. This was back when long distance was an (expensive) thing. The interview itself lasted over an hour and consisted of him telling me how proud I should be to work for a corporation that had such a future, how I should start thinking how good it will be after 20 years there, blah blah blah.\n\nThe campus job opened up a month or so later, but that summer I had to return to family across the country. The grocery store wasn't an option, I needed to work the summer... and Burger King turned out to be the wrong answer. Imagine the above, but in a fairly depressing midwestern town there were people who honestly *believed* it. I worked briefly with a woman I knew in high school and all I could think of was poor her... completely nuts and corporate lapdog as a fry chef.\n\nYuck.",

We will go to midtown (our other location) from here forward.” \nThey left $2.00 on a $112.37 tab. \n\nAdding an Edit for context. My establishment is a 2 - story place with an outside deck on the top floor. We are open 11am to 11pm on the weekdays and this group showed up at 10:50. We had no tables upstairs or on the deck for hours at that point and management had cut all front-house staff two hours prior. There were only 2 of us and our bar seating downstairs was completely full, but we still had all of our (10 - top seating per table) outside tables available and our inside first floor tables available. There was maybe 120 seconds between the moment they sat themselves and the moment I delivered their menus and waters (party of 3). They gave me their drink orders (couple beers) and those were then delivered within 180 seconds (the delay was because I had to change two kegs out of the three different beers) - They gave me their orders and everything was set and they were good to go so returned back downstairs to help my only coworker at the moment with a full bar... 5-6 minutes before last call. Anywho - 5 minutes pass and we are now closed - and they CALL (yes, they use their phones to call the number downstairs) to explain that they wanted 3 of their 7 items delivered AS APPETIZERS after they had specifically stated that they wanted everything at once previously. \n\nWent up, checked on them, gave another round of beers, ( 4 trips up and down) and they seemed happy. Ran their items as early as I could despite their piss-poor timing because they werent the only other people to want full meals within 10 minutes of close as we had a 6 item to-go order call in at 10:58pm. Now the kitchen is readjusting and their third item that they called downstairs about would have to end up being delivered with their entrees. Ran their food \n\nThe burden of our livelihoods should not have fallen onto them  in the first Fucking place - but if it does - you can bet your sweet ass that in the land of “hate everything not me” that these assholes are gonna abuse whatever power you give them and the power of an employees wage shouldn’t fall on these assholes that want more heart-attack sauce on their colostomy-bag-burger",

Maybe having 3/4 people on the clock at most at any given time. I kid you not I would get calls from the District Manager at least 2/3 times a week telling me we needed to \"cut labor costs\" IE sent people home early. Keep in mind these are people that just had their hours cut to 30 hours or less a week to avoid having to offer healthcare (only the GM and two assistant GM's had healthcare). \n\nOur \"labor costs\" were maybe 8% of overall operating costs at any given time, then after I sent people home I would get bitched at for slow drive thru times. No fucking shit I only have myself and maybe 1 or 2 other employees to take counter orders , drive thru orders, make food, clean and everything else we had to do and try to not be there 4 hours after closing.

Customers would complain to me then ask for my manager and I'd say no, and them one of them said that they're gonna write a complaint about me and I told them go ahead they won't fire me. Two weeks later and they still haven't fired me. \n\nMy coworker had to get into a argument with the general manager to be give a break from work. Not fired, but a break. \n\nOther then that our broiler and our fryer have malfunctioned, broken down, undercooked food, refused to turn on, overcooked food. Sometimes we'll be in a lunch rush and the broiler broke or the fryer broke. 2 days ago the machine almost caught fire and the fire suppressant system was about to go off. The fryer went up in smoke last friday and set off a smoke alarm. The broiler worked normally this morning and then proceeded to undercook burgers the rest of the day.\n\nTbh Burger King really isnt that bad of food tbh, it tastes like fast food and it's pretty cheap. The problem is that the company wont send us new equipment, they just send repair guys to fix it, then it gets fixed just to break again. We cant do anything because the machines are way beyond our pay grade and understanding. And we cant just make the burgers ourselves cause theres no open grill, if the fryers break were out of chicken sandwiches and fries. The ice cream machine hasn't worked since before I work there. The icee machine tends to malfunction 3 out of 7 days. \n\nOverall the food is fine and our employers are nice to me, the problem is our garbage machinery.",

I need up quitting after I got approved for vacation time twice and then told I couldn't take it. I was sitting with 158 hours of vacation time. When I quit they had to pay me all of that and pto on top of the salary for the pay period. It's sad to see how piss poor they treat employees and only care about money",

I regularly see on Reddit workers complaining, but never anything of substance as to whether the low pay is purely from greedy owners or due to some other factor/s. \nI'm from Australia and our staff get paid pretty reasonably (I think), and when I was in the states I really didn't think food/drink was any cheaper after currency conversion. That said I do see (failing) small businesses here complain sometimes about staff wages being too high - however it almost always seems to be that the business would be failing regardless (e.g, in a low foot traffic area etc). For context my family owns a (failing) cafe and it is due to Covid causing low numbers of workers in the CBD where we are located along with lockdowns etc, it means it's hard to pay staff overheads but that is due to outside factors imo, not the rates being too high to start with.",

This was the time of the Angus promotion.  What?  I didn't fold the wrapper just right to cover the G so the customer saw \"The Anus?\"  There is no way that was not going to happen.  The place was so wasteful.  The manager would have a bucket and all the mistakes had to be thrown in the bucket.  The manager would take the free burgers home.  Did the employees get those?  Heck no.  The owner's concept was that giving us free food means we wouldn't buy it.  So we got a 10% discount instead.  That's right, screw up a whopper and it goes in that bucket before any employee's guts.  I remember when the minimum wage increased by 25 cents and the owner freaked out and said \"Well, we are going to have to cut hours across the board to make up for it\"  25 cents.  So you made 8.25 instead of 8.  I wonder how they dealt with an increase to 15/hr?  the best part was when BK Corporate would do a walkthrough and would give us crap about not making a \"10 second whopper\".   All I could think of is the fact that this person probably went to college for years and only has fast food to show for it.  Fast food joints just don't understand that employees can at least make the same money anywhere else even if they quit during a shift.  Should probably be rewarding the good employees instead of expecting them to be a fail-safe when the other employees quit.   If fast food places ever succeed in replacing humans with automated labor, they should have a tax to make up for the lost human wages, insurance, etc that they would be able to avoid using robots.  Something to think about.  If you start seeing robots taking your order and serving your food, stage a protest with htis in mind.",

The managers treated you like absolute shit. I remember it would be a Friday night and the servers had screwed up by seating the entire wait at once rather than staggering them like they are supposed to, And it being my fault that there are 15 tickets in the window. Later that night however the managers would all be singing a different tune after the two meth heads they kept rehiring walked out And they realized if I did the same thing they would be left to clean up the ungodly mess that was left behind in the kitchen. I was burned, splashed with hot oil, cut , and earned a bulged disc in my lower spine lifting kegs for those fucks. No appreciation.
