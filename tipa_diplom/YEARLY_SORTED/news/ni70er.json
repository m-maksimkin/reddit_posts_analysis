I absolutely wasn't, I was sitting up at my desk writing in my journal the entire night, and had the timed journal entries to prove it. But he would have none of it. I told him I was up all night and no one came around for the vast majority of the night and told him to go look at the cameras if he didn't believe me but he wouldn't. He just wrote in my file that I was a chronic liar, something I've had to work hard to shake from other psychiatrists over the years. Keep in mind the only reason I was even in the psych ward was because I admitted myself because I was suicidal. \n\nThe nurses/guards aren't going to come around every 15 minutes. They didn't when I was in jail on suicide watch, they didn't any time I was in the psych ward on suicide watch, and they didn't when I was in detox (they're supposed to come around every 15 at night for everyone to make sure you didn't overdose). They aren't paid enough to care and in every single one of those situations they were all falsifying the records instead of doing what they were supposed to.",

New York City's medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.\n\nI.e. they didn't take their jobs seriously. Doesn't point to a conspiracy.\n\n>Sen. Ben Sasse, a Republican member of the Senate judiciary committee who has been a vocal critic of the Justice Department's handling of Epstein's case, called the deal \"unacceptable\" and said the public deserves to see a report detailing the prison agency's failures.  \n>  \n>\"One hundred hours of community service is a joke — this isn't traffic court,\" Sasse said in a statement. \"The leader of an international child sex trafficking ring escaped justice, his co-conspirators had their secrets go to the grave with him, and these guards are going to be picking up trash on the side of the road.\"\n\nHe has a point, though I'm not sure Epstein wouldn't have been able to kill himself (if that's what happened) if these people were doing their jobs. I don't know exactly what their jobs entailed.\n\n>Prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas sat at their desks some four metres from Epstein's cell, shopped online for furniture and motorcycles, and walked around the unit's common area instead of making required rounds every 30 minutes.  \n>  \n>During one two-hour period, both appeared to have been asleep, according to the indictment filed against them.  \n>  \n>Both officers who were guarding Epstein were working overtime because of staffing shortages. One of the guards, who did not primarily work as a correctional officer, was working a fifth straight day of overtime. The other guard was working mandatory overtime, meaning a second eight-hour shift of the day.\n\nMandatory second 8-hour shift? What the fuck is that? Although it seems like a very easy job, but a 16-hour workday, sheesh.\n\n>Staffing shortages at the agency are so severe that guards often work overtime day after day or are forced to work mandatory double shifts. Violence leads to regular lockdowns at federal prison compounds across the U.S. And a congressional report released in 2019 found that \"bad behaviour is ignored or covered up on a regular basis.\"  \n>  \n>The falsification of records has been a problem throughout the federal prison system. Union officials have long argued that the reduction of staff is putting both guards and inmates in danger, but they've faced an uphill battle getting attention.\n\nDepending on how a job is set up the staffing may not be the primary issue. People can do stuff just to get through a job if they aren't made to do a proper job from above, and the above is a source of problems too. Dealing with \"bad behavior\" here could be an exceptional task, not something you walk in and sit your way through. It entails personal discomfort and perhaps a higher standard for the type of person (physically very much included) doing the job. Being a guard at a place like that is not a library job.",

If they really want to get the real epstein killers then put them in witness protection (probably won't work) and let them talk but give the impression that they are being punished for not talking.
