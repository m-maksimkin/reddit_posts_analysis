I once got into an argument with the doctor on site because I told him I hadn't been sleeping and was up all night. He straight up told me I was lying because the nurse came around every 15 all night and wrote down I was sleeping. I absolutely wasn't, I was sitting up at my desk writing in my journal the entire night, and had the timed journal entries to prove it. But he would have none of it. I told him I was up all night and no one came around for the vast majority of the night and told him to go look at the cameras if he didn't believe me but he wouldn't. He just wrote in my file that I was a chronic liar, something I've had to work hard to shake from other psychiatrists over the years. Keep in mind the only reason I was even in the psych ward was because I admitted myself because I was suicidal. \n\nThe nurses/guards aren't going to come around every 15 minutes. They didn't when I was in jail on suicide watch, they didn't any time I was in the psych ward on suicide watch, and they didn't when I was in detox (they're supposed to come around every 15 at night for everyone to make sure you didn't overdose).

New York City's medical examiner ruled his death a suicide.\n\nI.e. they didn't take their jobs seriously. Doesn't point to a conspiracy.\n\n>Sen.

I don't know exactly what their jobs entailed.\n\n>Prosecutors alleged that Noel and Thomas sat at their desks some four metres from Epstein's cell, shopped online for furniture and motorcycles, and walked around the unit's common area instead of making required rounds every 30 minutes.  \n>  \n>During one two-hour period, both appeared to have been asleep, according to the indictment filed against them.  \n>  \n>Both officers who were guarding Epstein were working overtime because of staffing shortages.

The other guard was working mandatory overtime, meaning a second eight-hour shift of the day.\n\nMandatory second 8-hour shift? What the fuck is that? Although it seems like a very easy job, but a 16-hour workday, sheesh.\n\n>Staffing shortages at the agency are so severe that guards often work overtime day after day or are forced to work mandatory double shifts. Violence leads to regular lockdowns at federal prison compounds across the U.S. And a congressional report released in 2019 found that \"bad behaviour is ignored or covered up on a regular basis.\"  \n>  \n>The falsification of records has been a problem throughout the federal prison system. Union officials have long argued that the reduction of staff is putting both guards and inmates in danger, but they've faced an uphill battle getting attention.\n\nDepending on how a job is set up the staffing may not be the primary issue. People can do stuff just to get through a job if they aren't made to do a proper job from above, and the above is a source of problems too. Dealing with \"bad behavior\" here could be an exceptional task, not something you walk in and sit your way through. It entails personal discomfort and perhaps a higher standard for the type of person (physically very much included) doing the job. Being a guard at a place like that is not a library job.",
