In a park outside the courthouse, they would blast his music and write “Free R. Kelly” across the pavement in chalk. During court proceedings (the public and press viewed the trial remotely in an overflow room due to COVID safety protocols), fans would regularly interject to insult witnesses, accuse them of lying, and mutter their support to the defense. Disputes between the supporters over limited seats were commonplace, and one was arrested after a fellow supporter reported him for sexual harassment.  \n  \nJesus fucking christ what is wrong with these people?",

I remember watching a documentary about this back in 2018 and they were talking about stuff as far back as 2000... he didn't even try to hide a lot of the stuff but now we get the news like it was a surprise. Celebrities are way too protected, hell even guys like Drake and MGK have been openly shady and absolutely nothing is happening. They aren't human trafficking or kidnapping but both openly have a predilection for underage girls and it is just glossed over.",

It isn't worth getting dragged through the mud when the chances of convicting rapists is so low. The detective had me call the one guy to try to get him to confess on a recorded line. Of course it didn't work. People think that there's so many women falsely reporting rapes and are on the side of the accused. The majority of reports are not false ones.  It's just hard to prove. I have PTSD but it probably would be much worse if I went through with trying to win in court.  Even with a rape kit.",
