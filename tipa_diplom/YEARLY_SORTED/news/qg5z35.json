I think the Dads missing in the movie are walking the park wearing a Disney sweater waiting in line for 4 hours to ride the tea cups. And then Disney bought Marvel, of course, cause Disney has to steal every corner of childrens imagination, leaving no stone unturned so they lute them into the park, charge their family $200 each to get in and then charge $12.50 for a churro.  But its ok, cause Disney characters aren't real and wont ever be exposed for sending racist emails. Disney controls the narrative, the price, and charges $30 for parking. Season pass holders, dont get me started, biggest mistake ever, if there are a group of people who want to go there a dozen times a year, they actually shouldnt be allowed in the park, rheres something wrong with you, get a life. Doesnt legoland not let adults in without a kid, makes sense to me. But Disneyland has groomed generations of grown ups to be weirdos that like to wait in line and pretend that star wars and princesses are real.

Some of the food is good, fun and convenient, but there‚Äôs some great food around Anaheim\n\n\n- Get there early and try to stay late to get everything you want done.  In the morning, rides that aren‚Äôt thrill rides are walk-ons,  get there literally first thing, and give yourself about 30-40 mins ahead of time to get through security and park.  If you stay late, Disney will artificially increase the line wait times to discourage people staying in the attraction, especially after fireworks shows.  If you hop on a ride right as the park is closing they will always clear out the line, and a 120 minute wait might be actually a 60 min wait, 50 minute wait might be a 20 min wait.",

Knotts during ghost town alive was a massively more entertaining and fun experience that I would‚Äôve gladly paid more to enjoy had I know I was going to have such a great time. I also made it a point to buy plenty of souvenirs meanwhile my time at Disneyland was extremely forgettable and honestly just a disappointment. Anything that could‚Äôve remotely been worth paying for was put behind a paywall beyond the admission price. \n\nI‚Äôd rather Disney raise their prices far more for admission but instead include all the experiences that as of right now you have to pay extra for. The raised prices do not discourage people from coming but instead they make for a poor experience by putting anything worthwhile outside of the ride behind more paywalls. \n\nKnotts on the other hand during ghost town alive was a very entertaining experience where I actually found myself having a great time following the characters around and being involved in the little story they had. I honestly could‚Äôve spent almost my whole time there having fun with the characters and the little fun things they had set up like getting a face painted mustache, drawing a reward sign, or getting a picture with the bandits and outlaws. It was such a fun time and the rides were just a bonus to relax in line and get on a fun ride. \n\nDisney had no such magic and was a rather sad experience with rides being the one and only thing to enjoy because everything else was out priced because we had already spent over a thousand dollars to go for just one day. It sucked and I regret going because the entire experience was basically my family wishing we could enjoy the other things or enjoying souvenirs but because my family planned the trip around there past experiences we all got limited to one meal each, one 30$ souvenir, and we couldn‚Äôt even have a enjoyable time because of the sheer amount of people and people with children too young to enjoy the park. \n\nDue to my experience I would rather never go back again because it‚Äôs just not worth it meanwhile Knotts berry farm and other parks are far more entertaining and a genuinely great experience. \n\nThe price doesn‚Äôt discourage people and Disney knows this so instead they put anything entertaining behind other paywalls to maximize profits.",

This year we are seeing the reverse with folks coming to disneyland to see the new additions of galaxies edge and avengers campus. And disney is celebrating its 50th anniversary so that's a huge draw there. The Halloween event is very popular and this is the one time of year that some folks plan their once a year trip. Christmas is likewise very popular. I also think there is a possibility that disney will increase prices again in January as that's the normal time that they do each year - this may be a push to encourage people to grab tickets now for next year just in case they increase again which just so happens to be just in time for disney to pull profits up after a year of closure on the west coast. With the addition of genie+ and pay per ride lightning lane and parking also going up $5 all coming in during the last quarter, I have no doubt they are trying to make up for profit loss during the last couple of years.

Nobody in southern California seemed to be willing to risk it. Being from the Pacific Northwest, this was optimal summer weather. We had *no* lines at all the second day and zeroed in on our favourite rides and just did them over and over. Walk up to the Matterhorn, walk to the front of the empty queue, board the ride, ride the ride, exit the ride and walk straight back to the front of the line and do it again. And again. And again. We rode so many rides that day that we probably fit a week-long trip into 7-8 hours. Amazing. Couldn‚Äôt imagine better. \n\nOn the third day it was beautiful sunshine and hot. We drove up to the parking lot and saw that it was full to bursting. We looked at each other and said ‚Äúnaaawww‚Äù and we went to the beach instead. Best vacation ever.",

Aussie theme parks like Wonderland (RIP) and Dreamworld were OK, but nothing compared to some of the big ones like 6 flags I had visited in the USA before; but doing a Disneyland stood as one of the big missing things I'd never gotten around to doing.\n\nIn 2019 I was in Japan with my then girlfriend, with the plan to propose. She said yes (yay!), so we're both in the best place mentally, excited to be visting Japan for the first time, and having a great holiday in general. Good times.\n\nWhilst in Tokyo one of the big items on our itenary was Disneyland. Turned out we bought tickets during golden week (a big chinese holiday period). Big mistake.\n\nThe park was COMPETELY packed; queues for every single ride were minumum 2h. The fast pass system they had was no better, and still had 1h queues for that as well. I had never seen anything like it; I was familiar with queuing for like 30m-1h, but this was something else. It was packed, hot, humid, loud, and I was growing very VERY grumpy.\n\nI'll be honest; it was THE worst theme park experience of my life. The rides when we finally got onto them were ok, but shuffling forward a step a time every few minutes, standing in line for hours and hours, only for 10 mins of payoff... it was bloody awful.\n\nEventually I gave up on the rides. We only ended up doing like 3 and it took up most of the day. We found a patch of grass, and instead just tried to salvage the day by watching the parades and firework display.\n\nThings improved somewhat when we gave up on trying to do rides, but it still stands out to me as one of the most dissapointing experiences of my life. I remember being there, watching the fireworks, trying to enjoy the spectacle of it, but having to force it. Years of hype and childhood dreams, dashed againsat an infinite crowd of fellow tourists.",

We did a 3 week road trip from Seattle to Los Angeles, and we thought Disneyland would be one of the Highlights. We payed a lot of money to get in, spent about 1 1/2 hours there (max) and left again. Why? Because it was so full, you could barely walk trought the park, no way to get onto an attraction without waiting for 2h, everything in the Park itself was very expensive and tbh, it was more looks than anything else (sorry if you are a die-hard Disneyland fan, but it just wasn't for us). I am from Europe and most of the theme parks here are way cheaper and you get way more for your money. There is a theme park about 2 hours from where I'm living, where entry is 20‚Ç¨, there are plenty of rides and the queues are a maximum of 15 minutes. I know I know, Disneyland is about Disney, all of the shows and movies, thats what the Park is primarily about, not the rides and a good value for money, but still...If you want to have a fun time and arent that hyped about Disney, dont go to Disneyland, you will regret it especially because it is so damn expensive",
