Vengeance is not the right tool for justice.\n\nEdit: so many people bemoan the inflexible and harsh justice system in this county, and then applaud when that harsh system is used on people they don’t like.\n\nLast edit: I’m not saying they don’t deserve life. I’m saying no one should be sentenced life without the opportunity for parole. Its too open to error. It’s more important that people who end up not really deserving it have a potential remedy than it is to guarantee that we “get” everyone we think does deserve it.
