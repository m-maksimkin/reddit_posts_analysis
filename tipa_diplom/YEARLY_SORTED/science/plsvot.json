If I look at day the UK technical briefing document, which is released weekly I believe and details the UK's most recent data on covid... \n\nPer that data, which I'll link below, the CFR for fully vaccinated people with delta variant is 0.96%. The CFR for unvaccinated people is 0.24%. So when they say 'Moderna is 95% effective at preventing hospitalization', do they mean above a base rate of 0? Or are they comparing to the unvaccinated population? I am assuming it's the former, as the difference in hospitalization appears to be statistically insignificant from real world data, especially in the below 50 population. \n\nSource: https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1014926/Technical_Briefing_22_21_09_02.pdf",

T cell (innate immunity) responses are likely far more important in the long run. The goal isn’t to prevent all infections since that will never happen.
