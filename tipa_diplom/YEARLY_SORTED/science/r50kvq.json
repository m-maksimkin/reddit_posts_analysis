Probation meant they had a deferred sentence and wouldn't go to jail if they followed extra rules and kept out of trouble, or parole meaning they were getting early release from jail if they followed extra rules and kept out of trouble. I dealt exclusively with white people.\n\nOne day I got our first and only black client, and before session I casually asked him if it was hard living in a state that had so few other black people in it. He looked at me weird and said, \"My town is more than half black?\"\n\nMy boss looked over and said \"The state is about ten percent black, but judges think the black offenders are too scary to release back into society, so they have to serve their full sentences. White people get to avoid jail time though.\"\n\nI looked back at my client. He was black, yes, but he was short, slight of build and not at all muscular, exceptionally well groomed (some would say metrosexual), wore expensive and classical glasses, spoke in a \"white\" voice, and was very submissive and agreeable to authorities. I immediately understood why this was the only black client the justice system sent me.\n\nOur society is not a just society.",

The mechanisms do not exist and would be too difficult to manage and maintain. \n\nI think this is the real reason why some people advocate for burning down the whole system. I don’t think that’s a reasonable solution. Essentially, we are faced with two unreasonable solutions. One requires a massive amount of bureaucracy which would cost too much and likely wouldn’t produce meaningful results for years; and the other carries with it the risk of losing our republic. \n\nOr, we can keep things “as is” and simply turn a blind eye to state sanctioned injustice. Since a majority of the victims of these injustices are black and brown, it’s a low priority to the monied interests who profit off of the status quo.",

I find the language of the abstract confusing.  It really does sound as if the authors are suggesting that 11.1% of ALL black men in PA born between 1986 and 1989 end up in solitary confinement by age 32.  But reading the article itself, it looks like they're talking about 11.1% of the cohort group - ~~that is people who are serving time in prison~~.  \n\nI don't know if that's meant to be intentionally misleading, but it is a confusing abstract.\n\nI've now read the whole article twice, and the authors are, in fact, claiming that 11.1% of black men in PA born between 1986 and 1989 have been in solitary confinement.

It definitely shows that there's a huge problem. And honestly it wouldn't surprise me if some of those guys were put in solitary confinement based on the color of their skin and for s**** and giggles of the guards.

Saying that more black people are in solitary confinement more often is not the same as saying black people are more dangerous. Don't get hung up on correlation when you don't have causation. \n\nMy theory is, the majority of black prisoners are impoverished and don't have access to commissary or other luxaries, so in turn, they participate in the politics or dealings in the small hope of improving their situation. \n\nYou normally don't see \"heavies\" or \"bosses\" in solitary.
