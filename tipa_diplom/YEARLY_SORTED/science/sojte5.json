This is HUGE as covid largely enters via lungs and nose, rather than GI (which is still protected by IgA). So by preventing binding we can reduce the amount of virus that has a chance to infect you.  \n\nThis is important because loading dose of a virus matters in whether or not you actually get sick.  If too few copies infect you, the immune system can typically clear it well before a full infection becomes established. Each virus has a different infectious dose and studies will need to be done to prove its efficacy but if it pans out this is a major step forward.\n\nFurther since IgA is local to mucous tissues it’s not a systemic vaccine like the mRNA shot.  So it might go over better with some individuals who are afraid of systemic effects.\n\nMassive progress and here’s to the success of these trials!",

The virus has spread no matter how high the vaccination rate has gotten, even before Omicron.\n\nI think something that can be inhaled or vaporized in the nose could also be more acceptable for vaccine holdouts and for people who fear needles. Though I wonder if the opposite problem might be observed: good protection against infection, not so good against severe forms of the disease if infected nonetheless. If an injected vaccine produces a stronger immune response in the blood that protects organs, but a weaker one in the respiratory tract, might a vaporized vaccine produce a strong reaction in the respiratory tract but a much weaker one in the bloodstream? Which would suggest one dose of the injected vaccine and one dose of the inhaled one might be best?",

And I was wondering why people weren’t questioning when they were trying to down play the effectiveness of natural immunity when the immune systems in recovered patients have obviously been exposed to the whole virus, which logically would mean a more robust response.

The only benefit of it is that the immunity comes sooner than the standard 2 weeks for a injection. I don't know how much sooner but it drops off quickly. In terms of long term systematic immunity it could be the same in injections as in nasal sprays and its really hard to gauge this from a mouse studies because of dose scaling. The other true benefit is having less side effects but this is also more due to vasovagal syncope (fainting from needles) and similar issues than anything from the actual immune response.\n\n2) This uses the adenovirus vector. These have been problematic in this use as we seen already having on average more side effects than the mRNA technology and the fact that they are using a similar vector that has already been used might be problematic for an efficient immune response to the coronavirus spike. The immune system might react to the adenovirus instead of the spike before the spike manages to create a immunity from corona. Because we were exposed to the adenovirus before through Astrazenecas vax but not the COVID virus the immune system might just wipe out the vector before it confers COVID immunity.",
