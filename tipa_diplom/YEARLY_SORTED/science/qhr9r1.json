            "text": " This is a situation when the headline has nothing to do with the abstract:\n\n> Parental child-related spending represents an important pathway to promote children’s human capital development and material well-being. It is also, however, a pathway that perpetuates social inequalities given the well-known socioeconomic divide in parental spending on children. Although several studies have documented the extent to which current family income is associated with spending on children, we still know little about the causal effects of additional income on child-related spending across the socioeconomic strata. In this paper, I examine the effects of income gains due to universal and unconditional cash transfers from the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend on child-related spending. Using longitudinal household expenditure data from the 1996–2015 Consumer Expenditure Surveys, I exploit exogenous variation in the generosity of the Alaska Dividend to estimate short- and long-term disparities in parental expenditures resulting from payouts. Results provide a unique opportunity to compare the behavior of high- and low-income parents after an income boost. I find that low- and middle-income parents use cash transfers to catch up with their more affluent counterparts in the short and long term. Low-income parents are, however, unable to keep up with the long-term increases in child-related spending made by their middle-income counterparts. Implications of results for the reproduction of socioeconomic inequalities and for current and proposed cash-transfer policies are discussed.\n\n A deep dive into the article shows that payments are spent essentially on clothes on electronics, and are **explicitly not spent on education**. I.e. figure 4 shows that the extra dividends are spent on school and pre-school and lessons *only* by middle class parents and *only* if they are above 2k.\n\n However, there is a significant effect in spending on clothes for lower class and (only if the dividends are over 2k) for middle class, and on electronics for lower and middle class if the dividends are over 1200.\n\n Why is the article so screwed, you may ask? You see, the study contains two models: a *long-term model* in Figure 4, which compares Alaska to other US states - and a *short-term model*, which compares payout month (October) to other months. Obviously, since Alaskans are aware of their dividend program, they structure some payments of their own around it. These payments seem to be predominantly child-related, as Figure 3 shows.\n\n The author even acknowledges this:\n\n> Second, figure 4 suggests that greater individual payout generosity is associated with increases in spending on clothes, recreation, lessons, and educational institutions among middle-income Alaskan families relative to middle-income non-Alaskan families. Middle-income Alaskan families always spend more on electronics than other middle-income American families, regardless of payout generosity. These results indicate that Alaskan middle-income families’ aggregate spending on electronics is responsive to payouts of any size, whereas spending on all other categories of spending increases as payouts become more generous. Again, a comparison between long-term (figure 4) and short-term (Table 2) models suggests that some of the increases in spending occur in the months surrounding payouts (electronics, clothing, and education) and some may be smoothed throughout the year (recreation and lessons).\n\n>Overall, **among low-income families, greater individual payout generosity is associated with significant increases in aggregate spending on electronics and recreation only.** Differently than middle-income families, low-income families’ aggregate spending on electronics is only significantly responsive as payouts become more generous. Like middle-income families, low-income Alaskan families likely smooth their spending on recreation throughout the year. On the other hand, short-term increases in spending on education among low-income families (see Table 2) are not reproduced on the long term, which suggests that **spending on education around the time of disbursement may only represent a shift in the timing of expenses that would occur regardless of payouts**. Finally (and unexpectedly), results also indicate that low-income Alaskan families spend more on clothing relative to other US families in years when payouts were less generous, but not in years when the payouts were most generous. Although these results are not robust to alternative model specifications (see Online Appendix), they may also suggest that larger payouts create opportunities for different types of investment and disincentivize investments in clothing among lower-income families.\n\n So, I think this is the case of *extremely bad summary that outright makes points contrary to article's conclusions*.\n\n And, yes, the need for extra spending on clothes in Alaska compared to the rest of USA is kinda obvious.",

I get the tradition of charity in debate, but we've gone beyond the pale in so many ways, it truly does not seem warranted any longer.\n\nBy continuing to offer charity to bad faith arguments, we allow the discussion to be framed by the context of someone who has no real interest in offering a meaningful explanatory theory. Frankly, with most of these policy type discussions, its questionable as to whether the conjectures are ever being made in good faith. There is a seeming that charity is being abused purely for the sake of maintaining a destructive and exploitative world order. It strikes me that we should reconsider with whom we offer charity in these kinds of discussions.",

The findings contradict a common argument in the U.S. that poor parents cannot be trusted to receive cash to use however they want.\r\n\nFirst, why is that last comment in a science study headline?\n\nSecondly, no, that's not the argument. The argument is that *some* will likely abuse it, and therefore they will come back around again demanding further support so no one is left behind. It's a fear of \"the problem\" not actually being addressed even if politically that's what's often presented until the next request is made.\n\nThirdly, even accepting that premise, spending on children doesn't mean that a problem is even being addressed...\n\n> Amorim found that after the lump sum payments, low- and middle-income parents made more education, clothing, recreation and electronic purchases for their children.\n\nWhy lump that all together? Parent bought their kid a video game? Now it can be presented as an increase in education spending? How exactly has \"trust\" been evaluated here when the conclusion isn't even specific? Sure, recreation can be beneficial as well, but drugs are recreational. \n\nFourth, an \"increase\" can literally be $1 of that $7,000 a year for a family of four. Just a completely random dispersement of expenses would arrive at the conclusion that with a constant $7k yearly income, some of such would be used on expenses for children. How is this a study? Why is this being shared?\n\nThe study literally does not contradict that argument because it doesn't establish anything. You don't simply get to say things. The data has to actually prove it.

In other words, even if low-income\nparents take advantage of the lump-sum payouts to purchase clothing, I find no\nevidence that they increase their aggregate spending on clothing over the course\nof the year as payouts increase. This finding suggests that spending on clothing\nmay not be a priority for low-income parents or that low-income parents are\nunable to maintain the gains in spending on clothing made in the short term\nover the course of the year. Finding aggregate increases in spending on clothing\namong middle- and high-income parents, on the other hand, may suggest that\nthese parents prioritize spending on clothing or that Dividend payouts allow\nthem to better prepare for cold winters.\n\n.\n\n> I also find that middle- and low-income parents increase their spending\non electronics both around the disbursement period and over the course of\nthe year.\n\n.\n\n> On the long term, however, low-income parents are unable to “keep up”\nwith the increases in child-related spending made by their middle-income coun\u0002terparts. Specifically, as payout generosity increases, middle-income parents\nincrease aggregate spending on education, lessons, and recreation, but low\u0002income parents only increase aggregate spending on recreation. In other words,\nthe aforementioned short-term increase in spending on education among low\u0002income parents may only represent a shift in the timing of certain educational\nexpenses that would occur regardless of payouts.\n\nI find it odd that they would count investments in electronics (e.g. video games) and recreation as evidence that low-income parents are to be \"trusted\". Even weirder is the notion that because there is a non-zero shift in the spending behavior towards children, this lets us conclude something about the trustworthiness of the parents. There is no comparison made with other types of spending. The only way that this study could change your mind about the benefits of basic income schemes is if you previously thought that low-income parents spend literally nothing on their children when they receive cash.

Surely saving the money for a rainy day is the best option as opposed to immediately spending it.\n\nAlso I'm critical of the conclusion given they used \"middle-income\" parents.

Its purpose to funnel people into a system where they are dependent on the system. If you have nothing and you pump out some kids it will elevate your lifestyle somewhat which was the major catalyst that started this in the first place. However once you are on it, it's very difficult to get off because you mostly fall back down to rock bottom again as you lose all benefits should you try to elevate your position in society. Over time this scaled to a large portion of people becoming ignorant because they have to stay limited, dependent, irresponsible because they dont need to be responsible and especially in modern times envious mixed with entitlement because everyone's a victim. A story I read about a man who worked for a county welfare office said that before, when people would come in to get their checks for whatever reason they would be thankful, grateful and always be polite and courteous and try and get off assistance as soon as possible and most did. 20 or 30 years later he said people would come in and scream and yell at him to give them their motha f***in check and to hurry up. These people often never stopped coming in. Said it really hurt him to see what became of everything. A far better system for the people would be to give people assistance based on their specific circumstances while encouraging growth and contribution to society and reduce the assistance as they rise up the financial ladder.",
