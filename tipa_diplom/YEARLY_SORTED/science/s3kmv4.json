    "If Americans swapped one serving of beef per day for chicken, their diets’ greenhouse gas emissions would fall by average of 48% and water-use impact by 30%. Also, replacing a serving of shrimp with cod reduced greenhouse emissions by 34%; replacing dairy milk with soymilk resulted in 8% reduction.\n": [

As with the production of all foods, the production of beef results in GHG emissions; however, direct emissions from the U.S. beef industry are only estimated to be 1.9 percent of the total U.S. GHG emissions. Thus, even without consideration of the unintended consequences and impacts of alternative protein sources, completely removing beef from the U.S. diet would likely have a minimal impact on GHG emissions. However, as historical progress has demonstrated (GHG emissions per pound of beef have been reduced 9 to 16 percent since the 1970s), there are opportunities to reduce beef’s impact, chief among them being reducing consumer waste.\n\nSource https://extension.okstate.edu/fact-sheets/the-impact-of-consuming-beef-on-greenhouse-gas-emissions.html",

That means we could rewild the other 75% back to carbon-sequestering forest and grassland.\n\nI’m prepared to provide sources on any of the above if requested. Align your actions with your ethics. Stop making excuses. You know we need drastic action to fight climate change. Going vegan is a tiny step that can make a huge difference, especially if you also get involved in activism to multiply your impact.

The term \"carbon footprint\" was popularized by BP.\n\n[Is Your Carbon Footprint BS? by How to Save a Planet](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/xjh53gn)\n\nThe above episode considers both sides of the carbon footprint debate.\n\n\nAlex: [laughs] I love doing the math. We compared the average American's carbon footprint to the overall amount of carbon emissions globally. And remember, average American, pretty big footprint, 16 tons. Overall global emissions, 50 billion tons.\n\n\nAyana: Yeah.\n\n\nAlex: What this means is that the average American's contribution to the total global problem is 0.0000000003. That is a decimal point and then nine zeros and then a three. And statistically ...\n\n\nAyana: That's basically zero. [laughs]\n\n\nAlex: It rounds to zero. [laughs] So individually, I think the math would suggest that we have zero impact on the larger problem.\n\n\nAyana: And as professor Dr. Leah Stokes, who's been on the show before puts it, even if you are the perfect, zero-waste, low-carbon footprint human being, that doesn't change the world unless you do something bigger than yourself. Because if you disappear tomorrow, we would still be facing exactly the same magnitude of climate crisis because you're just a rounding error to global carbon emissions.\n\n\nAlex: And this might make certain people feel sad and maybe hopeless and defeated but, you know, Ayana, you and I talked with Katharine Wilkinson about this, and we actually think it is good news. Because it means, if you change the systems, then you're changing millions of people's carbon footprints without them having to do anything.\n\n\nKatharine Wilkinson: My feeling is, thank goddess we don't have to rely on every individual getting everything right in their own lives, because New Year's resolutions don't even last a month, you know? [laughs]\n\n---\n\nThe pro carbon footprint side:\n\n\nAlex: So aligning your actions with your values is part of it, right? But Katharine and a lot of the experts we spoke to about the importance of individual actions emphasized this one thing: you have to think of those actions outside the scope of just lowering your own carbon footprint. You know, because If you're focused only on reducing your own emissions from, you know, I don't know, 16 tons to 12 tons a year, you know, being the best climate gold star sticker winner you can be, you're having a negligible effect.\n\n\nAyana: But if you instead think about your actions as a form of communication, as an invitation for others to join you, then your action can lead to other actions that can actually lead to change. One great example of this is the trend around flying in Europe.\n\n...\n\nAnd he found [in a nonrandom sample] that yes, 75 percent of the people he surveyed who knew somebody who gave up flying said they also changed their own attitudes about flying and climate change, and about half of them actually started flying less themselves.\n\n...\n\nAlex: And the fact that these policy changes are being discussed are, at least in some way, due to the actions, individual actions that people took. But it wasn't just taking these actions, it was also communicating about the actions. It was sharing it with their friends, and getting them to take the actions too. And that is the key. **The communication, that has to be part of the action. The action's important, but it's the talking about it that gives it power.**\n\nAnthony Leiserowitz: And that's one of the single most important things that anyone, anyone can do. When people say, \"What can I do about climate change?\" My answer first and foremost is talk about it.\n\n---\n\nMy take on climate change is it should be a one-two punch, especially if you are economically able to make changes in your own life. If you are the kind of person who wants to drive less or eat less meat, great, but please tell your friends and family that you're scared to death of climate change and that's why you're doing it. And if you can't make changes for some reason, it is **far, far, far** more effective to get industry-level or city-level changes like [upgrading the heating for apartments and large buildings](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/mehklx8/breaking-buildings-addiction-to-fossil), changing to [regenerative farming practices](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/76hmbge/soil-the-dirty-climate-solution), or doing what [28 Nobel Laureate Economists and others have recommended](https://www.econstatement.org/), enacting a carbon rebate which prices in the social cost of carbon.

This paper looks like its goal is to influence dietary habits rather than have any beneficial influence on the environment.  \n  \nEdit: I remembered the other reason why these studies blaming CC on beef are such trash.  The carbon ipact is nothing compared to fossil fuels.  The use of oil and coal release old stores of carbon that do not readily cycle back through to oil and coal.  Whereas with beef and grass there is a relatively short cycle between the carbon fermented from vegetable matter by ruminants going into the air to become carbon gas that is sequestered again from plants.

Transportation accounts for 29% of US ghg. You would probably have a more material impact by reducing your emissions related to transportation. Public transit, hybrid vehicles, EVs, carpooling, reducing flights, etc will be more beneficial for the environment. \n\nWe are also ignoring the fact that the solution of eliminating cows is shortsighted. The US was home to roughly 60 million Bison at its apex, and probably 10 million other ungulates. So maybe 70 million animals before we extirpated them and replaced them with 90 million cattle. Not exactly 1 for 1 but I think we are barking up the wrong tree here. Animals would have always contributed to climate change whether we eat them or not. We need to look in the mirror here and stop scapegoating. \n\nSource:\n\nhttps://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions\n\nhttps://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/rangelands/article/viewFile/11258/10531",
