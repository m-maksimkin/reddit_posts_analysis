The research is published in the May 5, 2021, online issue of Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The findings applied to people with moderate to severe strokes, not people with mild strokes.\n\nThe study looked at abnormal proteins called amyloid and tau. Amyloid is a protein that forms into plaques, while tau is a protein that forms into tangles. Both are found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease but may also be found in the brains of older people with normal cognition.\n\nThe Mediterranean diet includes high intake of vegetables, legumes, fruits, cereals, fish and monounsaturated fatty acids such as olive oil, and low intake of saturated fatty acids, dairy products and meat.\n\n“Our study suggests that eating a diet that’s high in unsaturated fats, fish, fruits and vegetables, and low in dairy and red meat may actually protect your brain from the protein build-up that can lead to memory loss and dementia,” said study author Tommaso Ballarini, Ph.D., of the German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE) in Bonn, Germany. “These results add to the body of evidence that show what you eat may influence your memory skills later on.”\n\nThe study looked at 512 people. Of those, 169 were cognitively normal, while 343 were identified as being at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nResearchers looked at how closely people followed the Mediterranean diet based on their answers to a questionnaire asking how much they ate of 148 items over the previous month. People who often ate healthy foods typical of the Mediterranean diet, like fish, vegetables and fruit, and only occasionally ate foods non-typical of the Mediterranean diet, like red meat, received the highest scores, for a maximum score of nine.\n\nCognitive skills were assessed with an extensive test set for Alzheimer’s disease progression that looked at five different functions, including language, memory and executive function. All the participants had brain scans to determine their brain volume. In addition, the spinal fluid of 226 was tested for amyloid and tau protein biomarkers.\n\nResearchers then looked at how closely someone followed the Mediterranean diet, and the relationship to both their brain volume, tau and amyloid biomarkers, and cognitive skills.\n\nAfter adjusting for factors like age, sex and education, researchers found that in the area of the brain most closely associated with Alzheimer’s disease, every point lower people scored on the Mediterranean diet scale was equal to almost one year of brain aging.\n\nhttps://n.neurology.org/content/early/2021/05/04/WNL.0000000000012067",

Hers was the most rigorous attempt ever made, but ultimately she concluded that the project of identifying a Mediterranean diet was an “impossible enterprise, since data are lacking, incomplete, or too aggregated.” The all-embracing term “Mediterranean diet,” “while very attractive,” she wrote, “should not be used in scientific literature, until its composition, both in foods, nutrients and non-nutrients, is more clearly defined.”'\n\nExcerpt From: Nina Teicholz. “The Big Fat Surprise.”",

I just really hate seeing \"this diet does ______ find out how?!\" Only to find out later it causes cancer and digestive issues later...\n\nI mean fish is important but like where I am if I want fresh fish that hasn't been shipped inland I will have to catch it myself and almost all the fish in my area are laden with mercury. Like they're edible but a heavy local trout, bass, catfish would be detrimental because of the build up of mercury you would incur.\n\nAs for olive oil it's pretty much the only oil I use.",
