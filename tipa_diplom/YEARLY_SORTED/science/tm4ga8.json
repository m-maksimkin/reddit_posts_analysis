I used to believe that, all John Dewey education fixes everything. My belief started having cracks during the Bush admin and now, at 75, it has been completely demolished. Showing people facts does not change their view on politics, racism or vaccines. \n\nAnyway, I think that once many libs (as in my case) realize they still have enormous gaps in their knowledge they seek to correct that as best they can whereas Republicans just build stronger walls around their brains.",

We extended the Marley hypothesis by testing whether it explains political differences in perception of racism among White Americans in the United States. Two preregistered studies measured participants’ knowledge of historical racism as well as their perception of present racism in individual cases and in society (N = 463). White Republicans had less knowledge of historical racism and perceived less individual and systemic racism than White Democrats. Consistent with the Marley hypothesis, political differences in perception of individual racism were significantly mediated by knowledge of historical racism. These findings suggest that ignorance of historical racism may partly explain why White Republicans perceive less racism than White Democrats, and therefore extend the Marley hypothesis to the political realm.",

There's also a direct correlation between the most intolerant/racist states and their ranking in literacy and education. If you look at the states the rank the lowest in education, they're also the least diverse with a lengthy history of racism.\n\nI went to Jamestown, which was the last known place in the US to host a lynching, and it's exactly what you'd imagine a \"little Kentucky\" to be. I learned very quickly that ignorance, racism, and hatred are means of comfort and convenience similar to the way Bible thumpers think, which is also correlated. Ironically, they represent everything they're not supposed to be according to the scripture they preach because they don't actually believe in anything that isn't within their comfort zone. No demographic is more harmful to the general welfare of a nation and it's people as ignorant fanatics are and  historically the leading cause of every travesty we've ever experienced.\n\nPolitics, religion, and ignorance have been integrated into every dictatorship throughout history as a control mechanism, which is precisely why the first amendment exists. Whenever you see the elements of the ignorance trifecta, the powers that be are being very comfortable at everyone else's expense which is precisely why dictatorships do everything they can to maintain it.",

Thirteen percent of respondents — and \"nearly 20 percent of Trump supporters,\" the Times reports, compared with 5 percent of Marco Rubio's — said they disapproved of it.\n\nIt gets even worse. An additional 17 percent of respondents said they weren't sure.\n\nBefore asking about slavery, YouGov first asked two broader poll questions about executive orders: Do you approve of them, and do you think they're constitutional? Then they asked about specific presidential actions, including freeing the slaves, desegregating the military, interning Japanese Americans during World War II, and deferring deportation for some unauthorized immigrants.\n\nFraming the question this way is a reminder that one of Lincoln's greatest acts, and a turning point in American history, was also a controversial exercise of presidential power.

Virginia.\n\nBraun, the junior senator from Indiana, made his comments during a media call in which he argued that policy issues should generally be left in the hands of state governments whenever possible, especially in the case of abortion.\n\n“So you would be OK with the Supreme Court leaving the question of interracial marriage to the states?” a reporter asked.\n\n“Yes,” Braun answered. “I think that that’s something that if you’re not wanting the Supreme Court to weigh in on issues like that, you’re not going to be able to have your cake and eat it too.

Poor and working class whites generally don't live in cities. Those towns are dying cause they don't have any infrastructure, the factories are moved out, their farms are decimated by funding priorities going to large scale farming owned by the rich and now one of the only industries left - hauling - that brings them truckers and employs their people is gonna die.Nothing replaced oil trucking when the pipelines were laid. Nothing replaced the small factories holding up towns. Ain't no therapists and social workers. Cant get home care out there for the elderly and People with disabilities. \n\nResentment is very high.

And also white poverty is nearly completely ignored as an issue that needs to be reckoned with. There are more destitute and on the brink white families that there are stable white families. Stats we use hide that cause they don't look at the spectrum of whiteness. The wealthy oligarchs being mostly white skews the stats so far that white suffering is obliterated off the map. \n\nResentment of having your way of life killed off - of having to relocate from generations of belonging or succumb to poverty, drug abuse, over incarceration, over policy by child services, lack of health and mental health care, etc - breeds hatred. If you tell a clearly oppressed group that their privilege is greater than their suffering you're gonna end up making it really easy to propagandize them and turn them vicious. \n\nMLK, Jr realized that white poor people are the ally in the economic spectrum to black people, that's how the poor peoples campaign started. Malcolm X realized it at the end of his life after going to Mecca. That the upper middle class whites who paid for much of the early civil rights movement abandoned the movement when it turned to economic rights and true integration. Because they were only the ally in their empathy of the violence being done to black people and the restriction of voting and access to public space. They are not the ally for economic Justice because they cannot empathize because they haven't lived it. They don't \"know\" it. \n\nStats show that more impvrished whites are jailed, killed by police, and starved out, evicted, in foreclosure than blacks. By states of full population? No. But by numbers yes. And that matters. Because they are constantly told that they are not in economic danger. And that these things are not really happening to them. And that is not true. It paints an erroneous picture for both the left and the right.  It makes the left the enemy even though the progressive movement is the only thing that can save them. \n\nEveryone needs to remember that division by race and resentment are tools. They aren't accidents. If you control the news and media you control the people. Just look around. Left media will make people paranoid about white poor and average folks. Right media will make people paranoid about black, brown and immigrant people. That is because racial differences and slightly skewed stratification along lines of difference and paranoia of others makes it easy to get the lower classes to fight each other. Then the rich have very little to do besides send out memes\nFor us to share and help our friends and family also get more paranoid that the \"other\" instead of the \"wealthy\" is the reason for our suffering. \n\nTo counter this takes seeing each other's humanity and the effect of propaganda and that's painful.

Thus, we designed a set of studies to directly test this hypothesis.”\n\n-study author Ethan Zell, an associate professor of psychology at UNC Greensboro.\n\n\nThe author suspected a correlation between knowledge about historical racism and perceived racism in the US. ... Which honestly doesn't seem like a stretch.\n\nMethod\n\n>The researchers used the crowdsourcing platforms Prolific and Amazon Mechanical Turk to survey 463 White American adults regarding their knowledge about Black history in the United States and their perceptions of racism. The participants completed a Black History Quiz in which they indicated whether they believed 16 statements were true or false and reported the certainty of their response.\n\nAlthough the article provides two examples of questions, the full 16 are not disclosed. There is no discussion in the article of how many of each type of question was presented or whether the groups had different tendencies to make Type I vs Type II errors. I only mention this because it's possible Democrats and Republicans have different biases, such that Ds would perform worse on TF questions describing instances of racism that *did not* actually occur and Rs would perform worse on questions describing racist events that *did* in fact occur. It would interesting to see the split between these two question types in the actual survey.\n\nTest for perceived racism\n\n>...those who scored lower on the Black History Quiz were more likely to rate the following statement as not being indicative of racism: “Several people walk into a restaurant at the same time. The server attends to all the White customers first. The last customer served happens to be the only person of color.”\n\nI imagine there are better ways to test this, for example, ask respondents the same question(s) presented in the Pew Research mentioned above.\n\nConclusions\n\n>...the researchers cannot say for certain that historical ignorance causes people to downplay or deny racism. “More studies in larger samples are needed,” Zell explained. “Further, our studies are not experiments (we did not manipulate historical knowledge), so it remains unclear whether historical knowledge has a causal effect on perception of present racism.”\n\nThe study *only* detects a correlation and *did not attempt to identify a causal link.* Not surprisingly, the title of the article oversells the conclusions of the study, but at least they hedged with \"may partly explain\".",

Meaning; we want to paint republicans as \"racist\" and democrats as saviors. The truth is, both are racist but in different ways. On the republican side there is the real racist, though I believe not many it does make up some part of their party. These are the few that still use the \"N\" word while in private company. Then there are the much larger group of ambivalents which I was probably part of for a long time.  They just don't care enough to even think about while not harboring any group ill will. On the democrat side you have a little or a lot of both of those groups but you also have the compassionate racists. The group I believe is rather large and they consists of those that believe that some minorities need help because they can't help themselves. They won't say it, but they believe blacks in particular to be less able to succeed not because of circumstance but because they don't believe them to be equal. These conversations happen but they are careful not to really let it out in most company. I believe this to be the most dangerous form of racism as it can permeate through society and then to black people themselves ruining confidence.",

It really wasn’t until the 1960s that this all started to change and the Democrats started trying to reverse a lot of this. Republicans meanwhile were sort of spectators in all this, and while they certainly didn’t do enough to fight racism during this period (for example Republican President Rutherford B. Hayes infamously betrayed his black constituents for the sake of getting the White House) they didn’t do nearly as much damage as Democrats did.
