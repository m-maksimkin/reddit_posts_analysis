Providing this compelling evidence is motivation for women to continue breastfeeding after they receive the vaccine.”\n\nNarayanaswamy notes another important takeaway: the antibodies were detected in infants regardless of age – from 1.5 months old to 23 months old.\n\nhttps://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/Fulltext/9900/Neutralizing_Antibodies_and_Cytokines_in_Breast.339.aspx",
