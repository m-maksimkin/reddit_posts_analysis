This can be rewritten to perform a new command such as creating anti bodies against the Coronavirus. Then that said altered version is replicated by the cells continously until all cells have the same MRNA strain of information. This does affect the DNA inside the nucleus  for aid in fighting future infections. One example is that studies from the CDC And Isreal show younger men who have been vaccinated have higher chances of developing heart conditions or enlarged heart due to the vaccine. The exact mutation of DNA that correlates to the exact formation of said conditions which are being studied show that without the vaccine this type of damage to the DNA chain \"I think 8RNA\" is not possible in the cell unless the nucleus has been instructed with what's called Insertion process of DNA. So how would studies show from CDC and Isreal, that young men can and are at low numbers, developing these conditions which are only caused when the DNA chain becomes damaged inside of the cells. It is the creation of permanent conditions from the vaccine that otherwise with Time and replication  would have been replaced by new cells as the vaccines protection wore off. Since the new cells eventually wouldn't have that blueprint from the MRNA vaccine, they shouldn't also have the damage in the nucleus as the previous cells had.",

How do these covid vaccs compare against the measles and HEP abc vaccs as they have been around for years?\nCovid has a 95% survival rate yet people are are acting like this is Ebola.\ni know everyone on mainstream says its safe and they've done testing but at the end of the day its still a provisional vaccine approved for emergency use. They cant test for the long term side effects because the only thing that can prove that is time. This is my worry. \n\nNormally we're told to be so cautious and think critically about this type of stuff, but as soon as you say \"im not too sure about this\" everyone's like \"wow what an idiot\".\nPlease enlighten me?",
