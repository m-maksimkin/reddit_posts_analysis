Specimens were obtained from two men with a history of COVID-19 infection and two men with no history of infection. Specimens were imaged with TEM and H&E staining. RT-PCR was performed from corpus cavernosum biopsies. The tissues collected were analyzed for endothelial Nitric Oxide Synthase (eNOS, a marker of endothelial function) and COVID-19 spike-protein expression. Endothelial progenitor cell (EPC) function was assessed from blood samples collected from COVID-19 (+) and COVID-19 (−) men.  \n>  \n>**Results**  \n>  \n>TEM showed extracellular viral particles \\~100 nm in diameter with peplomers (spikes) near penile vascular endothelial cells of the COVID-19 (+) patients and absence of viral particles in controls. PCR showed presence of viral RNA in COVID-19 (+) specimens. eNOS expression in the corpus cavernosum of COVID-19 (+) men was decreased compared to COVID-19 (−) men. Mean EPC levels from the COVID-19 (+) patients were substantially lower compared to mean EPCs from men with severe ED and no history of COVID-19.  \n>  \n>**Conclusions**  \n>  \n>Our study is the first to demonstrate the presence of the COVID-19 virus in the penis long after the initial infection in humans. Our results also suggest that widespread endothelial cell dysfunction from COVID-19 infection can contribute to ED. Future studies will evaluate novel molecular mechanisms of how COVID-19 infection leads to ED.",

COVID virus can enter the endothelial cells - cells that line the blood vessels supplying blood to the penis \n2. Endothelial dysfunction, typically present in men with COVID could be a common denominator for erectile dysfunction \n3. COVID19 is NOT sexually transmitted since it is absent in the semen among men who have recovered - our previous study ([https://wjmh.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5534/wjmh.200192](https://wjmh.org/DOIx.php?id=10.5534/wjmh.200192)) \n\nWhat we don't know \n\n1. Whether the severity of erectile dysfunction is associated with the severity of COVID \n2. The true prevalence of erectile dysfunction among COVID survivors \n\nWhat should men do \n\nMen who develop erectile dysfunction after COVID should discuss with their doctor if the symptoms persist to discuss treatment options since ED may be due to underlying vascular disease rather than psychological causes. Obviously, do everything possible to avoid getting infected. Email me - ramasamy at [miami.edu](https://miami.edu) for further questions",
