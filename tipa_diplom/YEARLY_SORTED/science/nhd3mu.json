He was at the ski hill the next day and shared joints and booze with another farmer. Then on Tuesday we all packed into a van (seven of us) and we drove to a remote location which takes a few hours. Which, by the way, the driver is not required to wear a mask because there is a shower curtain hanging, fortunately the rest of us do. After that more than ten but less than twenty of us ride a crew boat to our sites and we all wear a mask because I guess there is no way for the operator to hang a silly clear shower curtain.\n\nWe get to the site and we have a regular work day. After Wednesday working he felt symptoms, and started to be concerned he was sick. That night he had a huge fever and unable to sleep. Out of caution my boss drove him home in his truck. He was careless and had a few smokes on the ride and even picked up fast food for dinner in civilization before he returned. So he did take his mask off periodically. Sick guy left his on.\n\nFew days later we received the news that he tested positive. Which of course triggered panic etc. Lots of other things happened not worth for you all to read me vent, but it was awful. Anyways, the result was that only the  Covidien had it, no one else did including the bus driver or joint smoker (he didn't have the viral load yet to shed) \n\nMasks work and saved me from getting sick and running the risk. The only thing that spared me from getting it was that he had symptoms so his shedding was reduced. My partner at home would have certainly died. I am still upset about this episode that happened to me in February.",
