That comes down to about 140 million a year (assuming even distribution, which I know is not correct). Assuming 4.7 million is an annual figure, it still sounds like less than a 5% deviation from a 50/50 boy-girl ratio, which is [pretty much on-par with the natural ratio.](https://ourworldindata.org/gender-ratio)\n\nI realize it also says 95% of \"missing\" girl births are in India and China, but these two countries have a combined population of 2.7 billion people right now. 4.7 million is like 0.17% of the population.\n\nSo while the practice is absolutely abysmal, I'm not sure it really has as much as a socio-economic impact as people are thinking?",
