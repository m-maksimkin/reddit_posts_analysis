    "A research team trained people to use a robotic extra thumb and found they could effectively carry out dextrous tasks, like building a tower of blocks, with one hand. The researchers report that participants trained to use the thumb also increasingly felt like it was a part of their body.\n": [

It has aimed to restore capabilities to that of an fairly average person. \n\nWe're quickly approaching augmentative medicine though. Things like mind-computer interfaces, genetic engineering, and the like will still be restorative, but will also be able to take a person who is already at average capability and improve it beyond that.\n\nIt could be said that physical training for athletes or education for students does the same thing, but that isn't something that's simply purchasable; It takes both money and training. Once someone can simply pay for increased physical capability, better mental prowess, new organs, whatever, then there's a whole new societal conversation to be had.\n\nLiberal democracy and the values it promotes are partially based on the idea that all people are equal, everyone has an equal opportunity, and each individual is responsible for their own success.* We've already made opportunity unequal with the way that wealth and resources are distributed. But what happens once there are very real measurable differences in mental and physical capability between the rich who can afford to buy augmentations or genetically engineered children, and everyone else?\n\nAt that point, \"All men are created equal,\" is no longer true. Those with money will be created differently, or made more capable through their wealth. When this technology develops, we'll have to tackle the problems it will create while we also celebrate the advances we'll see. \n\n*I have some major reservations about the differences between the promises and realities of liberalism and capitalism, but I'm using their claimed values for this case.",
