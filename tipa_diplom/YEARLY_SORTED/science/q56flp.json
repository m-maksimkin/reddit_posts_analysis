These are totally related.

Or 'but man always ate meat' nonsense comments.\n\nIt's so surprising how quickly someone goes from 'I love animals' to trolling someone who doesn't want to eat them cos they also love animals and don't want to kill them... and how easily triggered some people are at the mention of the word 'vegan'.\n\nIf there were a way to isolate these factors in future studies, it would be fascinating. From other areas and other notes, it definitely seems the social aspect is what causes any vegan-related anxiety and depression so far. Aside from the constant horror of seeing meat everywhere. Imagine you lived in a world where people routinely cooked and ate their pets. That's the best equivalent I can see on that. Imagine the horror if someone came to your home, took your dog, hung it upside-down, slit its throat, and cooked it for your dinner. And not only was it totally legal, it was actually illegal to try and stop them.\n\nWould be good to find some studies looking at that side of it and the cause of that depression/anxiety further.",

While most places usually have at least a burger or something so it's easy for a meat eater to find something, that's not the case for vegetarians. It may seem like a minor thing but I know due to other reasons, that constantly being reminded that the society we live in has little consideration for you takes a toll on one's mental health. That and the feeling of being an inconvenience to other people because of that reason is a really upsetting feeling. Someone who has been on a purely vegan/vegetarian diet for a long time also often can't just decide to eat meat either as it will literally make them sick since their stomach adapted to their diet. And the fact that a lot of stuff is labeled vegetarian when it's actually not can be really stressful because if they're not careful, seemingly unassuming foods will also make them sick.

This may translate into greater general anxiety and/or depression induced by increased attention to social imbalances. I am not a psychologist so perhaps someone with that experience could chime in and provide more concrete examples.",

My point is that people who chose to be vegans have also made/taken many such choices/stands where they get affected by the status quo and that might be the reason for the increased anxiety. Of course all of this is just speculation from an amateur's lenses.\n\nNow the same might not be said of vegetarians because a majority of people who are vegetarians are because of religious reasons, and not mainly concern for animals.

In June 2020, we searched five online databases for primary studies examining differences in depression and anxiety between meat abstainers and meat consumers that offered a clear (dichotomous) distinction between these groups. Twenty studies met the selection criteria representing 171,802 participants with 157,778 meat consumers and 13,259 meat abstainers. We calculated the magnitude of the effect between meat consumers and meat abstainers with bias correction (Hedges’s g effect size) where higher and positive scores reflect better outcomes for meat consumers. Meat consumption was associated with lower depression (Hedges’s g = 0.216, 95% CI [0.14 to 0.30], p < .001) and lower anxiety (g = 0.17, 95% CI [0.03 to 0.31], p = .02) compared to meat abstention. Compared to vegans, meat consumers experienced both lower depression (g = 0.26, 95% CI [0.01 to 0.51], p = .041) and anxiety (g = 0.15, 95% CI [-0.40 to 0.69], p = .598). Sex did not modify these relations. Study quality explained 58% and 76% of between-studies heterogeneity in depression and anxiety, respectively. The analysis also showed that the more rigorous the study, the more positive and consistent the relation between meat consumption and better mental health. The current body of evidence precludes causal and temporal inferences.\n\n~ Dobersek, U., Teel, K., Altmeyer, S., Adkins, J., Wy, G. and Peak, J., 2021.

Meat-eaters tend towards being less neurotic than vegetarians or vegans (neuroticism being how prone you are to negative emotions)—a possible way of testing this would be to screen people with the Big Five personality tests.\n2. Having to restrict diet makes people more anxious or depressed. This could be tested by taking groups of meat-eaters without dietary restrictions, doing one group that stays without dietary restrictions, one group who doesn’t eat meat, and one group that doesn’t eat gluten and/or dairy or something like that. While it would be hard probably to make sure that the dietary restrictions group keeps a balanced diet, if the meat and food-restrictions group report feeling more depressed than the meat-eating group with no differences between the vegetarian and dietary restriction then restricting the diet may be a causal factor. (Not a super well-designed study but whatever).",

A lot of comments on this thread about how the data can be interpreted differently shouldn't be ignored, but when you look at people who *only* eat meat you see some really crazy correlations and experiences that  make you question what you know about nutrition.\n\nThis is a great comment I read and I'll leave it here:\n\n\"This ended up being longer than I intended, feel free to read or not.\n\nNeurogastroenterology is a prominent rising field. The enteric nervous system is in your digestive tract and has more neurons than your spinal cord. It’s also where 90% of serotonin is produced, and around half of dopamine. The primal gut feeling or “knowing something in your gut isn’t right” isn’t just a saying or coincidence. Particular disorders such as ASD are frequently associated with chronic general digestive comorbities like IBS despite an unclear true origin of the disorder in and of itself.\n\nA lot of people who have depression/anxiety are insulted by the potential of a diet change being helpful to their condition as if it’s a slap in the face. People are told over and over that it’s a neurological imbalance and medication can fix it with no qualms, but you suggest a dietary change that also affects physiology greatly without the major potential side effects of the drug (loss of libido, insomnia, brain zaps should you choose to stop) and everyone loses their minds.\n\nI’ve been diagnosed with dysthymia and MDD known as “double depression” previously in life, along with anxiety. I’ve experimented with prescriptions and they did not work for me both because the side effects were not worth the benefit which is of course unique to me singularly but also I took issue at an ideological level more broadly. I felt like ameliorating symptoms was not an effective way to combat the root cause of the condition(s) themselves. I thought to myself even if there were a ‘miracle drug’ that helped me, it felt at best ok as a temporary placeholder for the severity of symptoms, but inauthentic as a long-term solution to what is caused in large part by my own actions and inactions. In other words, the idea that you have to make change to see change.\n\nEveryone seems so caught up in the idea of their uniqueness, as if your habits have no real impact beyond how you just want to define yourself or project yourself to others. That’s not how health works. What you consume, how often you’re physically active, how much you put yourself out there and take risks, etc. are are vital predictors of healthy self-esteem. People with low self-esteem often obsess over minutiae to the point that they feel like they can’t even live a normal life because of so many missed opportunities and feelings of failure and rejection. To me, low carb/zero carb is the most effective way of settling these issues because at bare minimum the practice of discipline helps you realize consistency and results is not the same as perfection. But beyond that, the nutritional benefit is something that if you experience for yourself you simply cannot deny, even if you don’t suffer from mental illness. Having what honestly feels like a base level emotion of elation sounds hyperbolic, but is something I don’t think you can experience without a low carb lifestyle, and only gets better with zero carb.\n\nA lot of people don’t want to look too hard in the mirror because it’s easier to assume your problems aren’t all your fault. For what it’s worth, most people have been woefully misled about what constitutes a healthy human diet. But a cheap, easy fix always has a bigger cost down the road; it often exacerbates the issue because the origins are untouched in place of mere symptom management and you’re left with a lifetime of choosing the right cocktail to mask the symptoms that are there in the first place, for a reason, letting you know something is amiss.\"\n\nhttps://reddit.com/r/zerocarb/comments/ajcmme/_/eeuloyc/?context=1",

There could be many variables to why vegetarians are on a whole more depressed, and it could absolutely be eating meat itself, but we can't jump to that conclusion, and most people seeing this headline will absolutely do so. It could even be the way they checked for depression was faulty as well.\n\nIf I was to jump to conclusions and give my bet, vegetarians generally are more socially aware or more fringe societally; the world also doesn't cater to them, and if they are a vegan for moral reasons they may feel depression over the system. Anecdotally I've known several vegans and some are even suicidal, they just have a general bad outlook on the world, and even when they're kept well together they usually keep to themselves and don't hang out etc due to things like food choices.",

Thats not to say you can’t eat a balanced diet while vegan, but my understanding is you have to know what you are doing  to make sure you are getting everything you need. One essential amino acid is tryptophan, which is used to synthesize serotonin, so a tryptophan deficit could cause low serotonin. Low serotonin is associated with depression and anxiety. \n\nMy intuition is that there is likely a physiological cause, and its not just that vegans worry nonstop about climate change.

When you consider the fact that our brains require animal fat and protein to properly function it’s a no brainer. \n\n“Current epidemiological data support the need for animal-derived nutrients to provide optimal brain health, in particular. For example, B12 and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids essential for the development of a healthy brain are concentrated only in animal products. Excluding animal products from your diet, on the other hand, carries significant risk. A recent survey of 689 men found 52 percent of the 122 vegans were vitamin B12 deficient, which leads to fatigue, depression, decreased cognition, and irreversible nerve damage. As we age, low B12 levels are associated with shrinkage in brain regions related to memory and moods.” \n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/diagnosis-diet/201903/the-brain-needs-animal-fat\n\nhttps://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-farmacy/201205/do-happy-healthy-brains-need-meat",

Michalak et al found evidence for elevated prevalence rates in vegetarians not only for somatoform syndromes but also for depressive disorders, anxiety disorders as well as for eating disorders. This is the only study that did not rely on self-report but used clinical diagnoses of mental disorders as assessed with standardized diagnostic interviews and that controlled for socio-demographic characteristics. For depressive, anxiety and somatoform disorders the adoption of a vegetarian diet followed the onset of mental disorders and the authors hypothesized that a mental disorder increases the likelihood of choosing a vegetarian diet probably with the goal to positively influence the course of the disease”([Source of study discussed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22676203/?dopt=Abstract))([Source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63910-y))",

It's whether or not we should have to stuff animals in cages for years and then boil them alive because the equipment at the slaughterhouse is 50 years old. The reality of the meat industry I can't even describe, and I grew up listening to death metal. It's worse then any cannibal corpse song. There are better ways but profits are what is most important.
