Rather than promoting an immune reaction that targets cancerous cells. It's kind of like having your body produce a drug rather than taking a pill. What makes the mRNA vaccines so interesting is that it has our bodies producing its own proteins. This means that we might be able to inject people with mRNA to induce our bodies to produce missing proteins or bad proteins. I know some diseases are associated with bad proteins (a lot of genetic things would fall under this) like sickle cell anemia which is related to badly formed hemoglobin. I wonder if mRNA could open up an avenue to treat or cure these diseases without requiring DNA manipulation.\n\nNot something I had really thought of when reading about the tech but it makes perfect sense. Combined with all the research that's going into quantum computing that will allow us to simulate proteins more quickly (think folding@home on super steroids)... It could lead to a revolution in new drugs and treatments when we can create designer proteins and be able to quickly and easily create new mRNA treatments to get our bodies to produce the proteins.
