Then they’d go lay in their water trough for a bit and roll around in the mud they made. And their hair is like the same consistency as those plastic wire brushes for cleaning.. that surprised me. But those pigs grew up outside on a big farm so not super socialized to humans or anything.

Automatic identification of noises that humans believe pigs will make when distressed.

I.e. Do pigs have regional accents and/or make different enough sounds in different places such that the model performance drops significantly when you try to use it somewhere else?\nFarmers are probably also interested in outlier cases where something out of the ordinary is picked up. It might be best to augment the classifier predictions with other methods that can flag those outliers.\n\nI'm sure the researchers know all of this but we should be careful how the media portrays these stories and how the general public consumes and understands it.
