Yet, youth tackle football has become particularly controversial because of the mixture of benefits and health risks that it offers. Using National Sports and Society Survey (N = 3993) data, this study analyzes public opinion about the appropriateness of children playing tackle football. In the process, we examine how adults’ social structural locations, traditionalist ideologies and group affiliations, and sport-related values and contexts, including football-related interactions and experiences, are associated with beliefs about the appropriateness of youth tackle football. We find that the issue is quite contested. Several prominent social structural locations (e.g., identifying as male, heterosexual) and traditionalist ideologies and group affiliations encourage support for football. Support is also elevated among those (e.g., non-White, poorer, and less educated adults) who may be most apt to view football as a means for social mobility and as relatively meritocratic. Finally, beliefs in the value of sport and immersions within football cultures and interactions seem to enhance support for children playing tackle football. Overall, our results indicate that there is substantial disagreement about the appropriateness of youth tackle football and that social forces are important in justifying and problematizing the (re)construction of it.",

If your kids an athlete, it won’t matter if they start in high school playing tackle. Trust me. There’s thousands of kids going into high school next year that never played tackle for numerous reasons (too big to play, no interest, parent won’t let them, etc) and they are going to dominate kids who played all their lives in tackle, bc they’ll out athlete them.

It's the college and NFL game that this risk is significantly increased due to size and speed generating significantly more force on impacts.\n\n3. How the game is played and coached has changed. The game is safer due to better techniques, safety measures and equipment. Coaching is less of a \"tough guy\" and a more player responsive attitude. \n\nWith this in mind, my kids will not play tackle football until middle school. Too many times parents force their kids into sports at too young of an age. This leads to significant risk of injuries especially at young age even in non-contact sports. In my humble opinion (which means nothing), your kid is significantly safer now than 5-10-20 years ago playing football.\n\nTLDR:\n\nFootball is safer due to better education, coaching and equipment than years before leading to significant reduction in head injuries. With that starting your kids to young is something to avoid.",

If accidents happen during play deal with them as they come.\n\nI thin the desire to avoid physical risks ignores the social requirements of growing up, especially as a young man but team sports are, of course, also for girls.  We can't put humans in bubble wrap and both physical adventures and team sport are important parts of growing up and learning about who we are and learning the boundaries of social interaction.\n\nThat, and if we don't give those of our kids that need a physical outlet (which I believe is a majority of them) the opportunity to express their physicality they'll make their own opportunities, which will be a lot worse both for society and for those kids personally than organized contact sport would have been.",

CA is an outlier in itself because it has such a large population.\n\nThe rules of football have changed dramatically in the last 20 years. Equipment is better. Player safety is a key focus. If you hit someone incorrectly in college ball, you're ejected from the game. The NFL hands out serious fines. \n\nIf you play sports you're going to get injured. My worst injury happened playing basketball and it was a non-contact injury (torn ACL). The best we can do is to make the sport as safe as possible through proper coaching and proper medical response post injury. Studies have indicated that people who participate in athletics do better in school and life in general, and lead overall healthier lives.

It is a mistake to put 1/2\" of foam rubber and/or rigid soled cleats between the human foot and the ground.  The artificial traction induced increases the speed, torque, and violence of the game and leads to unnecessary injuries to everything from ankles to brains.  Our feet have up to 200k nerve endings (10 times more than hands or even our sex organs - because fighting gravity is neurologically intensive).  Feet need to be in contact with the ground for proper propioception.  Propioception prevents injuries by creating body position awareness, balance, joint stability, and appropriate reactions to prevent injury.  **Barefootball** (or at least minimalist footwear) would create a more level playing field and lead to a reduction in injury from the ground up.  I have played 12 years of football through the college level and am a current youth football coach.  Culturally, it won't be easy, but barefoot soccer training is now a thing.  Contactless practices are now a thing.  Robotic tackling dummies are now a thing.  We even give kids extensive water breaks these days (who knew!).  All of this was unthinkable back in the 80s.  **Barefootball** would solve a lot of our current problems in youth football and lead to better quality of life for ex-athletes.

            "text": "The focus upon contact to the head tends to create misleading beliefs. There seems to be a misunderstanding of the mechanics of concussion. \n\nThe brain free floats in liquid inside a hard shell (the skull). The mechanics of brain injury occur when external forces cause the brain to move and strike the interior skull surface.\n\nForces such as “shaken baby syndrome”… no external head contact is generally involved; rather, picking up and then shaking a baby causes the brain to go into motion and to repeatedly strike the skull, injuring the brain (often resulting in death).\n\nLikewise, being restrained inside a moving vehicle that comes to a sudden stop will cause the brain (which is traveling the same speed as the vehicle) to strike the skull as a result of the restrained body (skull) coming to a sudden stop but the brain - floating in liquid - doesn’t stop until striking the skull.\n\nNotice that in these examples there is NO external contact with, or direct force applied to, the head. Brain injury (concussive forces) only require sudden changes of motion that result in the brain striking the interior skull.\n\nStanding 5 feet from a brick wall and the lunging forward to slam your body/shoulder into the wall is almost certainly going to cause the brain to strike the skull. Now do that a 100 times over 2 hours day after day and you are probably simulating linemen hitting a blocking sled in daily practice and slamming into each other at every snap in a game.\n\nOr the sudden stopping of momentum when bodies slam into each other during tackles. Or suddenly hitting the ground.\n\nOr being slammed into the boards in hockey. \n\nI’m not saying direct contact to the head shouldn’t be a concern because surely it should. But I am very suspicious that the billions/trillions of dollars at stake in college and professional sports that have a financial interest in focusing attention on physical blows to the head itself is the solution … when in fact it isn’t the skull we are really worried about … it is any change in momentum that results in the floating brain to strike the interior skull.\n\nWhen people with huge financial interests try to create a narrative that focuses on “blows to the head”, it creates a narrative that tries to persuade the public that the activity can be made safe by changing the activity to avoid blows to the head … as though direct blows to the head is the cause of the problem.\n\nIndeed, I believe the evidence gathered thus far demonstrates beyond any legitimate argument that, by far, the biggest risk of brain damage with permanent long term life altering affects, comes from forces other than direct blows to the head. \n\nThere is a need for the discussion and debate to be very clear in what we are trying to stop: anything that causes the floating brain to strike the inner surface of the skull. Certainly a direct blow to the head can do that if the blow is sufficient to cause the skull to change direction with the result that the floating brain continues on its current path, causing the collision with the skull.\n\nBut I perceive that force to be much less than the force of a runner at full speed having his entire body being brought to a violent stop by a defender slamming into him - and then a second motion change when his body hits the ground. There can be no doubt about the picture we have in our mind’s eye of what is happening to the floating brain during this activity.\n\nI could go on with examples of non-blows to the head causing brain trauma, but hopefully you get the picture.",

A lot of people think no player has it, a lot of people think it’s the 99% number that that one study ended with. \n\nThe fact of the matter is it is almost impossible to guess accurately, but last I heard from an actual researcher, HAS to guess a number, the answer was 10-15%. Which is still high enough to be a problem but no where near the apocalyptic number. \n\nOn top of this, people who haven’t played football or don’t know people who have, really don’t understand how much the focus on brain injuries has changed in the last 10 years even. I knew tons of people who would play through concussions 10 years ago, which would p much never happen today. That combined with other safety based rule changes thatve happened makes me pretty confident that the number of people who exclusively play non-professional football that will also get cte is pretty low. \n\nBUT from what I’ve read from coaches, it’s really not necessary to teach kids tackling that early. Playing flag would probably be totally fine till later on. Like, I think most people who actually matter and look at the issue critically would agree that starting tackle and 3 pt line stances after middle school or at 16 years old, maybe, would be a pretty uncontroversial step one. \n\nLastly I think a lot of people need to become more aware of the actual effects of CTE, and not only learn from high profile cases. It hasn’t been shown, at least in football players, to cause depression or violence or suicide. It does however, act very similarly to Alzheimer’s, with mental and decision making  impairment and confusion. Education about the Normal symptoms of cte will help destigmatize it for victims and make them more likely to seek help. \n\nIdk just my thoughts on it",

When you play a contact sport without pads you learn to protect yourself and to tackle properly. Without a battering ram on your head and a pound of plastic on your shoulders, you are forced to form tackle and wrap. You dont have a false sense of security. I think this would have many benefits to the game, it would be faster, players would have better vision (less accidental contact) and many of the ticky tac penalties would disappear. Yeah, there are still injuries in rugby, but these helmet to helmet hits we see in the NFL with guys getting carted off the feild don't happen as offen because no one wants to slam their nose into somebodies teeth...or knees",

I was a good foot taller than most kids in school - to think that I'd lose that advantage on the football field if I couldn't head the ball...\n\nContact rugby is allowed at under 8s now, with tag/touch only before that. Kids are taught early how to tackle properly and correct tackling technique is embedded early in their game knowledge. If you wait until later, then it will take a lot longer to learn and the consequences of young men tackling wrong becomes a lot more serious. \n\nIn cricket, pads and helmets are mandatory now. You'll still take a ball to the finger or inside thigh on occasion. It hurts. You learn pretty fast that it hurts and correct your batting technique. \n\nThere's always been risk involved with sport.
