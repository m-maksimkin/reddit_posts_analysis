I got an earful from the officer for not answering my phone when he called me back. I’m sorry but do people who fear for their lives typically answer their phone and start talking in volatile situations? He told me he was trying to get more information like if there were guns involved and like that’s fair but when someone can’t answer their phone wouldn’t you just take it upon the cop to make a call? It was incredible. I just wanted to leave a scary situation and from the beginning they treated me like it was my fault. I had a black eye and I was bleeding and the one cop seemed ok with that. It just struck me as odd that they are walking into a house where the woman is crying and in a mess and with facial contusions, and they sided immediately with the white guy. Who had nothing visually wrong with him.\n\nIt was the first time I called the police for help. I probably won’t ever again, because they didn’t actually help me at all in the end.

I came to a stop sign and counted to 3 Mississippis then I saw them get behind me and I knew I was getting pulled over. \n\nCop asked for all the usual which I provided. I told them I bought the car the day prior but she mentioned the paperwork said today. I told her again I bought it yesterday and I picked it up today. She asked where we were coming from and my passenger said a major city. That instantly got her suspicious. She started asking questions like what were we doing in the town we were pulled over.
