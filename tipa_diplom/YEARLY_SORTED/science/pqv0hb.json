But when the delta variant started gaining traction, there was no information about J&J's effectiveness, but some information was out on Pfizer. So I went ahead. I had no side-effects taking the Pfizer while I did with J&J.\n\nThere wasn't much information on doubling up at the time except for the University of Arizona which had some students who were in the J&J study who then decided to take one of the other vaccines later. They had a huge boost in antibodies.\n\nI'm not sure where this leaves me now as far as longevity, though.\n\nEDIT: I don't know what health insurance would do if a person got two different vaccines several months apart. My J&J shot was not sent to my insurance because Nashville had a day where they vaccinated 10,000 people at Nissan Stadium--drive through. You just had to make an appointment and no information other than name and address was taken. My Pfizer doses were sent to insurance.",

The Moderna population had  125 (26.2%) of its population from the Southern United States. The Pfizer population had 315 (42%) that came from the South? \n\nWhy would this matter? Well the study only looked at COVID-19 hospitalization, it did not follow up on any serological testing for the different groups. The period of examination was March-August 2021 and they mentioned they did not account for different variants.\n\nWe know the Delta variant is more likely to cause breakthrough infections. We know the southern US was the first region that was hit hard by the Delta variant.  We also know the Southern region in US is less likely to have mitigation strategies mandated. Particularly in the main testing time frame the South had a significant percentage of new cases and percentage of cases to total population. \n\nMy concern would be that with such a difference    I would have liked to see regional statistics on hospitalization and variant. It could be very likely given the time frame the higher Pfizer hospitalizations were in this Southern population and more likely the Delta variant.",
