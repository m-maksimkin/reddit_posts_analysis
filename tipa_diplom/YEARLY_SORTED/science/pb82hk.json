I see a lot of the issues people have to deal with. \n\nI have heard several boomers (without experience of the diagnosis) claim that “back in my day we just gave the noisy kid a smack in the back of the head and told them to sit down and shut up and it worked!” Yes it worked in the moment, but there is a reason alcohol and substance abuse was huge back then. If people don’t get help with their problems they will find the best solution they can by themselves. That often involves numbing the mind. \n\nOn the other hand, there is over diagnotisation as it stands now. Many schools have large classes and not a lot of adults, and if a kid needs extra help a diagnosis is an important key to getting allotted extra resources to hire an assistant to the teacher. Sometimes this is entirely motivated, but sometimes the school pushes for a diagnosis when the cause of the issues are more temporary and social (mom and dad getting a divorce, having siblings that require extra care and not getting enough help at home, a temporary stage in the development, etc). This has watered down a lot of people’s pictures of what the diagnosis actually means and the issues people with the diagnosis have to deal with. It’s perfectly normal for kids to be energetic and unfocused at times, that is not a disease. \n\nIt has also in some circles become popular to self diagnose. It is by some seen as something cool, and is more of a description of being energetic and “quirky”. No Jessica, you do not have ADHD because you get bored and start scrolling your phone when watching TV, and you don’t have OCD because you like keeping your kitchen drawers well organized. It’s normal. This also gives a lot of people a misleading picture of what the diagnosis means. \n\nADHD is also a spectrum. Some people have huge issues, while a lot of adults can manage the diagnosis with a bit of medication and organizing their lives in accordance to their disease. Younger people have more issues in part because they are by nature more spontaneous and energetic, and because school is rarely the best type of environment for a person with ADHD.",

This is markedly higher than the 23.6% of young adults without ADHD who have had a substance use disorder in their lifetime.  \n\nEven after considering factors such as age, race, income, education, childhood adversities and other mental illness, young adults with ADHD were still 69% more likely to have had a substance use disorder when compared to their peers without ADHD.\n\nControlling for lifetime history of mental illness and childhood adversities caused the largest attenuation of the ADHD-SUD relationship.  More than one-quarter (27%) of those with ADHD had a history of depression, which was much higher than the prevalence among those without ADHD (11%).  \n\n“These results emphasize the importance of addressing depression and anxiety when providing care to those with co-occurring ADHD and SUD,” reported lead author Esme Fuller-Thomson, Professor at University of Toronto's Factor-Inwentash Faculty of Social Work and Director of the Institute for Life Course and Aging.  “Individuals with untreated depression and anxiety may self-medicate to manage the symptoms of an untreated psychiatric disorder, which can result in greater substance use.”  \n\nThose with ADHD also experienced high levels of adverse childhood experiences, with more than a third of young adults (35%) reporting that they had been physically abused and one in nine reporting that they were a victim of sexual abuse (11%) before the age of 16.\n\nA strong association between childhood adversities and substance use disorder has been found in previous research as well.\n\n“Childhood maltreatment may disrupt emotional regulation and the neuro-development of children, which may predispose them to later developing substance dependence” says co-author Danielle Lewis, a graduate of the University of Toronto’s Masters of Social Work (MSW) Program.\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/alcalc/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/alcalc/agab048/6336025",

Apparently a large amount of ADHD people suffer from it without realizing what it is.\nBVD is a visual condition where the line of sight from one eye tends to be slightly out of alignment with the line of sight from the other eye (usually vertical) and this puts a heavy strain on the eye muscles as they are constantly trying to correct the alignment to achieve single focus leading to headaches, nausea, blurry vision, trouble focusing reading skipping lines, anxiety, and fear of open spaces, difficulty maintaining eye contact, bad hand-eye coordination or difficulty walking straight or drifting while walking and sleep difficulties.\n If you randomly learned that covering one eye helps you focus to read there's a good chance you need to ask an optometrist about BVD.\nYou can still have 20/20 vision and have BVD which is why it mostly goes undiagnosed because it's just not tested for often. This is crazy considering BVD is present in as many as 50% of children that have been diagnosed with ADHD and other learning disabilities.\n\n Edit: It can be fixed or find some symptom relief with prism glasses... I uh forgot also light sensitivity is a common symptom.\ntilting your head subconsciously which can cause neck pain.

So much stuff made sense in retrospect. Forgetting my bag in class all the time (and so many other things), thinking church was mad torture but everyone else seemed so relaxed, being desperate to avoid boring unstimulating work of any kind. Asking too many questions in class, telling myself I was going to pay attention then phasing out on tangents for like 10-15 minutes at a time. Being terrified that a job was 8+ hours of church every bloody day. My first Summer job cleaning construction sites basically confirming those fears. Thinking I loved babies and kids and I could make them love me so easily, but I couldn't stand being around them. Working from home with kids bursting into my room making me clench up ready to scream.\n\n\nSo glad I am self-aware now, medicated, and actively being aware of and taking responsibility for my behavior.

So yes my self-image and my internal monologue is a constant battle of mismanaged expectations and self-abuse.

So many things where changing in my body then anyways I had no idea if the meds actually helped.\n\nI went unmedicated for more then a decade. It was stupid. Looking back at it, I wasted nearly 1/8 of my life. And set myself back years of development. I'm now only able to keep my apartment in some what of an order.\n\nFor those who don't have, or don't know what ADHD is like I'll give you my personal example: \n\nThe basics of it is takes so much more effort to feel happy and satisfied. I'm constantly looking for the easiest way to get some kind of satisfaction. Things like binging TV, playing video games and picking up new hobbies(but not for very long) all work well.\n\nUnfortunately because I've been doing all of that for so long even with my meds it's a habit now. I need to spend so much effort just not to fall back into my old ways.\n\nIf you think you might be suffering. Talk to a doctor. Untreated ADHD has many symptoms similar to depression. Hell I would sit and watch a crappy tv show, or sleep all day,  just because it made me 2/10 happy and took 1/10 effort.

            "text": "As someone with ADD, I have found that we gravitate towards one another. I have many friends with ADHD and pretty much all of us are addicts or have addictive personalities, and suffer from anxiety and depression. The addiction does not have to be drugs ether, it could be a hobby, exercise, sex or even religion. Most things can be turned into a \"drug\" and taken to a unhealthy level. Every ADHD person I know is addicted to caffeine and if not currently at some point was addicted to nicotine. The level of dedication to their \"drug\" of choice, almost reminds me of people with autism or OCD. I personally believe autism ADHD and OCD are all on the same spectrum. I can rant forever on this subject, my personal experiences and the research I have read. \n\nBut in regards to the post I am addicted to weed. I used to abuse alcohol but I quit drinking after college because of the effect it was having on my work life. I am still an addict but a traded alcohol for weed. I started regularly smoking weed in college to alleviate my two major symptoms from Adderall, appetite suppression and sleeplessness. After my day was over I would smoke, eat/enjoy food and  sleep like a baby. The main reason I swapped alcohol addiction for marijuana was marijuana does not effect my ability to function is society, while offering some benefits to me. I do worry about the long term effects of chronic marijuana use but I know I am in a much better place now then I was as an alcoholic. I don't enjoy alcohol beverages anymore which makes things easier. pretty much all liquor makes me think of vomit, I no longer enjoy most beer or wine. The only thing I enjoy to drink is fruited sours/tart beers since they don't really taste like alcohol and because they are so acidic I can't drink more then a few with acid reflux. I was also a smoker, I still vape but I use zero nicotine fluid. Wellbutrin is what allowed me to quit smoking, while also helping my depression and some  other ADHD symptoms. If you have ADHD and are also a smoker I deeply recommend trying Wellbutrin.",

I also have major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety. I definitely think my mother had ADHD (God grant her eternal rest.). My other maternal uncle, grandmother and grandfather all were diagnosed with anxiety/depression, which myself and my uncle highly suspect was either ADHD that was misdiagnosed or was co-occurring with undiagnosed ADHD (both options reportedly being common). \n\nThose three people all had addiction problems as well as my mother before she got pregnant with me at 18. Mostly alcohol. Everyone on my mom’s side of the family was a heavy smoker for an extended period at some point, including myself. My grandpa actually died of emphysema. My sister told me she had a meth problem for a couple years when she was at college (I’m 6 years older, so we aren’t that close. Definitely not close enough that I would have known had she not told me.) I definitely have food addictions, particularly to carbs. And I was always very conscientious of my drinking before going on medication (I quite drinking once I started meds) because I could tell it would easily become an addiction for me if I drank with any sort of regularity. I typically limited it to holidays. \n\nAs others have mentioned, things in my life tend to be all or nothing. There is no moderation. I’m either in perpetual motion or motionless. I’m either eating “perfectly healthy” or like a 5 year old let loose in the pantry. I am either not smoking or back to a pack or more a day within a week, even after over a year of having quit. I’m either stone sober or blitzed out of my mind. I am either exercising every day for over an hour or not at all. It’s almost like a life of perpetual addiction, just some are healthier and more acceptable than others.\n\nI really wish it would become the standard to test for things like ADHD, autism, ocd, depression, etc. at regular intervals such as at 6yrs, 12yrs, and 18yrs in the same way children have well child visits. Developmental disorders and mental health issues can go unnoticed for so long and be so detrimental. Most people don’t have a thorough enough understanding of how these things can manifest themselves, especially in girls and less severe/stereotypical cases. If my uncle hadn’t mentioned his own late diagnosis I wouldn’t have ever gotten tested. I thought it was just depression and anxiety combined with personal failings/weaknesses. I never in a million years would have connected the dots. I have only ever known my brain, so I had no way of knowing how differently it functions than that of a neurotypical. I just thought I needed to “get my sh*t together” and “try harder.” After all, that is what others have told me, in one way or another, my whole life.",

Doing my best this year to use more exercise, but it was really hard during the pandemic as the gym had become my safe sanctuary. It wasn’t a place I went to socialize, but I enjoyed seeing the few people I did that would chat for a few seconds and back to it.

Drug/alcohol abuse are common because the insatiable curiosity leads people like us to try everything once, even if that once could lead to prolonged usage. The fact that drugs or alcohol are involved may be simply because they are in front of us and no other interesting alternatives are grabbing our attention. Speaking personally, I would likely have a problem with alcohol if it weren't for debilitating hangovers. Jumping again to curiosity; it's driven by something many people with ADD/HD possess; the ability to allow ourselves to be completed enveloped by an experience, especially a new experience. To use movies as an example, I personally love them because I get trapped in them and can feel the emotions of the characters and often leave a theatre with a sense of adventure, heartbreak or joy that can last for days. If we can talk about a positive of this \"disorder\" for a minute? Hyperfocus. Hyperfocus is a fascinating tool that, among many others, people with ADD/HD use but don't often know what it is or how to take the most advantage of it until much later in life, usually after substances have made an appearance. Hyperfocus allows us to block out our surroundings for literally hours at a time. As a kid, my brother and I (also ADHD) could sit in our room and play with Lego for more 8 hours without eating or seeing what the rest of our family was up to. We had no curiosity left for other things because it was so fixated.\n\nYes, ADD and ADHD present vulnerabilities and functional shortfalls, but they are also super powers, especially when properly understood.",

I was able to concentrate, able to focus, stop the sitcoms and inner voice in my head. Most importantly, I was able to slow down TIME. I immediately stopped using alcohol and went exclusive Cannabis only.\n\nEveryone else thought I was on some potent or tainted Cannabis but it was Government stuff. \n\nWent to get a Psychological Assessment and I came out finding out I had ADHD-c. This changed my whole perspective of life, but I had survived with so many coping mechanisms subconsciously that I breezed through life where others failed.\n\nThe Cannabis addiction can be real, as with Cannabis it really helps you focus and absorb information around you at a phenomenal rate that you've never had before WITH a dopamine push to give you a nice feeling for studying. Abstract concepts like string theory and relativity would normally blow right over my head, I was now able to visualize and come up with my own philosophies. \n\nIt's at a point where Cannabis did more good for me than bad, and I can see why ADHD'ers can get addicted because its way better than the pharmaceutical options that repress your soul and don't give you that 'feel' good feeling to continue absorbing information, you still have to put effort.

The bad news is to get any of them you basically have to become a circus animal jumping through hoop after hoop, hoping that you'll finally get a diagnosis and prescription. Psychiatry seems to have some of the worst wait times for doctors, too. We're talking like 3+ months to get a single appointment. Can you imagine if you have a serious mental illness like bipolar or schizophrenia and you need to see a doctor quickly... the support is just not there for people.\n\nThen if you manage to get an appointment with a doctor there are doctors who outright refuse to treat ADHD (they think its laziness or insist it can be treated with hand-waving therapy or time-management devices.) You'll probably have to doctor hop like a junkie before you can find an expert who even acknowledges the condition; Should you manage to succeed in getting a prescription many people describe being stigmatized at their pharmacy because their script potentially has a recreational value.\n\nMostly it's just frustrating how difficult it is to get treatment and largely depends on subjective opinions of clinicians. Diagnosis itself also isn't a straight forwards process as there are overlapping mental illnesses that have similar symptoms to ADHD (can't focus -- maybe its just chronic insomnia, maybe you have bipolar, maybe its an anxiety disorder, the list goes on.) It's quite possible to have multiple conditions -- ADHD and something else and people with ADHD often have co-morbid disorders anyway. But you can see now that diagnosis really isn't in your favor. If you manage to get a prescription you're one of the lucky ones. \n\nMaybe one day people won't have to deal with this BS just to get treatment.
