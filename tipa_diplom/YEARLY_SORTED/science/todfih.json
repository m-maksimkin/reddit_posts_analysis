            "text": "> “Far-UVC rapidly reduces the amount of active microbes in the indoor air to almost zero, making indoor air essentially as safe as outdoor air,” says David Brenner, PhD, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons and co-author of the study. “Using this technology in locations where people gather together indoors could prevent the next potential pandemic.”\n\n\nI've been reading about this Columbia group's research into Far-UVC since early in the pandemic, maybe April 2020. \n\nThis seems to be the new result, from the article.\n\n> A new study(link is external and opens in a new window) from David Brenner's lab at Columbia University's Center for Radiological Research found that far-UVC light does not cause damage in a 3-dimensional model of human skin. In another study(link is external and opens in a new window) from Brenner's team, hairless mice exposed to far-UVC light for 8 hours a day over 15 months had no signs of skin damage. The findings suggest that far-UVC light may be safe for use in occupied indoor settings.\n\nIt's a wonderful idea. It needs big money to fund a clinical trial. \n\nIt's also one of those technologies that's too expensive until there's a big enough market, I think. When I was looking during around for a Far-UVC lamp early in the pandemic, they were crazy expensive. To my surprise, looking just now I found a Far-UVC lamp available at [Wal-Mart](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Revolutionary-Safety-Far-UVC-222nm-Disinfection-Lamp-UV-instant-remove-infectious-pathogens-SGS-US-certificates-widely-used-Hospital-Clinic-School-al/930909448?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=101037946) of all places: $1,589.\n\n> During the experiment, a sprayer continuously emitted an aerosol mist of S. aureus bacteria into the room. (This microbe was chosen because it is slightly less sensitive to far-UVC light than coronaviruses, providing the researchers with an appropriately conservative model.) When the concentration of microbes in the room stabilized, the researchers turned on commercially available overhead far-UVC lamps.\n\n> The lamps inactivated more than 98% of the airborne microbes in just five minutes. The low level of viable microbes was maintained over time, even though microbes continued to be sprayed into the room.\n\nIn my imagination, restaurants have Far-UVC emitters in lamps that hang low over the table (along with conventional lighting so you can see your dinner) so the Far-UVC can kill the microbes being emitted from two people facing each other across the table. It probably wouldn't be effective, though: if you sneeze a bunch of virus at your dinner companion the light won't have time to have an effect.\n\nKeeping the restaurant as a whole relatively virus-free, e.g. 98% of the airborne microbes were inactivated by continuous use of the map, would be a good thing. If nothing else, it could become a marketing advantage:\n\n> Burger King employs Far-UVC lamps to eliminate 98% of airborne microbes so there's much less risk of infection from *anything*.",

I tried to find one of these when the pandemic started and got a LED string of emitters.  What bothers me about them and is illustrated in the picture here is that we humans (generally) can't see UV wavelengths of light.  There are super-seers that can see some amount of the UV portion of the spectrum.  However, any bulb I've seen lit up is obviously lit up.  I can see it and I'm not a super-seer.
