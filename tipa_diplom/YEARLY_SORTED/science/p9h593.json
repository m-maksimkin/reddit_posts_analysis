Drinking gave me a fuzzy, confused feeling and none of the euphoria I'd otherwise get.\n\nIt also underscored that if you are miserable, exercise is a great tool (many long distance runners have been found to be self medicating and I fell into that group when I was younger) but alcohol works to a certain degree on the other end of the spectrum.\n\nAs you get older problems become harder to fix. Jobs you hate that pay too much to leave, marriages that drain you, health problems doctors have no solution for, and other situations that may not have a good solution.\n\nIf you can work out, do it but this is not a magical cure and it's not something everyone can do.",
