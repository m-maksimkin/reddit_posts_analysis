Direct copy and paste from my comment, feel free to ask any questions or check the replies to the other comment on my profile for more info:\n\n>I work for a major community pharmacy chain. The one on the corner of something and something else, if you catch my drift.\n\n>Erectile dysfunction (ED) medications are, for some unknown to me reason, criminally overpriced in all of the major pharmacies. Like, overpriced by over a thousand dollars. When we order those drugs, it costs us about a dollar for an entire bottle of thirty, and when the bottles arrive, suddenly they're worth over a grand.\n\n>Because of the cost, almost every insurance company in America has a quantity limit of 4-6 pills a month, which brings the cost down significantly (from over a grand for a quantity of 30, to just under $200 for a quantity of four), so the insurance company doesn't have to shell out over $1,000 just so a penis-having person can have intimacy with their partner whenever they'd like. The horror, right? How dare you want to have sex with someone else more than four times a month?\n\n>Anyway.....\n\n>There's a few other pharmacies, usually the ones in grocery stores (though this depends on the area you're in), **and one pharmacy in particular that exists inside of a store that is known for having an exclusive membership, treating its employees very well, paying higher wages, and giving out free samples of food to shoppers....** *(cough Cos\\*\\*\\* cough)*....\n\n>... where the charge for a full bottle of thirty is less than thirty dollars if you use a discount card. That latter pharmacy, what with the free samples and such, actually charges less than 50 bucks, even without a discount, and you don't need a membership to the store to use their pharmacy.\n\n>I've talked with dozens of customers whose copays in my store were insultingly high about this before, and each time I tell them \"I'm not telling you this because I want you to go away or get your medicine somewhere cheaper. I'm not saying you should do anything, I just thought you'd think it's interesting that at (store at this location, open from this time to this time), they charge (amount) for THIRTY of these, instead of (current copay) for (current quantity). Isn't that interesting? If you were so inclined, you could even tell me to put these away and then go there right now, and I obviously wouldn't stop you. Just a thought.\"\n\n>I've been turned down maybe three times, and usually only because they either don't mind the copay and/or they didn't quite understand what I was telling them.",

            "text": "Something to live for, buddy!  \nI wonder sometimes about studies done in northern Europe, (Switzerland, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein , Norway etc.) because the backdrop against which much of their studies are cast, is a very different lifestyle than most of the rest of the world.   \nFor instance. I saw this study saying people who had three or more dry sauna sessions per week, experienced a 40% reduction in all-cause mortality. It was f rom Finland. Digging a little deeper, I saw what I that might be statistical noise in for form of other factors, like the amazingly-low heart disease rate in some of northern Europe,  generally less gun violence, and street violence in general, a populace who embraces science and vaccines, and a far cleaner food profile than say, people here in the US or even the UK, and I wonder if any of these played into the results of the study.  \nWhat do you think? I've always wondered at the accuracy of sample segments in studies like this.  \nHere's the article.[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sauna/regular-sauna-users-may-have-fewer-chronic-diseases-idUSKBN1KM5U0](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-sauna/regular-sauna-users-may-have-fewer-chronic-diseases-idUSKBN1KM5U0)\n\n(I realize I am showing my lack of scientific acumen here, but at least I can learn)\n\nThanks!  \nMB",
