A study published today in mBio reveals that mutations in the gut microbiome have allowed certain bees to not just eat meat, but eat dead animals that are teeming with potentially harmful bacteria. “The vulture bee microbiome is enriched in acid-loving bacteria, which are novel bacteria that their relatives don’t have,” coauthor Quinn McFrederick, an entomologist at the University of California, Riverside said in a press release. “These bacteria are similar to ones found in actual vultures, as well as hyenas and other carrion-feeders, presumably to help protect them from pathogens that show up on carrion.” While their vegetarian cousins have pouches on their legs for storing pollen, these “vulture bees” were seen storing chicken used in bait traps. And, while they don’t have stingers to defend themselves, they are able to bite potential predators using an extra tooth they’ve evolved along the way to tear bits of meat from the source.",

This comment has since been deleted, but I wanted to add my thoughts here nonetheless:\n\nI think there are several issues as to why they haven't managed to do this, at least by how I see it:\n\n - large prey can run pretty fast (usually) and quite far away. Poison injected by a few bees will most likely take a little while to incapacitate or even slow down a large animal, which makes it very impractical for insects to follow them.\n - scavengers and other prey animals still exist in the ecosystem, the bees would have fierce competition for that almost dying / dead animal\n - generally animals have a rough exterior. It takes quite a lot of effort to get to the edible part through fur, skin, etc. time in which other predators / scavengers will have no issue to rip them apart and eat them.\n - generally wild animals have good defenses against stings, their skin being thicker than that of humans and being protected by fur. This means the bees would have to develop some exceptionally deadly and fast acting poison, given that the animal will only be bitten once or twice before running away.\n - insects in general rely on pheromones, dances or other strange methods of communication, which are not as instant as sight and sound are for pack predators. This means coordination to swarm a particular target is far slower and more difficult than when they are on defense against an animal which is attacking their hive and has an incentive to stick around the hive (honey).",
