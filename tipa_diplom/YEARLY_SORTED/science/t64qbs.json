Tinnitus is a GREAT going to sleep sound and is a wonderful sign on the roadmap to lucid dreaming or sleep.

            "text": "Here's my take on this. I'm an active researcher with a PhD in molecular biochemistry and a chronic tinnitus sufferer, so I think I offer a pretty balanced, critical view on this type of research.\n\nThe overall take is good, this appears to have a much greater effect than any intervention published previously, with almost 90% significant improvement among those who completed atleast 5 treatments.\n\nHowever, there is some issues with the data, many of which the authors recognise themselves in the discussion so I won't repeat that. My main gripe is the scale used has broad intervals, meaning 8 vs 6 is a marginal difference in perceptional but ensures the change will be statistically significant. Anyone with chronic tinnitus knows, how you would rate it day to day changes dependent on an array of factors so a superficial scale like this is not accurate enough for this purpose, imo. \n\nLikewise, the way the data is displayed in the final graph is very striking, but also strange. Despite reporting distinct SD values in the table, all the error bars on the graph are the same size. The sample size being only 50 odd, this doesn't make sense. Not to mention no controls, etc. It would of been far more telling to display all the individual data points in a scatter. \n\nI notice, although they report the parameters for how they selected patients as appearing a good unbiased approach, they also say ALL of the patients had previous nerve blocking procedures. I wonder how that effected results and what other treatments these people had already received. \n\nI tried to find info about where this was done, it's in South Korea ofcourse but it does not say where the procedures were performed. It appears to be the lead author who has performed the treatments, who is linked to a private pain clinic in their own name. I can't find any info about this clinic other than an address, which appears to be a one man back street chriopractor kind of affair. 3 of the 4 authors have the same (surname?). I'm not familiar with how s Korean names are organised but does this mean they are related, which could suggest a bias as the senior author is registered at a different institute through which this was published.\n\nLastly, this is published in frontiers neuroscience. Now, some frontiers journals are better than others, but as someone in the trade, I can tell you frontiers is the go to place when you've got weak data / want to avoid rigorous review. I have several papers in frontiers journals with higher impact than their neroscience journal and can tell you it is incredibly easy to get published. On this paper, there is only 2 reviewers, both in the UK. Given the treatments were performed between 2017-2018, and only just now got published, and it's a very small data set which wouldn't have taken very long to process, I can all but guarantee this has been doing the rounds at better journals and getting rejected, eventually ending up in frontiers. A paper like this does not take 3-4 years to submit and publish. \n\nIn summary, I'm excited by the results and it absolutely warrants a properly conducted clinical trial, and I hope the authors are trying to make that happen. However as it stands, I won't be flying to S Korea to get needles stuck in my head, just yet.",

I took that as me having \"better\" hearing than them because they always said I could hear things and identify them even when there's noise all around. \n\nI only learned about tinnitus when the internet finally became more widespread and I was able to research if other people heard the same thing that's in my head. I found out I wasn't alone and it's actually not normal. I guess that means I've never truly known what total silence is like. \n\nThankfully the tinnitus doesn't really get in my way. Most of the time I don't even know it's there. I only \"hear\" it when there's nothing else making noise, like at night when trying to sleep. It also hasn't really affected my music skills/piano playing. I can still play and figure out songs on my own after hearing them and I don't even need sheet music at all. Whenever I play piano, I don't \"hear\" the tinnitus sound.\n\nStill, it would be nice to get rid of this tinnitus. As far as I know, there are different \"frequencies\" or \"sounds\" of tinnitus.

And this is where I believe there may be a problem.\n\nAgain, as someone who has had tinnitus for the past 20 years I believe that the negative impact of tinnitus on one's life is generally much greater at the early stages of \"getting\" (or developing) tinnitus. When you hear your tinnitus for the first time, then start realizing it's not going away, it becomes the main focus of your attention and soon of your entire life, you don't know what's happening or how to get rid of this ringing that is stuck in your head, you may even never have heard of tinnitus. You cannot sleep properly, cannot focus, cannot work and stop interacting with friends and family and start losing interest in even the things you love. Its negative impact is at its peak at this point.\n\nHowever, chances are that after some time (with or without some form of treatment or therapy) you will learn to live with it and its impact will likely be less severe on your quality of life. Personally, a few years ago I would have given a rating of 8-10 on this score, but now it's closer to 1-2, without any treatment or therapy, which is exactly the trend of the optimistic curve in this trial.\n\nTherefore I suspect that these results might be skewed due to the passing of time being excluded as a factor in this treatment. Although I am neither a doctor, researcher or statistician, I'd be inclined to claim that the results would look somewhat different if they had separated the patients by those who were new to tinnitus and those who have had it already for years.\n\nI don't want to be a party pooper and I applaud anyone who proactively researches and tries to help push the boundaries of tinnitus treatment, but I am cautious and this one is a big question I'd love to get answers to before I could feel optimistic.\n\nProtect your ears folks, silence is golden.",

He told me it was tinnitus. He then told me how he got tinnitus during Vietnam. He was on a battleship and was near the big guns on the boat that were pummeling an enemy position.
