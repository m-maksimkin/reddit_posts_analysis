Historical, field, and experimental data consisting of more than 225,000 purchase decisions indicated that introducing a $0.01-per-ounce sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) tax—without making it salient on price tags—had no significant effect on purchasing (−1.26%, p = .28). However, when the phrase “includes sugary drink tax” was added to tax-inclusive price tags, SSB purchasing was lower than (a) in the pretax period (−9.78%, p < .001), (b) in a posttax period when drinks did not bear price tags (−5.04%, p < .001), and (c) in a posttax period when drinks bore tax-inclusive price tags that did not mention the tax (−3.83%, p = .002). Making the tax’s beneficiary (student programs) salient on price tags had no added effect. Two follow-up studies suggested that tax salience was effective partly because consumers overestimated the tax amount, leading to reduced purchase intentions.",

A can of coke (33cl or 11oz) used to have almost 300 calories and now is only 130. Ice tea is only 70 calories per can. This was great for people who want to drink something other than Coke Zero.\n\nEdit: Disclaimer after some comments below. 300 calories is an exageration on my part. I do not know the exact content before the tax was implemented. I can't find the source but take it with a grain of salt.

In addition, thanks to developments in non-sugar, calorie-free beverages and the support they enjoyed, 29% of sales during 2019 were non-sugar beverages in the company's total beverage offering.\n\n \n\nAs an example of the work carried out during these years, it should be noted that, as part of the reformulation processes to reduce the addition of sugar, since 2014, Fanta Oranje and Fanta Pineapple have reduced their added sugar content by 65.4% and 91 .2%, respectively. Thus, currently, all Fanta brand flavors are without or low-calorie because they have an amount of added sugars equal to or less than 4.5 g/100 ml and 20 kcal/100 ml, derived from the total amount of sugars.\n\n \n\nAnother of the company's main brands, Aquarius, has also reduced its percentage of total sugars in the last five years in its Aquarius variety (from 6.3 g/100 ml in 2014 to 4.4 g/100 ml in 2019, which represents a 30.2% reduction in the total sugar content) and Aquarius Orange (from 7.9 g/100 ml in 2014 to 4.5 g/100 ml in 2019, which represents a 43% reduction in the total sugar content). sugars).",

But Americans also respond better to marketing than to incentives. i.e., Americans can be manipulated for good or for evil.

It tasted better than the McDonald's burger, it was almost exactly the same price, and A&W marketed the hell out of it. So why did it fail to sell? **Because, according to surveys, people thought that 1/3 of a pound was *less meat* than 1/4 of a pound.** A&W eventually gave up trying to educate the American fast food consumer about fractions, renamed their burger the \"Papa Burger\"...and it's their signature burger to this day.\n\nThe lesson: don't expect consumers to understand math.
