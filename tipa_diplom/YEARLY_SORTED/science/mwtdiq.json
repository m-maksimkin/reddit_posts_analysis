Many organic components like taurine the body can manufacture, but a person might benefit from supplementation from pills or selecting specific foods that naturally contain it.  Those aren't essential.  Vitamin C *cannot* be synthesized, you MUST consume it from food or you will get sick and possibly die of scurvy. So it's an \"essential nutrient\".\n\n\"Essential oils\" is a totally different root.  It comes from \"essence\", that is, a SMELL.  It doesn't mean \"required/necessary\".  Only that it has, and IS, a smell.  Which means it must be a volatile organic compound.  Also, the term does require the substance be liquid at room temp, so smelly solids that make volatiles aren't \"essential oils\".  Many of these liquid VOCs are not safe to consume or even put on the skin.  \n\nMOST of the interpretation of what essential oils do is that their actions work specifically via smelling it, rather than consuming it.  But, that interpretation may vary.  If you ingest an \"essential oil\" without smelling it, then that does sort of go against the basic concept.\n\nTea tree oil has demonstrable antifungal properties on topical use.  Its smell is not the mechanism, smelling it is unnecessary.  While it can be smelled and thus is an \"essential oil\", its use isn't as per the concept of essential oil.",

In other words, it works better than chlorhexidine in the oral cavity without the side effects as long as it is applied and used properly. Other oils like clove and oregano follow suit in some order.\n\nI have no idea why people insist on propaganda like this. It's so obvious. The title is so misleading.

Essential oils are neither \"naturally occuring\" (in the concentrations they are available) nor inherently useful, they must be considered on a case by case basis and scrutinized intensely before used as medicines. Camphor, thujone, etc have been brought up in other comments are being capable of eliciting neurological issues, they aren't alone in their harmful effects. \n\nOther examples abound, there's quite a bit of overlap in the presence of some compounds. Most of us are smart enough to recognize that eating enormous amounts of everyday herbs and spices would be a bad idea, essential oils permit the intake of basically the same substances present in very large quantities of plant material with relative ease - often bypassing first-pass metabolism in the liver. \n\nPlant derived compounds can be extremely powerful (and unpleasant) drugs that can interfere with the ability of a person to function, e.g., safely operate a vehicle. Myristicin, derived from nutmeg and other common spices, is a more potent hallucinogen than mescaline (cactus), but is seldom taken in sufficient quantities to elicit mental changes, except by desparate & bored people in prison (please don't do this, you will regret it immensely). \n\nInconsistencies between plants used in the production of oil products can be determined and largely accounted for by preparing a mix from a large sample, as is typically done with wines produced by large operations (e.g., with red blends, mixed for consistent flavor). \n\nUnfortunately, sufficient regulatory scrutiny isn't currently present. Some of the large essential oil companies are using unsavory distribution methods, lying or exaggerating the effects of their products, and at times acting in line with what I would expect from a cult (I would love to hear if anyone else has seen this with older friends and relatives).",
