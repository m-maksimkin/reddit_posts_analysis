Agricultural emissions are only 9% of our footprint with meat making up a fraction of this. Even if it was half, which is a massive overestimation, arguing that 4% or so of our emissions footprint for something we NEED to subsist is the problem we should be made to feel personally guilty and responsbile about is absrud. \n\nThey have super polluting cargo ships and massive factories dumping CO2 into the atmosphere, and about 100 companies are responsible for the overwhelming amount of greenhouse gasses, but this is somehow on me eating my burger? \n\nI really want to see the narrative change on this. \n\n(Just to be clear, meat consumption CAN be problematic depending on the area. For example, in Brazil they are chopping down rainforests to graze cattle. In other regions their process pollutes rivers. And in others, they utilize too much water.\n\nThe thing is, though, while all of those environmental problems are valid, they don't really factor into \"our\" meat consumption, do they? I am not eating Brazilian beef.)",
