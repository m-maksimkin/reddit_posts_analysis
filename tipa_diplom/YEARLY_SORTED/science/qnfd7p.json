However, I think governments are using fear of COVID as a justification to ignore human rights.\n\nYour fear should not give you the right to effectively ban someone from getting an education, working, or shopping. You should not be allowed to ban someone from participating in society. Especially when vaccinated people can still contract and spread the disease you are afraid of.\n\nAnd for those saying that these aren't \"real mandates\" because you still have the option to get tested weekly, that isn't a real option. First, those tests in my area cost ~$100 each. Most workplaces and schools are requiring testing between 2-5 times a week. That's $200-500 a week. Second, the option for testing appears to be preliminary. My workplace and school are removing the option for testing instead of vaccination starting in January. Third, we know that vaccinated people can catch and transmit the illness. It may even be harder for a vaccinated person to tell that they are ill, which would mean they are less likely to stay home when they are actively shedding the virus. Why aren't we forcing these tests on vaccinated people as well knowing this? It's simple, the tests are just a way to force non-vaccinated people to give in without using a hard mandate, though it appears a hard mandate is coming regardless.\n\nI'm a healthcare provider. One of the most important ethical values I believe in is the right to bodily autonomy; the right to refuse treatment. I know the history of forced medical procedures and what that meant. I will not allow fear to break my belief in an individual's right to choose.\n\nI would rather die with the consequences of freedom than live with the tyranny of fear.",

Based on available science and the fact of the endemic nature of this virus I feel that a vaccine is not necessary or useful to me at this juncture. Natural immunity is longer lasting and more effective. My risk of RE infection is extremely low, my immune system is generally strong and my vitamin d levels are high. Therepudics are coming to market rapidly. When I weigh the risks for me the low chance of vaccine side effects is more of an unknown quantity then the risk for virus with serious complications. Many other countries allow prior infection with the development of antibodies to be equal to vax status, based on the available science.  If things on the ground change drastically I may reconsider but the history of Corona viruses is that the wane and become endemic, and this is happening already.  So count me in the “not getting the vaccine” category.   I don’t get the flu shot either. I have gotten a bad flu once in the last 15 years (aside from Covid). Everyone’s risk tolerance and requirement is different. When will we stop the madness of the false dichotomy. Vax or unVax. It’s not following the science or logic.",

I realize that 18% seems like a small number, but it's really not when you realize we are talking about 18% of half of 47% of the US population.\n\nFirst: half of everyone on the planet has received at least one dose of a vaccine (for Pfizer, Aztera Zeneca, or Moderna its half of what they need; the others it is all the need) not counting ongoing boosters in some countries. You would think if something truly massive was wrong regarding the vaccine, it would have occurred by now.\n\nSecond: as for long term effects, a) the vaccine is only in your body for 24-48 hours before it goes out in urine so what long term effects, and b) we know the short and medium term effects of Covid and they are horrible, so I can't imagine that the long term effects will be good; the long term effects of the vaccines, if there were any, they would quite the uphill battle for them to be considered worse than the known Covid ones.\n\nThird: if there were something known to be bad about the vaccine that is being hidden, why are the rich getting it first? You know if there was anything the governments thought was bad or untested, they would have dropped him on their lowest class or another country first. That it was sent out immediately to first responders and the rich were able to jump the line gave me better information than any scientist or article ever could.\n\nAll of the vaccine avoidance feels like one giant \"you can't make me\" childish tantrum and people looking for a somewhat justified reason to be an asshole rolled into one. There are a lot of people in this country (USA, but I feel that statement can be correct for almost anywhere in the world nowadays) who can't see more than a week in front of them and even shorter if it doesn't concern them. Them getting the vaccine could help/save themselves but God forbid that it also help/save someone else; especially if that someone is someone they don't know or that they view as lesser than them. For those people not against it but on the fence because they are wanting for more science, the science is in and it looks good. This has pretty much been one of the largest case studies of any vaccine efficacy ever.\n\nI got the shots (Moderna). The first one was like getting a flu shot. The second one knocked me on my ass for a day with fever, joint aches, and chills but subsided very suddenly when my body figured out that it wasn't directly under attack yet. The booster (because I fall into the high risk category) was like the second but with a shorter time-frame. Overall, still better than any of symptoms of Covid and a hell of a lot shorter of a time.\n\nIf you are on the fence about getting it for yourself or a loved one, what does your doctor say when you ask them? Unless you have a medical reason not to get it or you go to a quack who got their \"medical\" degree online at night school, I think we all know the answer. So put down you phone, sit down, roll up your sleeve, and stop being a jackass for once in your damn life. Consider it a risk worth taking; like a lottery ticket because you have a better shot winning that than having most of the complications from the shot(s).\n\nPre-emltive edit: I realize that I might be exaggerating a bit on some pieces a tad, however I also know that the people this call should be going out to aren't going to care about the truth anyway. You want to know the accurate numbers, look at the FDA, CDC, and WHO.",

This presented with an unusual pattern and my doctors ridiculed me as mental and finally insisted I see a psychiatrist before they would continue treating me! Some time later doctors decided I had Guillan Barre from which I am mostly recovered at this time.\n\nI have had three vaccines since then, one tetanus and two flu, and partially lost the use of an arm for around six  weeks each time. One thing I know, the medical community doesn't give a \\*\\*\\*\\*, and has no compassion when unusual symptoms appear.\n\nI have also had myocarditis several times following viral infections. Some research points to a genetic predisposition for this condition.\n\nMy doctors say I had COVID in late December 2019. Eight out of nine people in my household at that time became moderately ill and completely lost sense of taste and smell for a few days.\n\nI have severe, chronic, genetic migraine and that got a lot worse during and after COVID. MRI shows new scar tissue in my brain, the neurologist thinks from COVID.\n\nWill the COVID vaccine send me into status migrainus? Nobody knows. If that happens it might not be treatable. The kind of migraine I have is so severe that I scream till I pass out and repeat that for 24 to 72 hours.\n\nI now live alone and have no objection to wearing masks in public.

According to a new survey, half of U.S. adults who are still unwilling to get the coronavirus vaccine say there is nothing anyone can do to change their minds.\n\nIn a nationwide poll of more than 6,000 American adults, an international team of researchers found that the main reason revolves around fears that the COVID-19 vaccine is unsafe. Study authors conducted the poll in April 2021, with a third of respondents coming from across the U.S. and the rest living in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Dallas, and Chicago.\n\nOf the 2,000 participants coming from areas around the U.S., one in five (21.4%) are unwilling to take the COVID vaccine. The only major city in the survey with a similar number of residents avoiding the vaccine was Dallas (19.7%). Just 10.1 percent of New Yorkers are still unwilling to get vaccinated, followed by 11.2 percent in Chicago, and 11.5 percent in Los Angeles.\n\nFor those refusing to take the vaccine, half say nothing can convince them to reconsider. Previous studies have found that unvaccinated individuals are at the greatest risk of dying from a coronavirus infection — regardless of age or pre-existing conditions.\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00794-6",

There’s plenty of movies about it and I’m old enough to remember the scares of SARS, MERS, Avian Bird Flu, H1N1. I’m not a scientist but more than one of those are Corona viruses.
