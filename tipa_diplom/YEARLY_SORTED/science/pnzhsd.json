The study would have needed to identify couples consisting of two people who were fully vaccinated, trying to get pregnant (as in, not using birth control during a pandemic), successfully getting pregnant, carrying a child to full term, and then evaluating the child after birth for developmental side effects. Assuming such a couple was enrolled in a study and took the very first available doses of the vaccine, their child is still well under a year old.   I am assuming that you could use existing data in lieu of a true control group. \n\nThere’s a reason that it’s so difficult to get approval for a drug or treatment to be used during pregnancy in non-pandemic times.

It is triggered by the immune system’s response to Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) and is different from other clotting conditions. \n\nTo date, there have been 125 cases of TTS assessed as related to the Vaxzevria (AstraZeneca) vaccine from approximately 9.6 million vaccine doses. These cases most often occurred about 2 weeks after vaccination. So far in Australia, all of the TTS cases have occurred after a first dose of the vaccine. Women in younger age groups seem to be slightly more likely to develop clots in unusual locations, such as the brain or abdomen, which have more serious outcomes. Eight people have died as a result of TTS – 6 of these were women. In Australia, the risk of dying from TTS after vaccination is less than 1 in a million (people receiving a first dose).  ",
