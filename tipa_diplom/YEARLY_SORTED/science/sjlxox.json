It seems it doesn’t matter the source of the information or how severe the warning, the response is always “it’s just a plant”.\n\nAnyway, as many users have already mentioned…moderation is key! \n\n\nhttps://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-medication/cannabis/health-effects/effects.html#a2",

See [https://www.karger.com/article/fulltext/494992](https://www.karger.com/article/fulltext/494992) for details.",

If someone really just had “stronger” lungs all their lung values (aside from their residual values) would increase proportionately. \n\n2) what is being ignored is the reduction in carbon monoxide transfer, or DLCO, which indicates a defect in the ability of gasses including oxygen to move between the alveoli of the lung and the blood in the alveolar capillaries. This occurs despite an INCREASED alveolar volume, makes the deficiency all the more marked. You could argue that these findings support a theory that Cannabis smoke causes interstitial lung disease out of proportion to obstructive lung disease, but I wouldn’t go that far. I would just say it’s clear there is real damage shown by smoking weed in this cohort, but that the damage occurs in a different pattern than classic tobacco smoke exposure. \n\nsource: I am a pulmonary research scientist",

However, long-term follow-up data are scarce, and mostly based on young adults. Objective. To assess the effects of cannabis and tobacco on lung function in mid-adult life. Methods. Cannabis and tobacco use were reported at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, 38, and 45 years in a population-based cohort study of 1037 participants. Spirometry, plethysmography, and carbon monoxide transfer factor were measured at age 45. Associations between lung function and cannabis use were adjusted for tobacco use. Measurements and Main Results. Data were available from 881 (88%) of 997 surviving participants. Cumulative cannabis use was associated with lower Forced Expiratory Volume in one second to Forced Vital Capacity ratios, due to a tendency towards higher Forced Vital Capacities. Cannabis use was also associated with higher total lung capacity, functional residual capacity, residual volume, and alveolar volume along with lower mid-expiratory flows, airway conductance, and transfer factor. Quitting regular cannabis use between assessments was not associated with changes in spirometry. Conclusions. Cannabis use is associated with higher lung volumes suggesting hyperinflation. There is evidence of increased large-airways resistance and lower mid-expiratory airflow, but impairment of Forced Expiratory Volume in one second to Forced Vital Capacity ratio is due to higher Vital Capacities. This pattern of effects is different to those of tobacco. We provide the first evidence that lifetime cannabis use may be associated with impairment of gas transfer.",

For example, persons who used tobacco & marijuana daily would perhaps have different spirometry than those who used either tobacco or marijuna vs those who used neither.\n\nFrom earlier in the abstract: \"Cannabis and tobacco use were reported at ages 18, 21, 26, 32, 38, and 45 years in a population-based cohort study of 1037 participants. Spirometry, plethysmography, and carbon monoxide transfer factor were measured at age 45.\"\"\n\nThis in particular causes some concern for me: \"We provide the first evidence that lifetime cannabis use may be associated with impairment of gas transfer.\"\n\nSo they had people self-report at the specified ages and did spirometry testing at 45 years of age. I want to have trust in the publishing scientific community. But unless I can find some details about how exactly they adjusted lung functions for cannabis use vs tobacco use, i just can't trust their conclusions at all.\n\nIt's entirely possible they numbers don't hold up to scientific review, and they jumped to conclusions in eagerness to publish. It's also entirely possible that the numbers do hold up, and I'm just being a hater.

Many pot smokers, especially reflecting on their younger years, would likely be able to attest to times where filling your lungs to the absolute brim with smoke was almost - normalized. For example, taking a deep bong rip (possibly with ice to make the rip less “harsh”).\n\nI think it’s good that these days there are dry vape options. For example, there are devices (see: PAX) that allow you to heat your cannabis up to the point of releasing the vapors. Is it still damaging? I would assume so based off principal. However, I would controlling the temperature of substance and limiting the amount of smoke inhaled be a far safer alternative, one where potential benefits of cannabis may far outweigh the “costs” of inhaling smoke? I’m sure this possibility would need to be considered as well if all parties are being honest.\n\nI favor legalization, and acknowledge the significant of articles like this. We should note however that, similar to when alcohol was researched in the US government in the mid-20th century, there was once no T.I.P.S.-like recommendation for drinking “responsibly” (see: Morris Chavetz).\n\nI believe once cannabis is easier to research, and once a plethora more research is allowed and accepted at the level of federal government, there will also be guidelines for ways of consuming cannabis “responsibly” - the above may lead to a warning similar to the surgeon general’s warning on tobacco products.",

Probably now more than ever due to the increased prevalence and frequency of cannabis use amongst younger people is the effects of cannabis on peoples physical development, and brain development. Eg how does the daily affect the physical development of someone who starts smoking it frequently and daily at the age of 15. \n\nWhile it might not be the drug itself, but possibly the lifestyle eg missing out on physical activities not eating 3 times a day etc, I think a lot of people who become stoners at the key stage of their final physical growth end up not fulfilling their genetic potential. \n\nAlso probably more to the drug, especially with a lot of cannabis being very strong these days, the effects on the growing brain cannot be ignored and again we will start to see a lot of wasted potential. \n\nNot anti cannabis.

That's anti-argument to legalize a drug. There are more cases, because alcohol is legal and people can do it on public. Well... not literally, but I mean they don't have to hide. If drug is legalized, more people do it, because of access and more social acceptance. Or at least legal acceptance. And it would lead to more death cases as well. I'm not super against cannabis.

But about this posting.\n\nIt seems this research was published in the [Addiction, Volume 116 issue 1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.15075) in 2020 but only recently it was published in the [American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine](https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/10.1164/rccm.202109-2058OC) this year after being submitted in 2021.\n\nEven more strangely, the journal has two authors for the 2020 article. One of which is Robert Hancox who is a cited author on the 2022 paper that also includes author credits for professors at Duke University. The other author from the 2020 paper, Kathryn Gracie, is not mentioned on the most recent paper published in the American journal.\n\nSeems EurekAlert! is feeding old news that’s been revamped with American scholars. Any PHDs or doctors who can comment on why and how this old research is republished again in a different journal with different authors?\n\nTo be clear, the research is sound and the evidence does suggest smoking marijuana has negative consequences for the lungs. Then again, isn’t anything that goes into the lungs that isn’t oxygen likely to harm them?",

What were their results?\n\n>\t**Results** Marijuana exposure was nearly as common as tobacco exposure but was mostly light (median, 2-3 episodes per month). Tobacco exposure, both current and lifetime, was linearly associated with lower FEV1 and FVC. In contrast, the association between marijuana exposure and pulmonary function was nonlinear (P < .001): at low levels of exposure, FEV1 increased by 13 mL/joint-year (95% CI, 6.4 to 20; P < .001) and FVC by 20 mL/joint-year (95% CI, 12 to 27; P < .001), but at higher levels of exposure, these associations leveled or even reversed. The slope for FEV1 was −2.2 mL/joint-year (95% CI, −4.6 to 0.3; P = .08) at more than 10 joint-years and −3.2 mL per marijuana smoking episode/mo (95% CI, −5.8 to −0.6; P = .02) at more than 20 episodes/mo. With very heavy marijuana use, the net association with FEV1 was not significantly different from baseline, and the net association with FVC remained significantly greater than baseline (eg, at 20 joint-years, 76 mL [95% CI, 34 to 117]; P < .001).\n\n>\t**Conclusion** Occasional and low cumulative marijuana use was not associated with adverse effects on pulmonary function.\n\nInteresting, even “With very heavy marijuana use, the net association with FEV1 was not significantly different from baseline”.",
