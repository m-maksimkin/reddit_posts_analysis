Efforts so far have proven successful in forms that do not allow full realization of these properties, such as polymerization at flat interfaces or fixation of monomers in immobilized lattices. Another frequently employed synthetic approach is to introduce microscopic reversibility, at the cost of bond stability, to achieve 2D crystals after extensive error correction. Here we demonstrate a homogenous 2D irreversible polycondensation that results in a covalently bonded 2D polymeric material that is chemically stable and highly processable. Further processing yields highly oriented, free-standing films that have a 2D elastic modulus and yield strength of 12.7 ± 3.8 gigapascals and 488 ± 57 megapascals, respectively. This synthetic route provides opportunities for 2D materials in applications ranging from composite structures to barrier coating materials.\n\n[Original source](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04296-3)",

If it’s spontaneous at STP then this is revolutionary)\n\nAll things considered, this “2DPA-1” material could be a game-changer for protective gear and coatings, construction (specifically corrosion protection, which is BIG if true), fuel transport (methane and hydrogen need this to be commercially viable), and likely much more.\n\nHuge props to Prof. Michael Strano, Yuwen Zeng (lead author, PhD), and their team. They’re already looking into further modifications to these sheets.

For context, steel and raw carbon fiber both have an elastic modulus of about 200GPa, which is literally an order of magnitude higher. (On another note, what's annoying is that the news article described this material with an elastic modulus \"between four and six times greater than that of bulletproof glass\", which is sensationalist garbage. Bulletproof glass is traditionally just glass laminated with polycarbonate. And polycarbonate's modulus isn't exactly high - which is precisely the reason it even works as the \"soft\" glass in a bulletproof laminate.)\n\nSteel *can* have a yield strength of around 500MPa, similar to this polymer, but depending on alloy and heat treatment it can also go as high as 2GPa (4 times higher). Carbon fiber is on a whole different level, with tensile strengths up to 6-7GPa in raw form and reduced down to 2-3GPa in composite form.\n\nSo I wouldn't exactly expect this material to replace steel in skyscraper structures, or carbon fiber in plane wings, anytime soon.\n\nI'll be honest - I'm having trouble trying to figure out exactly what it is they claim to be the true advantage of this material over, say, carbon fiber. It would be a pretty important thing if such a material was easily processed and fabricated using techniques applied to other polymers, such as injection molding or 3D printing. The article seems to make no claims for that.\n\nThey do claim two things: that it can be used to make barriers that are impermeable to gas, and that it can be used in composites. But you can make gas-impermeable barriers with other, established materials, and this one wouldn't have any advantages unless you also needed that barrier to be extremely strong and lightweight as well for whatever reason. So that would probably limit its applications to extremely niche scientific uses.\n\nAs for composites, I fail to see any reason this would make for better composite properties than carbon fiber, which we've been using for decades.\n\nI dunno. I don't mean to sound overly critical of this, since I would normally be excited for new, stronger materials that can be built into lighter things. But time will tell if this will amount to anything more than graphene (like they say, graphene can do just about anything except leave the lab.)",
