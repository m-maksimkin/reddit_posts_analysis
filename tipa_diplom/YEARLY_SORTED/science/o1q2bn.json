When you add so many variables to a model, that makes it inherently more difficult to obtain a low p-value. It's not surprising, then, that the author found a null result when adding so many statistical controls. Null findings are important when the rest of a study has been tightly controlled. In this case though, the author wants you to interpret NULL FINDINGS–which literally are findings that are not statistically interpretable–because his failure to collect a sample with two demographically similar groups backed him into a corner with his analyses.\n\nTwo other issues: 1) I can't find anything describing the age of the sample. This is obviously important for the reader to be aware of given the topic of the articles, so that's both disappointing and concerning. 2) The sample was of Michigan adults. It's important to consider that the state of Michigan has a relatively low average socioeconomic status, which could also have affected results. However, these two other issues are hardly worth mentioning given that this is a report of null findings on a loosely controlled study design, making them categorically uninterpretable.",

I've dated a few women with kids thinking I could handle it but truth is I'm a light sleeper(as in any literal sound the child makes in the next room I shoot up and some nights I dont sleep when kids spend the night), I get anxious and I also get annoyed that I cant just do stuff I want to do. Now I love my kid to bits and he is almost graduating, but the thought of having another kid or dating a woman with kids always starts off as maybe things will improve with me, but end up with me being extremely exhausted and depressed. I have finally given up on the idea and stopped dating women with kids despite how many of them that have or want to have but I feel happier even if I am single. Eventually I'll find someone that doesnt want to have kids and just enjoy our hobbies and time together, hopefully excepting that despite me not wanting to have more kids they can handle the one I do have since he is grown up and nearly out of the house.

My wife was quite keen on them though and I didn't not want them enough to not have them, so I agreed that we should start trying.\n\nTried for a number of years and finally got pregnant during lockdown.  My daughter was born just under 3 weeks ago and I'm surprised at how much positive impact it has had on my life so far - I know its very early days but the things I thought I would hate I do not mind doing as I really love her very much.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is that its terribly cliche for parents to say to people who don't want kids 'oh but you'll change your minds' - I don't think that its true for everyone in either direction but I am glad I chose this path.   You might be like me, who didn't want kids now couldn't really see a different life.  But there is nothing wrong with not having kids, or having them (I've always found the pressure from either side to usually come from individuals who need to be a bit more honest about why they're giving 'advice').  \n\nI'm a bit older (40) as well so think I have the finances to give the kid a good life - we'll see how much I'm singing that tune when I'm mid 50's and she's a teenager ;)",

In this case, the survey was carried out during the pandemic lockdowns and shortly after the assassination of George Floyd, two factors that are likely to correlate with lower life satisfaction and decreased the real effect of having or not having children. As an example, on one year the levels of life satisfaction measured in the World Happiness Report skyrocketed. The reasons was not the world becoming happier, but simply asking them *before* the politics questions rather than after. Therefore, I would be very very careful with the results of this study, I don’t think anything has been shown here.
