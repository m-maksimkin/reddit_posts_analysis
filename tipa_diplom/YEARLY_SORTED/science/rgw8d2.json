One of those facts is that tobacco plants become contaminated with radon gas, both naturally occurring and from radium content in fertilizers. The radon gas gets stuck in the hairy fibers on the tobacco plant. It then decays to Lead-210 and Polonium-210, which are toxic, radioactive heavy metals. These metals survive processing of the plants and make it into cigarettes and eventually into the lungs of smokers. Polonium-210 is an alpha emitter and very damaging inside the body. The annual dose it contributes to the lungs of a smoker is slightly higher than what the average person receives in annual background dose from cosmic or terrestrial radiation. Basically, if you smoke a pack a day, you're getting double the dose of the average person, with half of that dose delivered internally and primarily to the lung tissue. \n\nMy point is, cannabis plants act similarly I'm sure, as do many other plants.
