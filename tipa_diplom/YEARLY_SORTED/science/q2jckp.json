This means women are more likely to be more passive, compassionate, sensitivity to negative emotions, but the main trait I want to hone in on, is a combination between interest in people & compassion.  Our society values compassion and an interest in people, so specifically compassion toward other human beings, to the point where its hard for people to see any negative of this trait, and any one who has the opposite of this trait is seen as 'bad'.   Compassion, empathy, towards others is good in that it allows you to relate to others, so it often leads to people trying to help others.  Ability to be sensitive to negative emotion is great in that you can foresee potential dangers, combined with empathy, you can see how those dangers would be extremely harmful to oneself \\[and others\\].    This can lead to extreme codependent behavior, the need to take care of others, in order for oneself to not feel the negative emotions from empathy.  While codependence is terrible, due to the need of control, and inability to be in control of oneself, its not even the worst result of this behavior.  The worst is the denial of allowing individuals to take risks, especially kids.  Part of growing up, is leaving the nest and taking risks, ignoring the danger and learning first hand just how dangerous the world can be.  This creates naïve entitled children.   Additionally, being lower in compassion enables one to be more assertive, and being assertive, or even aggressive isn't inherently bad.  Its actually needed to survive, and our society deems this trait as evil.  Which is is not evil, not any more then compassion is inherently good, they can be bad, and they can be good.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis ties to the study in that, any one who challenges a child of a mother who exhibits behaviors like these, to take on the world, adopt responsibility, grow up to adulthood, take risks, will come off as evil, and the reason why their 'baby' is taking on the dangers of the world.  Seeing their child take on such dangers can be horrifying for someone who is extremely sensitive to negative emotion, and highly empathetic.  I think our society really needs to learn that these traits can be good, but can just as easily be terrible and stunt the growth of children.",

I’m basing that on the fact that they were all signed up for emails about estrangement. Moreover, I would assume it is a self-defined estrangement on their part since it’s just an email list. The sample should reflect the population of all mothers estranged with children not just ones on an email list about it. I feel like the type of mother who would be more likely to join an email list about such a thing would probably be more likely to be narcissistic or something like that. There could well be other reasons why mother and child are estranged that is not getting represented in the sample.",

I personally think the data doesn't really tell the whole truth. I have personal experience with this. My parents divorced when I was 3, and I finally left her when I was 12. Its been 13 years now and I have no plan to see her. She did very inappropriate things that shaped me at a young age and the older I get the angrier it makes me. Like taking LSD and insisting we watch Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\", and Sin City when I was 7 years old. Widely insane to do that with multiple young children in the house. But I know for a fact she blames the rest of my family for my estrangement. And I know that she is the sole reason why.\n\n\"For example, there are generational differences in what parents and children view as appropriate parenting behavior. Perspectives on what is considered abusive, harmful, neglectful or traumatizing behavior have shifted over the past three decades. What was once seen as normal behavior may be viewed as abusive or neglectful today,” Schoppe-Sullivan said. “Each generation sees things differently now and we have to help them bridge that gap if they want to repair that relationship.”\n\nThis reads as though the children share responsibility for explaining acts of abuse and neglect to their parents to make amends. The thought of doing that makes me sick. Someone told me this one time when I was young, and it stays with me still: Anyone can have a kid, raising them well takes someone special. Parents aren't entitled to their children. If you have a kid you should be responsible for raising them appropriately.",

Understanding parents’ attributions for estrangement is critical—parents’ willingness to make necessary changes to facilitate reconciliation may depend on how they make sense of their adult children’s reasons for estrangement. This study used quantitative data from an online survey conducted in 2019 and completed by 1,035 mothers currently estranged from one or more of their adult children. We explored mothers’ endorsement of attributions for estrangement, the demographic correlates of their endorsement of attributions, and the relations of their endorsement of attributions to current levels of contact with estranged children. Results indicated that about half of mothers reported no contact at all since the estrangement began, and over half reported that it had been at least 1 year since they had any contact with their adult children. These mothers tended to endorse external attributions for estrangement, including family members’ turning the child against them (e.g., child’s other biological parent or adult child’s romantic partner) or children’s struggles with mental illness and/or addiction. Mothers were less likely to endorse internal attributions for estrangement compared with external attributions or to validate their children’s complaints about abuse or neglect. Results are discussed in the context of changes in parent–child relationships across generations; implications for future research and clinical work with estranged parents are also discussed.",

I suffer from both anxiety and depression both of which I don't want to pass on to my child nor have her deal with my own childhood baggage.

Often the alienating parent is borderline or narcissistic and as such is quite adept at emotional manipulation tactics. They learn to elicit negative responses about the targeted parent and then reinforce the responses. Over time the child comes to believe the stories they tell. Finally the deed is done. In alienated children they lose the ability to experience empathy for the targeted parent which can result in cruel behavior towards the targeted parent (which is gleefully reinforced by the alienating parent). All in all it is a form of subtle child abuse which has many negative consequences for the child. If you experienced this you should read Divorce Poison or clinical woks by Dr. Childress to better understand what happened. And get a therapist who understands parental alienation.",

He made fun of me as a young teen for being fat, and idolized my younger brother for being good at sports. Now I'm thin and my brother is dead of alcohol and drug abuse, so...In the last few years he became a Trumpist and hoarded silver coins. My religious mother thought he might be possessed.   When we stopped talking altogether these past 20 years he blamed my mother and then my wife. He met my children just twice, and I took pains to keep it that way. I don't know if he blamed me; but he never asked and I never answered. He almost certainly never blamed himself. \n\nHe died last year, and in his last week of life used his lawyer to remove all of my brothers, mother, and me - good and bad relationships alike- from his will to give his homes and things to his girlfriend, who promptly sold the place and beat town, which is...fine. The people he kept in his life were the people he paid and whose loyalty could be purchased.  If he thought he could reach me from the grave he is mistaken.  I'll be fine. I just doubled down on being a better parent.",
