In my country I would consider the people in charge of that particular body as barely literate. I'd be shocked if they can read papers in English or are up to date with current scientific developments. Most of those position are political. Say they do approve it, after some months (years?) of reviewing. Then it has to go to the central government and be approved by another politician in the budget for the next quarter (unless it's an emergency like covid, and even then there were significant delays in payment to Pfizer). Said politician is probably more concerned about his next yacht. So whose fault is it?

At some point it becomes cost-prohibitive (ie you're incurring a signficant loss with every unit of drug sold).\n\nThat said, it is a significant bioethics issue that they are testing drugs in these areas - first, who is overseeing the well-being of the people being tested in disadvantaged areas? Is there enough oversight?  (If you have to run a clinical trial in the west, there's a lot of oversight - that same standard needs to be applied. If it's not, or if the trial participants haven't given informed consent, and/or been adequately compensated - these are all major issues.)\n\nTL;DR: While the choice of where to sell drugs is a market issue, the treatment and protection of trial subjects is a bioethics issue.  Is enough being done to ensure that they aren't being taken advantage of?",

Those nations cannot afford to access the drugs, which is a legitimate concern in itself, especially in a global pandemic in which the disease is not under control until it is arrested everywhere. (I reside in one of the African countries where covid vaccines are not available. I can afford the vaccines, but it's not like I can order a dose from Amazon. Pharmaceutical companies require bulk purchases.)\n\nBut, an even greater bioethic issues would be making the drugs available without trialing among those populations.",

Lower exposure risk means that far more participants are needed to get a meaningful result. This is also the reason why studies regarding most covid vaccines were initially carried out in countries like Brazil or the US, while nearly none were conducted in Europe. Last summer's numbers of infections simply made it less viable.\n\nThat obviously does not solve the ethical issue created by not making these drugs available in said countries, but it's not like some comments here suggesting, that these companies just do that because they perceive these lives as 'less worthy'.",

            "text": "I work at a large pharma company that focuses on innovating and creating new drugs.\n\nWhile this is true sometimes, we sometimes have issues finding enough people to test in other countries. Also, the reason these drugs are often not available in those countries is that the process of getting people to test the drug ist VERY easy in a lot of cases. It takes time and money to run studies, so you want these to be as fast and cheap as possible so you can provide the drug as fast as you can, which is important because the patent only lasts for 10 years after which the massive amount of generics make it nearly impossible to compete. \n\nSo after the studies are done, where do you register your drug first? Obviously in the must-win-markets, as you make the most money there. These are: North America (Canada, USA and Mexico), Europe (the EU, and now the UK too) China, South Korea, Japan and Australia. Those are always the first ones. \n\nYou might say that this is greedy but think about this: creating a new drug costs BILLIONS. And it takes time, at least a few years, sometimes over a decade. It's also very risky, as you don't know if the drug is going to really work, let alone work well, until you're deep into phase II studies. At this point, the research already costs Billions so if you don't want to go bankrupt, you need make up for all that, and that in less than 10 years. That is a lot of pressure. So the drug will be expensive to make up for it. Otherwise, no new drugs will be developed and a lot of people will lose their jobs. So you start the registration process. First in the countries that make the most money. After that, the countries with the most amount of medical need in relation to the affordability. I worked sometime in regulatory affairs. These registrations can take years. Sometimes they get delayed, sometimes they get canceled. Every country has a different registration process, so it can be tricky. You try again you might only be able to sell the drug for the last 2 years before the patent runs out. A lot of the time, registration processes in small countries were still going on and at the same time, the production of the product got cancelled due to lacking profitability, as the patent ran out and generics flooded the market. So yes, this is an issue, but it's not like we're doing this because we're evil.\n\nOn the other hand, we have sustainability goals to help people in developing countries get access to medication and birthcontrol. We plan to provide over 100 million poeple with access to medication and 100 million woman access to birthcontrol by the year 2025. We already achieve nearly half of those goals today so we're on a good road. We work towards the sustainability goals of the UN and we are fighting global hunger and that everyone can get the drugs they need. Not everything is perfect, but we are trying.",
