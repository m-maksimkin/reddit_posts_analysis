            "text": "TLDR: \n\n **Senescent cells increase with age, driving multiple chronic diseases like cancer, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer's. A vaccine that targets these cells reverses aspects of aging in mice with normal and accelerated aging** \n\n- Senolytic drugs are known to remove senescent cells that drive age-related diseases, are are being studied in over a dozen human trials by the [Mayo Clinic for COVID-19](https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/senolytics-reduce-covid-19-symptoms-in-preclinical-studies/), frailty, and [accelerated aging in childhood cancer survivors](https://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jgs.17461)\n\n- Senolytics can have off-target effects, so in this paper the authors ask - what if a potentially safer vaccination approach was taken instead? \n\n- The authors identify GPNBM, a protein expressed more highly in senescent cells, and created a vaccine against \nthat protein to allow the immune system to safely and selectively clear these dysfunctional cells. \n\n[Full text paper published in Nature Aging\n](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QcQ03CC98rkbxwe19N0ltUkN6KSasOCs/view)\n\n> We demonstrated that elimination of Gpnmb-positive cells by vaccination could improve HFD-induced atherogenesis and metabolic dysfunction in mice. Eliminating such cells also ameliorated normal and pathological aging in aged mice and prolonged the lifespan of mice with premature aging.\n\nIncreased survival in progeroid mice is important because it suggests that aging is delayed and/or partly reversed. [Aging leads to multiple chronic diseases](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.10.039), so slowing aging delays the onset of *all* chronic diseases, simultaneously. This is unique to medicines that target aging.\n\n\n\n**Why is aging biology research important for healthcare?**\n\n[Age is the largest risk factor for many chronic diseases](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41574-020-0335-y) like Alzheimer's, stroke, and cancer. Traditionally, aging biology has been ignored in mainstream medical research. Research in animals suggests that targeting aging is far more efficient than treating diseases one at a time. Scientists attempting to slow/reverse aging aren't typically focusing on increasing lifespans, but on increasing [healthspans, life spent *free* of disease](https://imgur.com/gallery/RGTqw8P)\n\nGlobal populations are aging, for the 1st time in history, we have [more people > 64 than we have children < 5](https://ourworldindata.org/population-aged-65-outnumber-children). COVID-19 is a recent example of the vulnerability of our society to a biologically older population, i.e. immune aging.\n\n**To visualise what increased healthspan looks like, see the [mice that came out of research from the Mayo Clinic on senolytics](https://imgur.com/gallery/P66ZoJX)**\n\nFrom a healthcare/economics perspective it is simply a 'no-brainer' for us to intervene on biological aging, [according to estimates of healthcare cost savings from slowing aging](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/abs/10.1377/hlthaff.2013.0052?journalCode=hlthaff). A more recent attempt to model the healthcare/economic benefit to society, after also accounting for COVID-19, was [published by Harvard Medical School's David Sinclair](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00080-0) with two economics professors:\n\n> We show that a compression of morbidity that improves health is more valuable than further increases in life expectancy, and that targeting aging offers potentially larger economic gains than eradicating individual diseases. We show that a slowdown in aging that increases life expectancy by 1 year is worth US$38 trillion, and by 10 years, US$367 trillion.\n\nJoin /r/longevity to follow this research :)\n\nSee https://longevitywiki.org/wiki/Aging_and_Longevity for more detail",
