In particular, Egan found himself \"gobsmacked by the level of scientific illiteracy\" in the magazine's coverage of Roger Shawyer's \"electromagnetic drive\", where New Scientist allowed the publication of \"meaningless double-talk\" designed to bypass a fatal objection to Shawyer's proposed space drive, namely that it violates the law of conservation of momentum. Egan urged others to write to New Scientist and pressure the magazine to raise its standards, instead of \"squandering the opportunity that the magazine's circulation and prestige provides\". The editor of New Scientist, then Jeremy Webb, replied defending the article, saying that it is \"an ideas magazine—that means writing about hypotheses as well as theories\".",
