My life has been a series of buying property in nice working class neighborhoods and then selling when the Teslas and Porches move in around me. It’s worked out fairly well financially so far. Obviously I’m not one of the poorest; I buy rather than rent, etc, but I really do prefer to be around people who know what it’s really like to do without. I have a good gov job that doesn’t require a degree, and I’m lucky. I prefer to be around working class folks. It’s not always the case, of course, but folks help each other out and act less entitled. When the chips are down, you can’t trust rich folks not to fold up and act wrong, as stressed out humans tend to do. Where I am now is a working class neighborhood with some crime issues. Gentrification will no doubt make its way over here to the Western outskirts of Atlanta proper. I hate to see all of my neighbors, many of whom have been here for decades and are the best kind of Americans, lose the ability to stay here and have a community they love to call home. And, I do not think that rich folks moving in and raising prices really reduces crime. We’re seeing the worst violent crime in the richest parts of town now, and I think that’s gentrification’s inevitable comeuppance. Poor folks don’t just go away, and making their lives more expensive just causes stress and an increase in crime, especially from young folks acting out from frustration in such an environment. I’m not sure America has the soul for it, but we need to be providing OPPORTUNITIES for folks in working class communities. It would help us all. The teachers here are phenomenal and are working with far too few resources. We tap into the pole on school property for out fiber internet, but the school has no access to it. Kids don’t have school supplies. Many are hungry. Most of us don’t realize how hard it is to think straight if you’re hungry and stressed.

The best example I like to provide is the extreme disruption of local control over schools.  Traditionally schools are one of the best political venues for non-white communities to organize around and gain a modicum of political power that they can leverage toward great political office and social change.\n\nFearing urban non-whites mobilizing in such a manner state governments will point to social ills that are the result of generations long racist policy, poverty, crime, and low social mobility as justification for a school takeover by the state government.  They will dissolve or depower local elected officials, appoint a state official to oversee things, and then start disrupting communities by closing schools, opening charters, firing swaths of people, and using the political isolation of the state power to break contracts with local service providers and unions.  \"The Prize: Who is in Charge of America's Schools\" is a good book that illustrates the practice in action in Newark, even if it is not an academic text.\n\nGentrification is not a handful of well to do rich people moving into the city.  It is a series of policy decisions that exist to disrupt, depower, and scatter urban communities.\n\n(I just wrote a 7,000 word paper on this, and my professors are looking to see what I might have to hammer out to get it published).",

I think part of the issue is how they've sort of leaned into this weird race essentialism and rely on assumptions to validate their theories. Gentrification is literally creating generational wealth for many minorities. While not all poor in those areas own property, many do!!! Guess what? That means the old Hispanic or Asian immigrant now had a $1 million property to pass on to their kids. This happens all the time from gentrification. A lot of the lefts narrative around gentrification as it relates to culture seems to lean on the same arguments that white nationalists use for immigration. Many white progressives are so fixated on infantilizing minorities that they aren't interested in exploring any other narratives. This leads to huge blind spots when discussing complex issues",
