    "Study: 87% of excess lung cancer risk eliminated if smokers quit before age 45. Among more than 400,000 Americans researchers followed, smokers died of cancer at three times the rate of nonsmokers. However, smokers who managed to quit by age 45 lowered that excess risk by 87%.\n": [

She was single, and I had two small children, so I think she held on for them. We took her to all of her doctor's appointments, on little excursions, and grocery shopped for her. We saw her every day that wasn't a \"sleep day\". She had a routine with her chemo. Whenever she'd start to get anxious about it, we talk about just the next thing. \"What's the next thing?\" That was the sole focus.  She lost her hair, which she wasn't thrilled about, but got used to, and her world was very small. Finally she was in hospice for almost two months before she passed away on a beautiful September day. My kids were 4 and 2. I was 36 when I lost my precious mom.

Suffering, i.e. true suffering where you are hospitalized (institutionalized) and dependent on the care of others is something NO ONE ever wants to experience. I say thins from experience and it is an extremely hard point to get other people to realize before it's too late. If everyone could experience what that's like, it would greatly increase their chance of quitting for good. The mere fear of going back to that would be enough to keep cravings at bay. \n\nWith all that said, nicotine is a powerfully addictive drug and will do it's best to convince you not to quit. The good news is, just like every addictive drug, it can be overcame through cessation. \n\nI consider myself very lucky to experience the suffering I mentioned above in my early 30s. It was a horrendous experience and caused me to quit easily after being a very heavy smoker. I actually feel like that life threatening event saved my life. It's a weird feeling to be glad I went through it.
