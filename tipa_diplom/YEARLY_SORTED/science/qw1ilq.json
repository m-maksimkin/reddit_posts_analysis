They used chemical structures of existing drugs of abuse to generate other structures for potential drugs of abuse. \n\nThe problem I see is that the relevant CNS receptors (targets of these drugs of abuse) seem to have been ignored here, and the receptor-ligand interaction makes a massive difference in the ultimate behavioral/phenomenological effect of the ligand in question.\n\nConsider LSD, a type of ergoline. There are remarkably few chemical modifications that can be made to LSD that also preserve its hallucinogenic properties. These modified compounds may still bind with comparable affinity to 5-HT2A (main receptor implicated in the hallucinogenic effects of substances like LSD, mescaline, and psilocybin), but do not produce any hallucinogenic effects. An example comes to mind, namely erogotamine, which is chemically very similar to LSD, binds with high affinity to 5-HT2A, but has no hallucinogenic effects. In fact, ergotamine is used in the treatment of migraines.\n\nPoint being it’s really difficult to predict the subjective effects of a psychotropic compound from chemical structure alone. That being the case I would approach their results with skepticism, but also optimism. Neural network can be a powerful tools in the right situations, and I can only assume they’ll have more and more to offer neuroscience as our models (and, by implication, our understanding) of the brain’s various functions become more sophisticated.",

Are they biologically active at all? Can they be cleared by the liver/kidneys without damaging them? Can they be synthesized efficiently (or at all)? The list of requirements goes on and on.

So the U.S. Congress passed a law banning any and all substances used to \"alter the state of consciousness\" of any user.\n\nBut the law of unintended consequences took over.  Now people can be prosecuted for hyperventilating, for holding their breath till they pass out, for drowning, for being knocked unconscious, for drinking coffee, tea, beer, or wine, for doing anything that changes one's state of consciousness in any way.  They had to amend the law to include intent.  So then it read \"intentionally altering one's state of consciousness\".  But in theory, it still included taking caffeine, alcohol, and even hyperventilation.\n\nBy 1986, Congress managed to pass what is now known as the Analog Law - a stripped down version meant to prevent such abuses - but is largely considered by prosecutors as too vague to be useful because it requires the user to know all about advanced chemistry.\n\n>For a law to be used in court, the defendant must have known he did something illegal.  \n>  \n>Analog Act cases have lost in court after the defense argues that the accused had no idea the drug was \"substantially similar\" to another, already outlawed one. It's complicated chemistry, and if expert witnesses cannot agree, how was the defendant to know?  \n>  \n>\"They can say they did not knowingly violate the law,\" Ruddy said.\n\nhttps://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/designer-drugs-slip-past-prosecution/1256060/",
