I try my best to explain the situation to them but I wish there was more of a global narrative going on. I’m not sure anyone really realizes how impactful this is unless they don’t frequent a place like Starbucks (who buys a year worth of coffee at once)\n\nI’ve switched to all compostable and plastic-free products as much as I can. Giving my customers a discount incentive when they bring their own cup in. Plus buying the most sustainable coffees I can afford. I feel like if I don’t take it seriously, then who will? But the writing seems to be on the wall regardless.\n\nEdit: typo",

So warming temperatures will move the best conditions up hill where there is less acreage.  But there are other coffee plants that thrive in tropical lowlands.\n\nBut what typically happens is that the best conditions for a plant will move, rather than disappear.  For instance, wheat, oats, barley and other agricultural grasses are vulnerable to mold and rust.  Climate change move their best growing conditions north into new areas.  And the areas no longer suitable for growing grasses can grow other crops, like corn and soybeans.  And areas no longer suitable for corn can now grow cotton.  Canada is poised to become the great food basket of the Western world.  Russia also owns vast areas that may become suitable for agricultural grasses.\n\nGetting back to coffee, the plants take many years before they produce beans.  Thus, our biggest adaptation problem is growing speed.",
