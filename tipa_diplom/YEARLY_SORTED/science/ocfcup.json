            "text": "To be fair to everyone who assumed that feeding plastics to cows was the answer, that is completely understandable to think given the way the post is worded.   \nCows gut breaks down plastic. This serves as a sustainable method of recycling.  \nI thought exactly the same thing. My partner immediately thought of \"cool, so if we can harvest and grow those microbes, then we'll have something to eat those plastics.\"  \nPsssh, potato potahto I say.   \n\n\nThe other thing with cows is that the methane they are producing is already in the environment so to speak. IE it's cycling through them via their food and then into the atmosphere, back to the food. While the increase is still concerning becuase we have more than what the earth adjusted to previously, but it still gets recycled eventually.\n\nUnlike humans who took a many thousands year old substance that had not adjusted to the ecosystem due to being absent and in the ground and now pumping it into the atmosphere like mad that also has different charactestics than bio created methane like ruminants and wetlands produce.  \n\n\nStill an issue to work out, but not at the expense of ignoring the glaring elephant in the room. Spotlights can be in many places, always frustrating to see them only shining in one area of consequence.  \n\n\nNow to figure out how to grow and culture those microbes and then figure out if there are downsides to releasing them into the oceans/land, possibly even human bodies? We still have the micro plastic problem that's literally everywhere. Dunno if these guys are small enough to consume those too or if they are the same type of plastic.",

I'm envisaging, for example, plastic eating microbes being released into the ocean or getting into the general environment as an attempt to remove plastic waste from the environment. Once that's done, it won't really be possible to undo, and plastic waste, in general, would start getting eaten.  \n  \nWe produce, globally, around 300 million tonnes of plastic waste per year. Global CO2 emissions are around 30 billion tonnes. If plastic waste is getting eaten, ultimately this could just be a straight up 1% bump in CO2 emissions when we're trying to minimise them.",
