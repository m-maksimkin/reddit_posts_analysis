I’ve had opportunities to get married but it just seemed like too big of a commitment at the time. If I met the right person, I would definitely consider it at this point in my life, but the longest I’ve gone without being sexually active has maybe been about two or three months since I first started having sex back as a teenager.

This meant Japanese workers had less buying power and personal time. This meant Japanese people had to live more in groups and with their families meaning they didn't have the ability to have the personal space and time to raise a family.\n\n\nIn the United States, wage theft has been the primary method of workers losing buying power. Even though productivity and profits are at an all-time high, people are working longer hours and having to live with uncomfortable situations with either their family or people they don't really get along with in order to live. This lack of personal privacy and freedom and wealth building means that people aren't in a situation to raise a family or even have a romantic partner. \n\n\n\nWe know the solutions to these problems. We have plenty of countries around the world who set up systems for their people in order to raise a thriving family. But that cuts into profits and rich people don't like that.

Watching shows from the 90s and 00s and hearing people say, “your place or mine?” is an alien concept. Also, being poor and investing some much time into education and work kills the opportunity to develop relationships. Another statistic I remember hearing is how reliant those who are sexually active are on tech to find hookups. So not only are young adults not having sex, when they are they can’t be bothered to develop romantic relationships. They’re just hooking up and skipping to the naked time. \n\nI think this is damning evidence of how difficult young adulthood is for younger generations. Being on the low end of the millennial spectrum, I’ve seen this trend develop with my generation and watched older Gen Z inherit the problem.",

Women used to go out to social gatherings and engage a bit to get the validation they get from people finding them attractive and now they can just swipe on an app and get hundreds of matches that they mostly ignore. Men and women both claim to hate the dating apps but almost none of them are making an effort to change their habits. The younger generations are even worse off now. Covid just accelerated this societal rot. I'm a firm believer that the statistic that younger generations are having far less sex than their parents comes down because dating apps (and now covid) have kept people from social gatherings and parties where younger people have traditionally hooked up. I also believe social media has made people more awkward and afraid of social interaction in the real world. We close ourselves off more and stay in the familiar because we become used to getting all our validation through that. Why would you need to plan a social gathering or party to see all your friends if you talk to them every day anyways. Something's gonna give in a generation probably and I anticipate we might see another version of the \"Summer of '68\" sorta scenerio where people just disconnect.

Women are taught to either hide or commodify themselves and men are mostly taught their desires are revolting unless they are the embodiment of ‘chad’ (I hate using that term btw), or it’s ok as long as they pay. \n\nIn my opinion I think social media, internet, technology etc. has greatly weakened the social abilities and openness of younger generations. People live their life partly online, so many people also exclusively live their sexual life online as well.

But as a 28 year old, I honestly think the issue is dating apps and what they have done to men’s confidence to approach women, and women’s acceptance of romantic approaches out in the “real world”.\n\nAnd I’m not saying this as someone from an advantaged position - when I was dating, it took me forever to get over my own fear of rejection (and to be honest I still think about the rejection sometimes, it’s a skill you have to practice for me). Additionally, apps have created a go-to funnel for all that dating activity, and once normal environments for asking girls out have become inappropriate (gyms, cafes, grocery stores, etc.). Or at least that funnel creates a mental block for men. The only place to ask people out anymore are apps, clubs, and bars.\n\nThrow Covid into the mix when bars and clubs are closed for a year, and app dating which makes a lot of relatively average dudes unnattractive in the eyes of girls (because there are so many more good options), you have a lot of people not being able to date for the last two years. \n\nI hope this doesn’t come across as red-pill-y. It’s just my experience. I think if those same men who are not dating gained more confidence and started asking women out in more normal settings, they wouldn’t have this issue as much. That unfortunately keeps the same old gender-norms of guys asking girls out, but women do have most of the power in the dating market these days.",

But that has changed in recent years. Since 2008, the share of men younger than 30 reporting no sex has nearly tripled, to 28 percent. That’s a much steeper increase than the 8 percentage point increase reported among their female peers.\n\nThere are several potential explanations for this, Twenge said. Labor force participation among young men has fallen, particularly in the aftermath of the last recession. Researchers also see a “connection between labor force participation and stable relationships,” she said.\n\nThe survey showed, for instance, that 54 percent of unemployed Americans didn’t have a steady romantic partner, compared with 32 percent among the employed.\n\nYoung men also are more likely to be living with their parents than young women: In 2014, for instance, 35 percent of men age 18 to 34 were living in their parents’ home, compared with 29 percent of women in that age group. At the risk of stating the obvious, “when you’re living at home it’s probably harder to bring sexual partners into your bedroom,” Twenge said.\n\nOne final factor that may be affecting Americans’ sexual habits at all ages is technology. “There are a lot more things to do at 10 o’clock at night now than there were 20 years ago,” Twenge said. “Streaming video, social media, console games, everything else.”\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/29/share-americans-not-having-sex-has-reached-record-high/",

Like four to a two bedroom. And you let your roommate have the bedroom and you’re on the couch or elsewhere. Added benefit is a bunch of young people in this situation means every friend also lives with multiple people so wind up with a lot more social interaction.

Although internet sites and social media should theoretically make it easier to find new sexual partners, time spent online has also displaced time once spent on face-to-face social interaction.5 Even when individuals interact face to face, mobile technology such as smartphones may interfere with the satisfaction that people derive from in-person interaction .6 The neologism phubbing describes a social interaction in which one partner pulls out his/her phone, thus snubbing the other partner. This behavior may be especially problematic in romantic relationships, in which it is associated with lower relationship satisfaction.7 Between the 24-hour availability of entertainment and the temptation to use smartphones and social media, sexual activity may not be as attractive as it once was. Put simply, there are now many more choices of things to do in the late evening than there once were and fewer opportunities to initiate sexual activity if both partners are engrossed in social media, electronic gaming, or binge watching.\n\nTL;DR: There's a lot more cheap entertainment that makes sex less appealing.",

I was shocked by the responses - because they were teens. I also thought it was cool they saw people as more multifacited individuals than simple objects of desire.\n\nI was surprised, but thinking about it, I had always wondered if people were lying in these surveys, consciously or subconsciously, recalling, estimating and entering what they felt culture expected of them. Even asking someone to manually track their activity along the year will risk them changing it up to prove they fit with cultural expectations. Maybe the decline in acceptance of objectification and sexualization across media has made a dent in cultural expectations.\n\nI wonder if at some point, boink time will be calculated by smart devices around us.
