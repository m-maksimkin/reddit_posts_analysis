In his dystopian work, *The Republic*, he described a hypothetical society in which children were separated from their parents at birth to be raised collectively and asserted that this alone would be sufficient to restructure all of society.  Upon reading *The Republic*, I had always been sceptical that eliminating familial connections would be sufficient to establish lasting collectivism.  This mongoose result, while hardly conclusive, (any number of other factors might be different between mongoose and human that also play a role in a less visible way) tips the scale further in Plato's favor that child rearing structures society.\n\nThe title, describing this in terms of \"equitable mongoose society\" (3 words I certainly never expected to see together), however, is a highly politically charged framing of the point.  Just for contrast, here is an equally political framing of the same phenomenon from the point of view of the political right: *'Mongoose society has collapsed into collectivism as a result of the abandonment of typical mammalian family structure.'*  See how the use or non-use of terms like 'family', 'collectivism', and 'equity' allow a political subtext to seep into something as innocuous as mongoose breeding and child rearing habits?",

I couldn't get to the original article, but from the description it looks like circular reasoning to me -- we assume that since mongoose give birth at the same time and treat non-biologically related struggling pups with more care, that they must not be able to identify their biological offspring.  Then we are concluding that since they don't know their own offspring, they are more equitable.  We are using the outcome to define the cause, and the cause to explain the outcome.  It is entirely possible that they can identify their own offspring, but adaptive pressures have led them not to prioritize individual biology over group survival.\n\nEdited:  by \"original article\" I meant the research report, by \"description\" I meant the article the OP posted.

In most hunter gatherer societies and social primates most resembling humans this behavior has evolved as the most beneficial. In many tribes the idea of \"father\" and \"mother\" is applied collectively to the whole tribe which leads to a comparatively beneficial psychological environment for kids. Everyone has a clear idea of belonging and kids have improved survival chances by having several males and females taking a stake in their future.\n\nThey argue that the idea of  the pre-historical human social contract being a division of labor where 1 man protects and gathers food for his kids which are nurtured by one woman couldn't be further from what the evidence implies. This idea's prevalence, which they call the \"standard story\" has more to do with western anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists being  influenced by their own cultural norms than with hard science.",

I was taught that all living creatures have their own clans, customs, languages and unique powers or abilities, and that I should respect them as equals to humans.
