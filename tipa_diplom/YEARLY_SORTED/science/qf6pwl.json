            "text": "Full Text:\n\n> A 16-year study of US sperm donors shows that sperm quality has been steadily declining, possibly due to increased chemical exposure and lifestyle changes.\n\n> Chelsea Canon at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, a fertility clinic, and her colleagues looked at more than 170,000 semen analyses conducted between 2005 and 2021 for healthy 19 to 38-year-olds from nine geographic regions across the US. The researchers say the data comes from a “diverse set” of men, although it is unclear how representative it is of the US population.\n\n> Across all regions, the researchers found that the average concentration of sperm in donated semen dropped over time. The average number of mobile sperm in the semen – which is a better predictor of their potential to fertilise eggs – also declined.\n\n> The results, which were presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, on 20 October, are consistent with studies showing that sperm quality is also declining in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\n\n> Increased exposure to air pollution and chemicals known as endocrine disruptors could be driving this trend, as well as lifestyle factors such as obesity, smoking, lack of exercise and stress, says Ryan Smith at the University of Virginia.\n\n> Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that can mimic our hormones and interfere with their normal function. They are found in pesticides, food packaging, cosmetics and other everyday products, with growing evidence suggesting they can affect sperm quality.\n\n> At this stage, it is unclear if declining sperm quality is making it harder to have children, says Smith. Birth rates are slipping in many countries and more people require IVF to get pregnant, but there could be many other factors explaining this, like people trying to conceive at older ages when fertility naturally wanes, he says.\n\n> “All we can say is that we’re seeing declining sperm count – how that pertains to the bigger picture of fertility really needs further clarification.”\n\n> Nevertheless, Smith believes that the use of endocrine disruptors should be more tightly regulated by governments to minimise their possible effects on sperm health.\n\n> There are also ways that individuals can improve their sperm health, for example by eating better, exercising more and quitting smoking, says Smith. “The life cycle of sperm is about 70 days, so you can turn things around within a few months,” he says.",

            "text": "Hi all - founder of a sperm company here ([www.givelegacy.com](https://www.givelegacy.com)). \n\n**I have some context to start:**\n\n1. This is an abstract of a study performed by RMA New York. They are one of the top fertility clinics in the country (I've met with their team several times) so it is a reasonably trusted source. I know two of the authors, Dr. Alan Copperman (whose name is misspelled here!) and Dr. Natan Bar Chama, who are experts in what they do. They are not first-authors, so likely oversaw the work vs. doing it themselves. \n\n2. Fertility & Sterility is the gold standard journal in the reproductive space.. Here is the original study, which my team and I have been discussing:\nhttps://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(21)01503-X/fulltext\n\n3. Here are the results from the paper, for those of you who don't have subscriptions:\n\n\"A total of 176,706 SA specimens (from 3,532 unique donors) were analyzed. Controlling for BMI, there was a significant decline in average concentration (M/mL) (β=-1.89, p<0.0001), sperm motility (%) (β=-0.2892, p<0.0001) and total motile sperm (M) (β=-4.53, p<0.0001) over the 16-year study period. There were significant decreases in SA parameters within all geographic regions (Spokane only had two unique donors and could not be examined). Indianapolis showed a significant decrease in sperm concentration and total motile sperm, but also displayed an increase in sperm motility over the study period.\"\n\n4. This is broadly aligned with the findings of the seminal (pun intended) meta-study in 2017 by Dr. Shanna Swan, Dr. Hagai Levine, and others, showing 50-60% declines in sperm counts and concentration in Western men over the past 40 years. \n\nNow, **why is this happening?** \n\nA few of the people on my team who have weighed in (internally):\n1. Dr. Ramy Abou Ghayda, urologist (and our Chief Medical Officer)\n2. Dr. Felipe Navarrete, sperm motility expert (and our Head of Research)\n3. Stephanie Keller, RN, who has 10+ years experience in male fertility (our Head of Nursing)\n\n**A few thoughts:\n**\n1. We don't *really* know the exact cause. It's shocking how little we know about sperm, and reproduction more broadly. But there are a few theories. \n\n2. The most compelling is the presence of phthalates, BPA, endocrine disruptors. \"They are hormone disruptors: BPA and phthalates interfere with the body's normal use of hormones; not just estrogen and testosterone, but thyroid and adrenal hormone production as well\". These are found in plastics, shower curtains, ATM receipts, the food we eat, the beverages we drink, you name it. I believe this is also a contributor to the decline in testosterone levels (and a few folks mentioned earlier puberty, irregular periods, etc. which I believe is linked)\n\n2. Lifestyles are changing. We're eating more, exercising less, sitting more. Sperm quality is a biomarker of your overall health. As obesity levels increase and people are less health (in the West, especially), it is not surprising to see a corresponding decline in sperm quality. \n\n3. A pet conspiracy theory I have (to be clear, this is NOT yet scientifically proven) is the increase in cell phone usage. I personally believe that these devices, which are around us all day (usually near our groin), are contributing to a decline in fertility and increase in cancer rates. \n\n**A few additional notes:**\n\n1. The studies mentioned, including this one, are very focused on \"WEIRD\" countries (White, Industrialized, Educated, Rich Democratic) i.e. Western countries. This is broadly aligned with declines in birth rates across the Western world. The replacement birth rate in any country is 2.1 babies / women (to account for early infant death). The US is at 1.7 babies per women. German is at 1.54 babies per women. Japan is at 1.36 babies per women (!). \n\n2. The declining birth rate is partially due to biological factors - sperm counts have gone down (as have testosterone levels). Infertility is increasing. As men get older, the rates of genetic mutations increase in sperm approximately 4x as quickly as in eggs (approx. 1 every 8 months) - because men continuously produce sperm while women are born with all the eggs they'll ever have. Most mutations are benign, but it's believed this is why older dads are more likely to have children born with congenital conditions like autism. \n\n3. The declining birth rate is also due to socioeconomic factors. Median ages are going up, people are meeting later, settling down later, and so people are trying to conceive when they're older. Both men and women (or people with sperm and people with ovaries) face ongoing declines in their fertility as they get older. This means a compounding negative effect on couples trying to conceive. We now have more women having their first babies in the 31-35 age range vs. the 26-30 age range. That's new, and a major shift!\n\n4. We now know that men are approximately equally likely to the cause of infertility in heterosexual couples as women - approx 1/3rd is male factor, approx 1/3rd is female factor, and approx 1/3rd is joint or unexplainted. It's not surprising that IVF has become more common among those who can afford it (or who have coverage in states with fertility mandates, like NY or CA). In fact, in Denmark, about 1 in 10 babies is born via IVF due to state subsidies. \n\n**So what to do about it?**\n\nWell, it depends. I used to make fun of my friends who were super \"hippie\" and organic-everything. I am now an ABSOLUTE believer. Chemical free laundry detergent. Organic foods. Fragrance free. I use chemical-minimizing shampoos; and so on. I'm not going to go off-grid anytime soon, and so it's about making the best of the world we live in. \n\nI personally froze my sperm when I was 26 and then founded a company to help others test, improve, and freeze their sperm without having to go to a clinic. Not only is your sperm healthier when you're younger, but it's a way to \"lock in\" your fertility while you have less exposure to chemicals. I plan to use it for IUI or IVF when I'm ready to have kids when I'm older. Sperm can be frozen indefinitely with no loss in quality. \n\nIf you have insurance in NY/CA, or are covered by employer fertility benefits (Progyny, Carrot, Maven, Kindbody, etc.) you can probably get our product for free, so it's worth checking out. We're working quickly on expanding to more states. \n\nOtherwise, there's unfortunately not much we can do without moving to the wilderness - and chemical exposures go down, but bear exposures go up. A mixed blessing.... \n\nHope this helps. We have a TON of [resources](https://www.givelegacy.com/resources) and [guides](https://www.givelegacy.com/male-fertility-guides/). Give me a shout with any further questions.",
