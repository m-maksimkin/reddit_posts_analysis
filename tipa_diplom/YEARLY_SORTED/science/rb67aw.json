Not at www.prisons_suck.com but an actual research source.  Peer reviewed studies published in reputable journals. Prison for most inmates is simply the cost of doing business.  There are a tiny minority of innocent people who get convicted, and they get all the headlines, but the majority of inmates are career criminals who immediately return to crime when they leave prison.  Statistics show that a tiny minority of the population commits the vast majority of crime.  One burglar can rob dozens of homes a week. OK.
