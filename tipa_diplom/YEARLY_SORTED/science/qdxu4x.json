Most posts are about how adorable circles are, which both populations agree on. But a small percentage of posts are about more controversial shapes.

If you program it to only remove posts about squares, then you would naturally expect to see more removals from red people than blue people. But you could also argue that the robot is biased against red people because it is only removing contents associated with that population. Arguing against the bias is to say that the preference for squares is intrinsically wrong and the preference for triangles is intrinsically right, which is to say that the tendencies of the blue population are right and those of the red population are wrong.\n\nPut a less formal way, the entire argument requires one to accept \"there is an objective criteria for offensive content, and that criteria is the one I decide it is\".

These claims are often made while some of the popular facebook pages are conservative. There were many stories detailing how facebook acts when people complain about misinformation: they aim not to appear as biased to conservatives, which results in either ignoring or significantly cutting down on moderation practices suggested either from outside or from their own company. These practices are whittled down so that even if [there's massive problems](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/technology/on-facebook-misinformation-is-more-popular-now-than-in-2016.html) with misinformation, that's preferable to dealing with the threat of punishment from governments. They even banned Trump just before he lost power.\n\n\nPS. I wanted to include this as I was writing this comment but for some reason couldn't find it in my bookmarks.

It was good for a while, having actual content to justify the name, but at some point it became such a toxic conservative echo chamber that it started featuring memes that were straight up conservative and christian propoganda for weeks on end.  If you simply questioned why that was present in a comedy meme app or, without even being political, questioned the simple logic behind their arguments and claims, you would either get blocked from commenting on featured content by the creators who commonly got their political/religious content featured or you would face an army of vile (and very unoriginal) hate comments with little to no real substance.  \n\nI've seen vile behavior from liberals too to be fair, but the thing we all need to accept is that vile people just exist.  Slapping a political title on people doesn't automatically make someone a vile behaviored person.  We tend to focus on the worst of the opposing side because it's validating to assume the opposing side is in majority awful.  Politicized news outlets play so hard on this.

Every news outlet has a bias that favours conservatives and these news outlets will often even endorse specific conservative candidates. The only outlier in our country is the CBC (Canadian broadcasting corporation). The CBC is an independent news outlet funded by federal tax dollars. It has no advertisements or advertising revenue. This is done to remove any bias that may result from the need for revenue. In independent studies done on Canadian media the CBC is the only outlet that is consistently shown to be neutral. Conservatives in Canada want to abolish the CBC because it does not cater to their narrative. They would far sooner take editorial “opinions” from Post media sources as facts. They claim the CBC supports the left but in reality they just report the facts and the facts often do not support the conservative agenda. Any editorials published by the CBC are fact checked and they are written by educated journalists who have no corporate master to serve. This often leads conservatives to conclude there is a bias at the CBC. The truth is that every other news outlet (especially POST media) has a conservative overlord and they are not above showing their bias openly. This is obvious and it is a problem with the media in our country and yet it is ignored by conservatives because they prefer news that caters to their world view. Confirmation bias is a real problem for society and social media has allowed us to create our own echo chambers that further entrench our beliefs. Corporate money in media is also a real problem and often leads to stories being spun to suit an overarching narrative. I often engage with media that is counter to my world view and in some cases it has changed my opinions on key issues. This provides a more nuanced world view.",
