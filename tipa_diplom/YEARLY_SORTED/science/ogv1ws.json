A new study published in “Annals of Behavioral Medicine” looked at the consequences of sleeping fewer than six hours for eight consecutive nights – the minimum duration of sleep that experts say is necessary to support optimal health in average adults.\n\nLead author Soomi Lee, assistant professor in the School of Aging Studies at the University of South Florida, found the biggest jump in symptoms appeared after just one night of sleep loss. The number of mental and physical problems steadily got worse, peaking on day three. At that point, research shows the human body got relatively used to repeated sleep loss. But that all changed on day six, when participants reported that the severity of physical symptoms was at its worst.\n\n“Many of us think that we can pay our sleep debt on weekends and be more productive on weekdays,” Lee said. “However, results from this study show that having just one night of sleep loss can significantly impair your daily functioning.”\n\nData provided by the Midlife in the United States study included nearly 2,000 middle-aged adults who were relatively healthy and well-educated. Among them, 42% had at least one night of sleep loss, sleeping 1 ½ fewer hours than their typical routines. They recorded their mental and physical behaviors in a diary for eight consecutive days, allowing researchers to review how sleep loss causes wear and tear on the body. \n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/abm/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/abm/kaab055/6314765?redirectedFrom=fulltext",

It was her senior year in my junior year, and she had her senior project to present to a panel. She was painting her face with a paintbrush, wearing a feather mask and quoting Shakespeare when I found her.\n\nEventually a teacher came and told her her panel was ready for her to present, and as a junior I was to be part of her panel to see what senior year would look like. She began her presentation just ranting about running shoes and how important they are, and the panel tried to press her about her presentation which was on dolphins.\n\nShe kept ranting about cross-country and quoting Shakespeare, and gave her box of data for her project, which was just dozens of notebook sheets of paper with handwritten ramblings about Adidas, and running,  and just random string of words.\n\nAgain the whole time I thought it was genius, some sort of performance piece but the teachers were seemingly very concerned, and kept asking her probing questions about her actual presentation, which she just deflected with more rants about just nothing. Eventually she just broke down in tears and was screaming about her shoes, that no one was listening to her.\n\nEventually she just devolved into hysteria and they actually had to call an ambulance to come take her away. Medics had to restrain her and she was flailing and biting. Eventually I realized this was not a performance, but a deeply disturbed brain that hasn't slept for days.\n\nThe saddest part is that she was a track star and had a full scholarship to college. But she hadn't eaten anything except dried banana slices for weeks, and wasn't sleeping at all. She had to be admitted to a mental health facility.\n\nI actually don't know what happened to her after that. She was so high performing academically and athletically. It was so sad to see that happened to someone. Too much pressure I think.",

So, basically, can be called to work non-stop for 8 days.\n\nOne extreme week I had 124 hours of work load in those 8 days.  Which, outside of the standard daily 10, was all at random and unpredictable times.\n\nThe days 5, 6, 7 ended up being 16-16.5 hour straight shifts. I remember going to bed at 00:30 exhausted but content that the next day a second/new crew would sign on at 0800 and I'd be covered.\n\nNope, at 03:30 I was called and I remember answering the phone with a rude \"What?!\", the dispatchers were understanding on this on extreme weeks. They said no time to banter, we have an imminent birth.\n\nSo, already 7 days sleep deprived, and with 3 hours sleep, I got up, dressed, and drove to scene.  Delivered a baby on a couch.  In hindsight, we were a bit lucid, and Dispatch knew and we my phone rang during to have a doctor guide me through.\n\nGet to the small rural hospital and stick around with mum/bub for a bit (hospital is understaffed and not suited for neonates). During this we're asked if we can respond to a 12YO short of breath, but reject it and get them to call the other local officers (off duty) to go.  Then told mum/bub need to be transported to larger, regional hospital.  This is a 1.5 hour drive away, and we do so.\n\nWe were advised to consider getting a motel and not come back, which the state would pay for. We just wanted to get home and into our own beds and drove back, changing driver every 10 minutes.  Got back around 10-11am I think, and crashed.\n\nWhen were we back at station, we had straight up short-term/immediate memory loss. Couldn't walk into a room without forgetting why. I remember my partner asking 'is this a blue or black pen?' and I couldn't figure it out myself. In swear I lost the ability to see colour, or even process the question myself.\n\nI should note, that was an extreme 8 days. But not getting a regular night's sleep was rather normal. I worked in that station for 2 years, was paid a fortune in overtime, but I swear I aged 4.",

Then it got to the point where I'd wake up at 530am, go to work, and would need a nap around 2pm. Sometimes I'd take one. Then around 530/600pm I'd need to sleep a bit - sometimes it was up to 2 hours. Even after that I'd go to bed around 9pm and wake up at 530am feeling like I hadn't slept at all.  The odd thing was it pretty much came out of nowhere. Got approved to see a sleep doc right before covid and had my appointment in early March of last year. Crazy time.  \n\n\nGot the machine and it took a week or so to get used to it. I remember the first time I was able to get a solid sleep in. It was on a Sunday. I went to bed earlier than normal. Woke up after 9 hours or so and felt good. Had the morning fog butI was happy with my sleep. Went the entire day w/o feeling like I needed a nap. I got so much done. The depression and anger that followed me around felt lifted. It was pretty cool.  I began using the machine nightly and if I took a nap I'd wear it.  \n\n\nLate last summer I joined a gym and changed my diet.  During that time I went on a trip and couldn't take my machine with me.  I slept pretty good, wasn't needing naps. The so commented on how I was no longer snoring, so I sort of stopped using the machine. No issues, I'd wake up feeling ok.  \n\n\nA few. months ago the sleep issues hit again. I was at work one morning and needed a nap around 930am despite having slept 8 hours. The day prior I was busy - 2 crossfit workouts then a long hike. No stimulants after my 6am coffee. Tried the machine, couldn't get used to it. Started up on it in early June, positive changes happened within a few days. Went out of country and didn't take it, felt ok but once home, boom.  I wore it last night after reading this article and will be wearing it from here on out.",
