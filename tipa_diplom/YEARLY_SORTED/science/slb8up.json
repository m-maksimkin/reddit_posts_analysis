There is a VERY simple, and I would think obvious reason for this.\n\n**We already survived a whole-ass plague.** I personally did not survive with AIDS for > 35 years just to be killed by COVID. Just sayin\n\nAnd not that long ago. We (teh gayz of a certain age)  lived through a time when there was a LOT more death than I think people may realize. Of all the people in my extended social circle in 1991 (when I was 21) which was a little over 100 people.  Only 3 of us are still alive.\n\nCheck out the the AIDS Memorial on Instagram. #whatIsRememberedLives\n\nThe obituary section of San Francisco's local gay paper, The Bay Area Reporter (BAR) had grown so out of control each week that they had to limit them to 200 per week.  First come, first served.  There would be LINES of people at 6am in front of the BAR offices because to get your loved one in the obituaries, you were literally in competition with all the other grieving people.  And you only got one shot. The person had to have died that week to even qualify.  So if you didn't make the cut one week, you could not try again and your loved one's death happened silently and that was that.\n\nSafe-Sex was insisted upon and even enforced (like seriously) in sex clubs and bath-houses. Condoms (like masks) were the way out in absence of a vaccine or any \"cure\"  There were people who still barebacked, but not to be a rebel, It was usually two guys choosing to bareback BECAUSE both people are positive. (re-infection with multiple strains was found to not be a thing)\n\nAnyway, It was a level of responsibility that the gay community took on with some considerable gusto. There WERE AIDS deniers. One such group even hijacked ACT-UP SF and turned it into a conspiracy disinformation center that tried to convince people that AIDS was not caused by HIV and that the medicines were made to kill gay people. Sound familiar?  ie: we weren't dying from AIDS, we were dying from the meds we were taking FOR AIDS.  Both \"founders\" of that group, who refused treatment are dead... from AIDS.\n\nThese are some of the reasons why the LGBTQ community has somewhere north of 90% vaccination rate.  There are many many more.\n\nHow I know: At 19 years old, I was a co-founder of the first non-profit (501-c3) AIDS service organization in the world for youth under 24.  I'll try and answer anyone's questions.. anyways. Be safe. Masks work.",
