I'd much rather have a tiny/small house, some pets, more % equity in liquid investments, and not feel as tied to an excessive mortgage so that I can have more freedom to have experiences rather than have needless material \"wealth\".\n\nMy parents built wealth for themselves. They were also chronically stressed, always desperate to keep up with the Joneses, and so addicted to work that they decided that they needed to run not just 1 major business, but 2, such that they never really had any time or energy for their children, or time for themselves, despite their net worth. I have no desire to mimic that life. A solid job / career, sure, but I've achieved that without even having finished my degree, and fulfilling work is much more important than lucrative work imo. So there doesn't seem to be much barrier to a median income, other than patiently developing skills and maturity, and working through pain periods. With a reliable partner that's similar, that can enable a pretty abundant life if you plan it well and don't blow future financial security on escapist methods that are ironically often just ways of avoiding feeling the short term pain of financial insecurity.\n\nWe have such vastly increased ubiquitous luxuries these days that just didn't exist when I was their age, and I'm not going to pretend otherwise. Affordable EVs or hybrids that save significant money per mile, are reliable, and go 0-speed limit insanely quick? Incredibly powerful information technology, and the ability to call long distance without it costing $0.10/min? Literal technologically enabled telepathy? All the gaming, music, and TV content that anyone could dream of for hilariously low cost compared to renting from Blockbuster and buying albums? All the ability in the world to meet compatible partners and like minded friends online, when being a nerdy quiet kid in the past was basically social suicide? Life is short, taking this stuff for granted like we aren't, in many ways, living like absolute kings who refuse to wake up to the present is a bit glum and unappeasable. I even have legal weed where I live for comical prices.\n\nWe're getting fucked by inflation on the consumer price index / housing market front, but all that means is reigning in expectations some in certain areas, provided it doesn't go full Venezuela. Prices (relative to wages) on tons of high quality goods has actually *dropped* quit a bit over the years due to economies of scale and automation. Housing is one of the exceptions.\n\nI don't really feel the need for our country to be the clear #1 on economic mobility, and I really can't see how anything more than narcissism and entitlement would suggest that we should retain some top position with any sort of perpetuity. Plenty of other countries are severely industrious and it's really no surprise that they might be faring better in those sorts of metrics.",

In Poland, you cannot choose your public preschool, instead you apply with your top 3 schools, based on your income etc(lower the better), you get your top picks. And in schools, everyone studies at the same level. If there are people who don't want to learn calculus, too bad for them! It's really quite a huge contrast to the USA where it's all about where you live. Rich areas have better schools, poor areas have worse schools, and you go to the school closest to you. People pay good money in the USA to go to good schools, so the rich get richer, poor get poorer.\n\nHaving said that, my wife was a top student and ended up getting her phd. During her high school there were people who simply put... had no interest in calculus etc. They targeted her for doing so well. When I went to school in the USA, they separated us between the AP/honors kids and everyone else, but not here. As a result, society is more mixed in terms of classes. For better or worse. Like when i go to a public park or public swimming pool I've met some pretty angry people from bad areas but... they're not dangerous /desperate for say.. healthcare like the usa. The bad areas in the USA are 1000x worse. So overall, there is less crime, people get along well despite all the mixing, though.. they aren't very friendly in general. In the USA right now it's getting pretty bad/violent in public places from what my family is telling me, to the point where parks aren't fun because they don't want to fight angry parents / angry homeless etc. There's a lot of pent up class agression in the USA. And rightfully so, because if you're born poor it gets harder every year to not be poor as the rich get richer. My opinion is the pie isn't getting much bigger like it has in the past, so now chickens are coming home to roost.",

It worked that way in the US as well until around 1980 when the Republican Party implemented a program of phasing out the unionized workforce, cutting back on social benefits and reducing taxes on the wealthy.  This was essentially a massive transfer wealth from the 90% to the wealthy 10%.  Not only did the Republican Party flourish with this program but the Democratic Party, to a certain extent, fell in line with that program because they really could never gain any traction fighting it.\n\nThe big mystery is why so many lowered and middle income folks seem to have come to support a series of changes that diverts wealth from them and transfers it to the wealthy and why haven’t the wealthy in other developed countries been able to pull off the same thing.  The answer is very complex and very simple:  Race.  In the US, advocates for the Rich have been able to convince so many people to turn against the very system that has created their relative prosperity by arguing that that system is really their to benefit the Blacks, the Browns, the undeserving Others.",

I don’t think it’s wrong per se, but it seems odd that a real scientific paper says in its abstract: “the American Dream is slowly fading away.” What people think is the American Dream is pretty subjective. I think it would be better for the paper to just state “upward income mobility is less in America than in Germany.” It’s also odd that the author compared America to only one other country, Germany, specifically West Germany. Since Germany had been devastated by World War II and divided during the Cold War, it just seems cherry-picked to use Germany comparing to US. A better comparison would perhaps be to compare the US to other OECD nations or compare the US to its past.",

            "text": "Well people should be aware about this facts:\n\nWe in germany have:\n\nThe second highest energy costs in the whole world. Only japan is more expensive. \n\nOnly the Boomers are rich. I am a 34 year old mals working as a male nurse. My overall income after taxes is around 2100 €. With night shifts i would earn around 2300€. If i would work on an intensive care unit again it would be maybe around 2800€. BUT. The renting costs are getting more expensive. I can not move to another area or city, because otherwise i have to pay around 800€  till 1000€ per month for renting. Right now i am paying 500€. (I had a time where i was living poor compared to other germans so i could pay my car debt back. I lived 3 years basically on water and bred, just to pay back the car) \n\nA lot of people from my generation are lucky enough when they can pay their debt for their car. The boomer generation owned so much money, they could pay the debt for a house and at least two cars. At the sime time ONE man earned so much, he could provide for his wive and 9 kids. They could get vacation 2 times a year and FLY to other countries. \n\nIn todyas germany do not even think about providing for kids, fly to other countries or own a fancy car. \n\nThe politics in germany want to switch to electric cars. Yes. In a country where the ENERGY IS THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE WORLD. Good luck with owning a car at all then. \n\nThe politics are made for boomers who still think this system will run another hundred years. In germany we have not even the birth rate to replace oursselves. Most of the boomers are retiring soon.\n\nYou have to imagine. A german boomer familiy had roughly around 9 kids. Today a german family has 1 or none. And people still belive this system will work like always. \n\nAbout the german healthcare system. Do not be fooled as an american. It is falling appart. Most germans do not care or have absoluteley no clue what is rellay happening in the healthcare sphere. In my nursing class we had 30 people who started back in 2008. Out of this 30, 10 quit in the first year. Of the 20, 6 did not passed the exam. Out of the 14 only two are left who are still working in the healthcare system. Me and another one. And we are not even working on the \"direct\" frontline anymore. \n\nThe central local hospital here lost 6 experienced nurses at once, which were working on the intensive care unit, because of the work conditions. And of course because of Covid even more people are quitting theie job in the health industry. I had to work night shifts as one male nurse with 60!!!! 60!!! patients. Nobody wants wo work like that. \n\nWe have a rapidly aging population, with basically no birth rate and a healthcare system which is falling appart. \n\nFurthermore we have political diversity between ethnicities. Turkish germans, russian germans, polish germans, african refugees and so on. Aside from work this ethnicities do not interact much with each other. The major population of ethnic germans are the fast aging boomer population. What will happen after the boomers are gone? The population with the stongest birth rate are the muslim germans. It is a fact. So think about it before moving here. In 30 years you have to become a muslim on long term. It is bad? Not necessarily. But you have to accept the fact, that the christian population is dieing out. Especially when you are white think twice about moving here. We have a lot of germans now who have brown or dark skin now. And yes we have racism against white people too. You better avoid some areas in Cologne this day. Not even the police is patroling there anymore. If you are a black or brown person, you will adjust on the long term in germany in the next 30. If you are white, think about moving here. This is not racist. It is just a fact. A lot of the arabian and muslim communities will not accept it when you live in their neigbourhood and you are white. Most of them will not attack you or kill you. But you will live a very lonly life, because you are not part of their community. And they will show you this! \n\nBy the way germany is a very very expensive country. If you want to live debt free here, you are up for a challange. \n\nOur education system is getting more bad and bad. Before we had a system where teachers were paid by the state. Today a lot of teachers are paid extremly bad, because they are not paid by the state anymore. So a lot of capable people do not even want to become a teacher anymore. \n\nThe german car industry. A lot of the german wealth comes from the german car industry. Untill 2030 all german cars will not run on gasoline anymore. What is the meaning of this? A lot of unemployed people. A lot! So the german wealth will implode. \n\nCurrently germany is the engine which holds the EU together because we pay tons of money to the other EU states. Especially the eastern european states. What do you think will happen when germany can not pay for the rest of the EU? Yes it will fall appart. Especially the eastern european countries have way more conservative view an a lot of things compared to the western european countries. \n\nFinally the german army. It is a joke. No really. It is! Tanks are not driving, jets are not flying, attack helicopters are braking appart while flying. In germany you will be considered stupid or a failure when you join the german army.\n\nAh and the Internet. Super expensive and very bad. Especially in the rural areas.",
