Despite the name, \"microplastics\" is defined by NOAA to be any piece of plastic smaller than 5mm. There's definitely a lot of microplastics in the ocean, but I can't immediately find an answer for how much of it is less than 2 microns. I imagine that there can't be that much, at least by mass anyway. Plastics contain a fairly large amount of chemical energy. If there were that much free molecular energy floating around, you'd expect to see an organism evolve to consume it. More likely it seems to me is that by the time a piece of plastic has been worn down to only a couple molecules, UV radiation, other chemicals, or just further abrasion completely destroy the particle. This isn't a great alternative - now you have a bunch of free benzene floating around. But still worth thinking about.",

Moreover, microglia homeostasis seems to play an important role in the ongoing synapse formation in the brain; these specific functions as well as mechanisms are however far from understood.\n\nThough it looks like their death could play a part in synapse formation?
