That’s OK because I have a good to-do list app to make sure I get them all done. But that means that I don’t actually have to make a mental effort to remember them. I used to make list in my head (and then in a Filofax) and that was a constant back-of-the-mind list that was running in my short term memory. That just no longer exists. I feel like my entire short term memory has been outsourced to my phone. There was a certain little anxiety in making sure you remembered your daily list, but now it’s effortless. \n\nI think this may be the cause. We just don’t exercise our brain in remembering lists of things to do and other things that are short term.\n\nAdd that to the constant flow of junk knowledge that we acquire from places like Reddit and I am not surprised at all that our memory is terrible.",

Processed foods. Now more than ever Americans are consuming a horrible diet of processed foods and food like items…none of which lead to any sort of health or good outcome. \n\n2. Long work hours….mostly sitting and for many staring at a computer screen all day. Humans were simply not built for this kind of existence and as prices rise for everything from housing to food more people are forced to work well more than the required 40 hour work week. \n\n3. Health care tied to employment. Many that are in bad situations can simply not afford to make a change or adjust their life without taking a huge financial risk.  High cost deductibles also play a huge role in many Americans going without mental health drugs or a therapist simply because they don’t have to funds. \n\n4. Self medication and drinking. Don’t have the money for proper medical care? A lot of Americans aren’t alone and therefore can cope with working long hours and being depressed with weed/painkillers/alcohol. A therapist cost well over $100 a session……a 30 pack of beer is $20…..\n\n5. Debt……educational/credit cards/housing/medical……..doesn’t really matter too much the reason. A lot of Americans are just trying to survive and get by and an easy access to credit and debt can stop the bleeding momentarily. It’s not good and we know it but as there is no longer a debtors prison we do what we can just to survive. \n\n6. Which if course leads to prison populations which are another capitalist profiteering system…\n\n7. Add all of this up and most who have spent any significant time pondering their own future might come out of it with existential dread…..global warming, a pandemic, rising tensions across the globe. \n\nThe most surprising thing to me is simply the fact that humans have the ability to cope and adjust as well as we have.",
