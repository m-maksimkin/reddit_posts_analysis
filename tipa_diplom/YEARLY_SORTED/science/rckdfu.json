There are also unconsidered variables such as the concentration of nicotine absorbed on average between the two.\n\nThis, of course, makes perfect sense since nicotine acts as a vasoconstrictor which shuts off or partially closes blood vessels. Already known. This is what causes the ‘nicotine rush,’ numbness in the fingertips and cheeks, when you have one or two but otherwise aren’t addicted or smoke regularly.\n\nThe study can’t conclude whether ED as a result of absorbing nicotine also carries any permanence, and isn’t a condition that will improve or cure itself entirely over time if and when a man quits.",
