    "CMV: The problem isn't that Lizard People are running various world governments. The problem is that they're not doing a good enough job.\nI've become aware of a fascinating conspiracy theory that Lizard People run various governments--the United States of America, etc. \n\nAlways, the operating assumption is that this is bad specifically because they are Lizard People. I find this close minded and offensive. We shouldn't be biased against Lizard People per se anymore than we should be biased against people based on skin color or gender: it's their biology, and not fair to hold against them. \n\nHowever, if Lizard People really are running, say, the United States (my country, which will be my focus because I have the most insight into it) government, a very fair objection is that they're simply not very competent. \n\nI'd rather not focus on my specific views on what exactly the government is doing wrong (that would be a different CMV)--in this polarized age, one thing both ends of the political spectrum happen to agree on is that the government isn't functioning at a high level. So I won't dive into that here.\n\nI foresee some objections:\n\n(1) It's bad that the Lizard People are leading the government because they aren't citizens and so have no right to lead. My counter: in conspiracy theories I've seen, no one denies the Lizard People live among us, in which case they should, by birth right, have citizenship. If they've been denied proper citizenship due to specie-ism, I'm not going to hold that against them as it is inherently unjust.\n\n(2) The Lizard People are only doing a bad job for humans because they hate humans and only want what's best for lizards, which shows they should never be in positions of authority.  My counter: if this were true, we should see some evidence that they're implementing pro-lizard policies. In fact, we see just the opposite. The United States, for instance, has not done nearly enough to combat climate change, which scientist point out is especially hard on lizards ([https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/05/492713407/for-lizards-climate-change-is-a-deadly-and-complex-threat](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/05/492713407/for-lizards-climate-change-is-a-deadly-and-complex-threat))\n\n(3) Lizard People are subhuman and gross and we should hate them. Warm blood good, cold blood bad! My counter: come on. Aren't we better than that? These are not morally or ethically defensible positions.\n\nAs an alternate approach to hating Lizard People because they're reptilian, I would argue for a more objective, even handed, less specie-ist/racist approach: we should hold the Lizard People accountable for poor governance.  The polarization of politics, lack of progress on poverty, unjust taxation schemes, poorly organized pandemic response, increasing budget deficits with seemingly no real strategy or goal, comparably worse health care than other countries, and impotence in the face of the global catastrophe of climate change all point to poor policy decisions on the part of the Lizard People. Working together, we can build a better future. One in which humanoids are judged not based on their body temperature, presence of scales, and ability to lay eggs, but on the content of their character and ability to competently govern and participate in the civic process.": [

Theoretically, exposure to say a snowy day would force them to a standstill, unable to function level, where they usually enter brumation.\n\nFurthermore, I've never understood why a lizard person is considered so distinctly evil compared to mammalian people? Evolution would suggest that a lizard person would have originally been from the family Hominidae and diverged, being some form of subspecies of homo sapiens or great apes. Having scales and being ectothermic wouldn't mean their brain is compositionally different. Of course you could suggest lizards developed into lizard humans, but technically in evolution, that's already what happened with all mammalians, as all mammals evolved from the reptilian synapsids.\n\nWe could also agree that lizard people aren't actually lizard people, but people with scales that look lizards.

They were able to disguise themselves as humans and establish earthly empires. The Sumerian empire is widely considered the foundational example of this, later the Aztecs and Inca, Egyptians and so on.\n\nThe fundamental concept is that **the Annunaki are enslaving humanity to extract both energy and resources.** This takes the form of both material extraction which (I’m a little shaky on this) according the story they extracted some rare earth materials long ago and brought them back to their planet. But they are also harvesting human psychic energy. Which is to say, they feed off of negative human emotions such as fear, hatred, anger etc. they perpetuate theses emotions by maintaining systems of control that withholds resources and money from the majority, and stoke division amongst the people so that their anger is directed at each other rather than the masters.\n\n So, **the reason we should oppose the lizard people, is not because they are *lizards* but because they maintain their power in our societies in order to exacerbate and extract these negative emotions that stands in the way of humanity achieving peace and harmony**.",

One of the key tenets of neoliberalism, the economic consensus between Democrats and Republicans, is the deregulation of corporations.\n\nIn Das Kapital, Karl Marx's seminal work critiquing capitalism, he outlines two types of value that neoclassical economics didn't try to differentiate between: use-value and exchange-value. Exchange-value was synonymous with how the word price was used, but Marx tried to establish a methodology for deriving the value of goods based on labor being put into creating a commodity. The gap between these two is what creates the feeling of getting a \"good deal\" or a \"bad deal\" when buying things.\n\nThe lizards want to maximize their profits, so their goal is to produce based on exchange-value, make they can earn selling goods, not what goods are needed to be used. You won't convince a capitalist to reduce their profits by using the government to collectively reduce costs because it would undercut their own interests in maximizing their private profit.\n\ntl;dr They are doing a good job.

I think the reason you are saying that they're not doing a good enough job is that you see the government as more incompetent than evil. But the problem is that it's very hard to distinguish between the two.\nConsider medieval nobility. What they cared about is staying in power and becoming more powerful. That's very much not align with what most people want, and you could consider them evil. If lizard people do exist, they are in all likelihood similar to that. They have different motives than you and want to stay in power. But if you look at the functioning of governments run by these nobles, they are very incompetent. Even more than modern governments. They could barely get a functioning tax system running or a standing army. The whole deal about feudalism is that kings were too incompetent to handle ruling a state and needed other nobles to do most of the work for them. But these are two sides of the same coin. If you only care about staying in power, you wouldn't want to be \"competent\" from an average person perspective. If they would have tried to centralize power too much, they would get overthrown in a rebellion. Likewise, technological progress was a threat to nobility, so they tried to stop it. Lizards people would likely be the same. They wouldn't care about, say, giving efficient universal healthcare, because that simply doesn't concern them.

If the US president is literally a Chinese/Russian puppet, elected thanks to foreign psi-ops and propaganda you'd probably find the election similarly illegitimate, if these circumstances were to come to light.\n\nEnough about the simple fact that their government is fundamentally illegitimate.\nOn to their agenda- 2 explanations for the lizard people present themselves: first, the lizard-people evolved on earth- this makes typical lizards related to these lizard-people about as apes are related to humans.\nAnd humans can end up caring more for the possible extinction of some great cat than for some random primate species. There is no reason to think that the conservation of ancestral pre-sapient lizards is an objective for these lizard; secondly, the lizard-people are often imagined to be aliens, only superficially resembling terrestrial lizards. In this case they have even less reason to care for the lizards that somewhat resemble them.\n\nSo whatever \"pro-lizard\" policy they implement would not necessarily present itself as such- they might be an advance unit, softening up human resistance to their oncoming invasion, or perhaps want to steal the earth, and is implementing a long form genocide, possibly by causing the creation, and spread of nasty diseases, or by casually frustrating efforts to prevent antrhopogenic climate change (flying to the G7 meeting in a polluting airliner instead of just doing a Zoom call)\n\nThe issue is that, their agenda being unknown it can be as benign or as nefarious as you could imagine- what is clear however is that they are almost certainly not trying to repressent the citizenry, which is what their job really is.\n\nI could probably see myself voting for an out lizard-person candidate (if the candidate is not \"out\" then them being a lizard has no bearing on my potential vote) given an agreeable campaign platform and sufficient reasosn to trust them.\n\nBut forgive me if I do not trust someone who needs to pretend to be something as fundamental to our societies as being human.",

They might be voting selfishly and/or incompetently from non-Lizard people point of view, but if you're willing to give them that right, you cannot hold it against them or their representatives if they don't use that right \"well enough\" from your point of view.",

That’s why she won’t let it have chocolate. But, there’s no way for her to explain this to the dog, alas.\n\nI wonder how often we’re the doggo, demanding danger muffins, then sulking and resenting those who denied us.\n\nIF we are being lead by a group of highly intellectual extra terrestrial lizard beings, *they just might know things that we don’t*, and what they’re doing may seem awful to us, but only bc there’s no way to explain why it actually makes perfect sense- like not giving chocolate to dogs.",

Aren't they usually conservatives who talk about lizard people, and isn't the Christian faith a common thread among many of them? I always thought this was obvious. \n\nOne of the themes in Revelation is Babylon personified as a woman of shall we say \"ill repute.\" We used to have, for example Lauryn Hill, calling out the ills of babylon and wanting to see it fall, but now, not so much. I think maybe it's more symbolic than anything else, like a placeholder or scape goat for all the evils of humanity being poured out by an army of demonic overlords. So with that view, that I would think these conspiracy theorists are really trying to convey, there's no way they would have our best interests at heart. \n\nI get most people aren't going to believe this, not expecting you to, just thought it was obvious that the conspiracy theorists believed this sort of thing.",
