Educators should be intelligent not fanatics who are driven by politics and pseudo science, we don't need them indoctrinating upcoming generations with their nonsense.\n\nEmergency services, We don't need police who support these conspiracy nuts or the politically motivated keeping a pandemic alive. Fire Fighters are life savers and we should make sure they are all of sound mind so we can trust them because last thing we need are fire departments having these fools in their ranks, EMTs same as the first point.\n\nAll other government jobs, we don't need anti science individuals making policy if you are paid by the tax dollar you need to be someone who listens to facts and who isn't making decisions based on conspiracies' or political clownery.\n\nThe vaccine is now approved fully time to lay down the law and rid the public sector of these people so we can get climb out of this abyss we have fallen into.": [

Stop the spread etc. \n\nWell as part of my original scepticism about the vaccine which seems to be proven more and more, especially with the Delta variant - the vaccine is not that good at stopping the spread. So the \"protect others\" doesn't really hold out if I can still spread it just as easily regardless of if I'm vaccinated. So , at the moment, the vaccine doesn't seem to benefit the wider public so my decision to not have it doesn't seem to greatly impact anybody but myself.\n\nYou can't just blindly follow all science. The vaccine was originally sold to us as being about 90% effective at stopping infection and reducing the spread of the virus. Those numbers are getting down graded more and more each month.",

            "text": "This entire thread is terrifying.  It's almost as if most humans nowadays have lost the ability to think critically for themselves, or perhaps they just lost the compassion for one another.  \n\n\nI've been called lots of names in my life.  Though I never thought I'd see the day where someone would be able to label me an anti-vaxxing conspiracy nut job, but here we are...  \n\n\nI won't try and argue with the entire thread.  I'm sure the downvotes will be enough.  Let me just give my side of why I'm going to avoid this shot as long as possible.  The rest of you can decide on how crazy I am at that point.  \n\n\nYou already have the perfect case study.  Isreal.  In Isreal, there are about 180 cases of serious life-threatening covid cases per 100,000 people age 60 and over that are unvaccinated.  (180/100000).  To compare that same group of vaccinated people only 20 out of 100000 vaccinated get life-threatening cases. (20/100000).  So there is some truth to the 'vaccine' helping prevent some serious cases.  Written another way, a fully vaccinated person currently has a 1 in 5000 chance of dying from COVID19.  \n\n\nLet me list off some other common ways of dying, these are per 100,000 people:  \nHeart disease: 200.8\r  \nMalignant neoplasms (tumors): 182.7\r  \nAccidents (unintentional injuries): 52.7\r  \nChronic lower respiratory diseases:\t47.8\r  \nCerebrovascular diseases (stroke): 45.7\r  \nAlzheimer's disease: 37\r  \nDiabetes: 26.7\r  \nKidney disease: 15.7\r  \nInfluenza and pneumonia: 15.2\r  \nIntentional self-harm (suicide):\t14.5\r  \n\t\n\n1-year odds per 100000 people:\r  \nAccidental poisoning by and exposure to noxious substances:\t19\r  \nDrug poisoning:\t18\r  \nOpioids (including both legal and illegal):\t12.995\r  \nAll motor vehicle accidents:\t12.04\r  \nAssault by firearm:\t4.26\r  \nI totally get why we would want to rid the planet of something almost as deadly as McDonald's, but why is the government; nay, pretty much the entire world so worked up to the point of collapsing the economy of the entire planet over it?    \n\n\nWhat's with the raffles, and lotteries, the incentives?    \n\n\n\"BUT EXCELSIOR YOU DIMWIT ITS NOT LIEK THAY DINT MANDATE THEM THERE SMALLPOXXES VACCNINATIONNNNS\"  \n\n\n Smallpox was killing 1 in every 3 people that got infected.  It was it's own incentive.   Still, its a good example of why I'm hesitant.  Smallpox vaccine is so effective, that it's ERADICATED Smallpox.  The last case in the U.S. being 1949.  Back to Isreal, Isreal has about 60% of it's total population vaccinated.  The most recent number I can find shows 58% of people.  Yet Isreal is also seeing that 60% of the COVID19 patients in hospitals are vaccinated within the last 5 months.  \n\n\nLogically you could then argue that the vaccine has increased my odds of surviving ninefold.  Which sounds AMAZING.  Right up until you realize that 100000 / 180 (0.0018%) means that 1 in 555.55 people that get covid get seriously ill if unvaccinated.  While only 100000 / 20  (.0002%) people get seriously ill while vaccinated.  Except they now spread the virus also.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen you get the adverse reactions website which as of today show 41,457 cases of adverse reactions. (I filtered the number to only include death, life-threatening, and permanent disability) These numbers are a little misleading.  There is some debate on what % of cases are even reported, but I will agree that a major side effect is more likely to be reported than a rash or something less problematic.  I've seen it claimed that only 1% of cases make it on that website. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n The CDC themselves said  \"...spokesperson for the CDC told Reuters by email that reporting rates for adverse events vary. She said: “Mild events, like a rash, tend to be reported less frequently than severe events (like a seizure). We have data to show that serious adverse events that occur after vaccination are more likely to be reported than non-serious adverse events. Events such as a sore arm at the injection site might not get reported since they are expected and therefore people don’t feel the need to report them...\"  That sounds correct to me.  \n\n\nStudies have found reporting rates on VAERS of 47% for cases of intussusception cases after the rotavirus vaccine and 68% for paralytic polio after the oral polio vaccine, while rates ranged from 13 to 76% for anaphylaxis   \nhttps://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33039207/\n\nSo all I can say with any confidence is that somewhere between 41,457 and 4,145,700 (but more likely 41,457 to about 60,000) have had some extreme complications just after a dose of the vaccine.   \n\n\nSo here in the US that number is 18963.  According to the tracker in the US 364 million doses have been administered.  That means you have a 1 in 19,195 chance (5.20/100000) (BEST CASE SCENARIO) of getting life-threatening complications, permanent disability, or death, shortly after the vaccine.   \n\n\nYou are just as likely to die shortly after getting this vaccine than you are of getting killed by a gun in this country.  Whether the vaccine contributed or not is debatable I get that, but so is the other view.  Since the long-term studies haven't even had a chance to get completed yet, it's all heresay.\n\nPlease tell me how .0018% comes anywhere near collapsing the world economy, when not even the Spanish Flu that killed between 20-50 million people did that.  \"The Spanish flu left almost no discernible mark on the aggregate US economy\" - Google.  Yet Covid19 shows up and absolutely DECIMATES the world markets.    \n\n\nBiden mailing off free money to everyone means massive inflation.  Besides, where is all the money coming from?\n\nMom and pop landlords are going extinct.  Being forced into selling to large multi-property companies.    \n\n\nRestaurants are going extinct.  \n\n\nMovie Theaters?    \n\n\nThe truth is that pretty much anything that relies on brick-and-mortar business fronts is going bye-bye.  Except the ones large enough to survive, and even those are feeling the pinch.    \n\n\nIt's only getting worse as they force the same small businesses to keep enforcing practices that mean less and less customers.  \n\n\nTo end.  I never claimed to be a math wizard so if anyone wants to critique etc please do.  I am open to discussion because quite honestly I'd love for someone to help change my mind and put my fears to rest.    \n\n\nI know not everyone will agree with me, but I hope no matter which way you all lean, that you make it through all of this happy and healthy.  I wouldn't ever want to wish harm upon anyone, even if they don't like my point of view!",

            "text": "There's 3 reasons I disagree and you can tell me whether you think these could be valid reasons or perhaps why you disgree with these reasons.\n\n1. **As new variants are discovered, each vaccine has a different effectiveness % against those variants.  People risk getting a vaccine too early with a low effectiveness against future variants with higher mortality rates.  People who are willing to accept the risk should exercise delayed gratification for research to find out which vaccine providers are most efective against specific variants of concern.**\n   1. For example, I worry about the Lambda variant which seems to have caused a 9-10% mortality rate in Peru.  It could be because of poor medical infrastructure in the country that the mortality rate is so high, but there's also the chance it will begin spreading in the US and have a much higher mortality rate than the alpha variant or even the delta variant.\n   2. IF this new variant (or other new variants we could see in the future) have a much higher mortality rate, the problem is each and every vaccine provider has a totally different effectiveness against different variants.\n   3. By forcing people to get the vaccine early (especially young people who otherwise have healthy immune systems), they're really GAMBLING on which vaccine is going to protect them from a variant with a higher mortality rate.\n   4. If people are happy to assume the risk of the variants spreading right now, and want to wait until there's a more deadly variant and research as to which vaccine provider is most effective against it, I think people should have that option.\n   5. The situation, from my pov, that I want to avoid is taking a random vaccine now (let's say it's Pfizer), then Lambda or another variant begins spreading in the US with, let's say a 10% mortality rate for argument's sake, and research comes out saying Pfizer only has a 38% effectiveness.  There's another vaccine out there from another company with 90% effectiveness that I could've got, but I was pushed into getting the vaccine too early.  Then I have to decide between taking a medical risk of getting multiple vaccines from multiple companies in a short period of time, or decide to accept the risk of 38% effectiveness against a variant killing 1 in 10 people.  (\\*THESE STATS ARE MADE UP FROM VAGUE MEMORY, SO THEY ARE UNTRUE, IMAGINED FOR THE SAKE OF DEBATE\\*)\n2. **Some countries require vaccination from specific providers to visit or work in those countries.  Requiring these people to get an available vaccine can reduce their work opportunities and separate them from their families for longer.**\n   1. Many people are stuck in situations where they can't leave the current country they're in to visit family or even spouses.  Forcing these people to get a vaccine available in their current country which is unsupported in their destination country could force them to a) experiment with getting multiple vaccines from multiple vaccine providers, which could be dangerous (we don't know yet), b) force them to be stuck in this country for even longer even though all they've been trying to do is go to their destination country.  This could effectively separate spouses and families for years.\n   2. A potential solution I think should be to allow people to choose which vaccine they want.  For example, I live in the US, but I would have higher confidence and more work opportunities if I got China's vaccine.  Unofrtunatley, this is not an option for me right now, so I am postponing getting any available vaccine in the US.\n3. **There's currently a study being conducted to see if the vaccine actually reduces the spread of the virus.  We don't know...  They know it reduces the probability of serious symptoms, death, etc, but they don't know yet if it reduces (at all) the spreadability from a vaccinated person to anyone else.**\n   1. IF (because it's not proven yet) the vaccine doesn't reduce spread, that means we have higher spreadability because people with the vaccine don't realize they're spreading it.  They'll have higher confidence to go out, and therefore more people will get the virus.\n   2. IF the vaccine doesn't reduce spread, it doesn't help your neighbors.  It could be considered a relatively \"selfish\" choice to protect yourself and increase potential harm to others.\n   3. IF the vaccine doesn't reduce spread, all the \"selfless\" reasons people were told to get the vaccine go out the window.\n   4. The problem is we don't know yet.  We will find out soon after the study concludes.",

[This one in particular](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/pba7o1/cmv_all_healthcare_employees_and_public_sector/habb9z0/) is the best case I've seen for mandates for healthcare workers. I recommend it to anyone who agrees with my points below! I still disagree with the OP in the main, but have a bit of thinking to do WRT healthcare workers. Probably won't post any more in this thread. Do get your vaccines, everyone! Unedited response follows.\\] \n\nDisagree. But first let me say that I'm double-vaccinated, and recommend the jab to anyone who's unsure.\n\nFirst, on principle, I think it's unethical and anti-worker to deprive people of a living on the basis of their opinion about a vaccine. Not much of an argument there, but let's get it out of the way and move to some practical points ...\n\nSecond, not all unvaccinated people are \"conspiracy nuts\". There are lots of reasons why someone might not want the vaccine. Maybe they generally trust medical science but are worried about possible side effects. Maybe they're low risk for Covid (say, young and healthy), and so are willing to risk that to guarantee no side effects. I would personally disagree with their assessment of risk, but it isn't completely insane or a conspiracy theory.\n\nThird, if we think \"conspiracy nuts\" are a problem, sacking people *en masse* because of vaccine scepticism is not going to solve that problem. It will feed it, and quite possibly push *more* people to conspiracy theories. Even if we think it's ethical, it's potentially counter-productive. Same for police officers and the rest. You'd be creating a mass of unemployed, resentful people. Their families would suffer too. I pretty much guarantee that lunatics like Alex Jones would increase their following if we did this.\n\nFourth, sacking health workers during a pandemic (or any time) risks an obvious problem of worker shortages. Many healthcare systems are already stretched. Patients will suffer more and in some cases die if there aren't enough people to care for them.\n\nFifth, in most parts of the world where mass vaccine rollout is possible, the vast majority of people are not anti-vaxx. Rollout has been hugely successful in many countries (including the US) precisely because of this. And it's working. I simply don't think the problem is great enough to justify the scale of the moral panic it's generated. (Imagine if we put the same energy into producing more vaccines for parts of the world where they're not widely available.)\n\nSixth, and finally, I don't think coercion or insults are the best way to persuade people to take the vaccine. Even the ones who are into conspiracy theories aren't necessarily irredeemable, brainwashed fools. They're human beings who've lost faith in authority and official institutions (with justification IMO, even if I don't agree with where they've landed). If we simply treat people like idiots, we can't expect them to come around to an alternative point of view.",

That doesn't mean being a conspiracy nut-job, but it means being somewhat patient and analyzing the data, weighing pros and cons and wrestling with what you want to do. Science isn't perfect. I know that anti-science idiots like to say that, but I mean that in the most historical, liberal way possible. Everyone is fallible and every system is made and maintained by humans, so lord knows you should do as much research as you can and make what you think is a good choice.\n\nData is always changing. More of it is always coming in and we're refining it all the time. Even now, I'm nervous about the Delta variant because I haven't found great evidence that I am not more at risk of getting very sick from it than the other strains, especially six months after vaccination. Am I now being \"anti-science\" because I'm being what some might think is OVERLY conservative? Or because I'm worried that people/the government might be underselling the risk to me because they want people to \"just get the vaccine\" because of this PR nightmare? Like I said, the government is just as chaotic as every other institution and they're trying to do the right thing or what serves them and the people, etc.\n\nThis is the same way I'd treat any doctor, or nurse. They're all just people and like any other field in life, there's differences of opinions, clashes, improvements, etc. I'm morbidly obese (working on it), so I know I'm higher at risk. Is that being talked about too much? Not really and I think a lot of that is branding reasons: They don't want a huge portion of this country to feel hopeless and desperate, and they want us to feel that if we get the vaccine we're fully good. And I'm not sure if that's true or will be true for all variants. I pull(ed) the data I can find, took the vaccine since it will definitely help, all while trying to do other things to mitigate risk.\n\nEven when the booster comes. Am I wrong for wanting to wait a month or two to see how people react to it? Am I anti-science if I want to analyze the studies of how different companies go about seeing risk factors, etc.? Because I would think any philosopher of science would tell you that can be a healthy way of looking at things.\n\nEven now you say the vaccine is fully approved, where I think any healthily skeptical person would judge how drugs are approved and the various tensions there are within that system. For instance, I knew that the approval was contingent on some precautionary measures I didn't think were as important as others, so now that it's approved I don't feel any better about it. Is that anti-science?\n\nAnd this is the problem with these debates. Legit no one is talking to each other. Even when I hear someone being anti-vaccine, I sit them down and first ask them if we can establish various things like what the vaccine is, when we should trust a scientific study, things that we take for granted in every day life, when do they put their faith in medical institutions without proper knowledge, etc. It should be like any other debate. But even in your post, you're getting a bunch of us in the comments that got the vaccine and are super glad we did thinking you're coming off as drastic, hostile to the other side, and dismissive. So how would that come off as anything but simplistic and brash, just like you're accusing the other side of being (to be fair some of them on that side are simplistic and brash in their arguments)?\n\nOne thing I may agree with you on though, is about medical personnel. When I hear that a doctor or a nurse is anti-vaccine across the board it strikes me as incompatible with the job. It would be like me working for Starbucks and thinking all coffee is evil,. Isn't vaccines such a necessary bedrock of the modern medical worldview as to be a necessary prerequisite to get in? I'd say the same about a number of foundational medical practices.\n\nEDIT: Edited for grammar and word mistakes.",

Also ignored is new objective data that emerges. When CDC announced that vaccinated and unvaccinated aquire and transmit the virus at similar rates, did the \"selfish\" narrative change? NOPE. As it stands, if you are vulnerable and get the vaccine, you may avoid severe symptoms or death. That's a very strong argument for getting vaccinated, but that should be a choice. It'd be a good idea for those you are in significant danger. Not not everyone is.

It is simply not feasible to add stipulations and requirements to that.\n\nBut let's look at what vaccine hesitancy is. Is it denial of science?\n\nNo, it isnt. True, almost everyone that refuses the vaccine is too ignorant of the science to accurately determine the safety, reliability, and effectiveness of any one vaccine. That is also true, however, of almost everyone who *did* get the vaccine (myself included).\n\nSo what is it? Quite simply, it represents a lack of trust in the authorities that release the information, and the medical experts hired to research, produce, and advocate vaccination.\n\nDo I feel it unwise to ignore those things? Yes, after all, I vaccinated. Do I feel that the risk is justified? Well yes, I believe that too.\n\nBut do I feel that the reason is science denial? No, because laypeople can't make an informed decision on the science. The knowledge required to determine if an answer is correct is the same knowledge required to get a correct answer.\n\nExpert advice is invaluable, but it is not always to be trusted. Car salesmen and mechanics are experts at what they do. Should you trust everything such people tell you? Certainly not. For an expert to be reliably trusted, their interests must be aligned with yours. Many things can impact that. \n\nMoney, for example. Andrew Wakefield, when he first started the antivaxx conspiracies, had financial motivations that corrupted his reliability. He had a competing patent for a vaccine that competed with the MMR vaccine he made claims about. He was being paid to produce evidence discrediting the MMR vaccine. And journalists ate it up, just as they still often do today on new studies, before peer review.\n\nAlso, regulation can impact alignment of interests. Intimidation can. There are a lot of factors that impact reliability.\n\nSo the means to increase vaccination can't focus on science which 99% or more of the world can't validate. It needs to focus on restoring public trust in science by ethically reporting only on robust, peer reviewed science. By acknowledging fears and concerns, and speaking to the hesitant as people, not as \"nutjobs\" \"wackos\" or \"unhinged conspiracy theorists\". After all, how often have you been moved to seriously consider the view of a complete stranger who leads with \"you're an idiot\"? I haven't. I have listened to a very close friend who lead with that, but there was a basis of trust.\n\nIn short, the advocacy you are suggesting won't address the problem. The solution that works is the harder one, the one that takes more time than bullying people into compliance. It involves changing how we discuss science. How we report on it. How we address those who aren't sure of it.\n\nBecause reason doesn't change people's minds, in most cases. Empathy, respect, and trust do.",

I do find it odd that the unvaccinated are blamed when it has been proven vaccinated people can transmit covid and get covid. 75% of the people infected in the Provincetown outbreak in July were double vaccinated. 125k breakthrough cases in Massachusetts, this proves the vaccine doesn't stop covid or stop the spread of it. We are all going to get it, vaccinated or not. The vaccinated may not get as sick or show symptoms but that doesn't make us better than someone else. Someone may have allergies to something in the vaccine or they could have already had covid and have natural antibodies. Saying someone doesn't deserve care or should be purged from society just because they won't get a vaccine is ridiculous especially when the vaccine doesn't stop the spread of covid.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/article/science-health-coronavirus-pandemic-d9504519a8ae081f785ca012b5ef84d1\nWith this information one might come to the conclusion that vaccinated people could actually spread it more than a unvaccinated person. \n\nTake a vaccinated person with covid like symptoms, they might believe they are fine it's just a cold or allergies, I am vaccinated.  They will go about their daily lives, stopping by the bank, grocery store, or anywhere else spreading covid. \n\nNow take an unvaccinated person who has covid like symptoms they will get tested and stay home. \n\nSo once again is it the fault of the unvaccinated or vaccinated. I know I will not act like I am better than anyone else just because I am vaccinated and nobody else should.",

But only [half of nurses were vaccinated in June and the number was even lower for patient care techs (I believe about 25%).](https://www.forbes.com/sites/judystone/2021/06/28/covid19-vaccination-rates-are-poor-among-healthcare-workershow-can-we-do-better/) As of a week ago, about [27% of healthcare staff](https://news.northeastern.edu/2021/08/18/many-healthcare-workers-still-havent-gotten-covid-19-vaccines/) is unvaccinated. \n\nTo explain this, I'll throw out three politically incorrect views here. I'm going to use doctors, nurses, and patient care techs (who often work in nursing homes) as the stand in professions for this argument, but there are many different positions/hierarchies in medicine.\n\n1. Doctors, nurses, patient care techs, etc. are highly selfless/caring professionals. But there is a huge educational difference between these groups. Doctors have to earn the highest grades of any field and train for at least 12 years at elite institutions after high school. Nurses need college degrees, but the colleges aren't particularly selective. Patient care techs (and similar positions) don't need to go to college. So there is a huge educational gap here, which helps explain the gap in vaccine understanding/acceptance. More than race, religion, political views, wealth, etc. educational status is the best predictor of vaccination rates. MDs and PhDs in any field are more likely to be vaccinated than college graduates, who are more likely to be vaccinated than high school graduates, etc.\n\n2. All healthcare workers including doctors nurses, patient care techs, and pretty much all other positions are very scarce right now. There is a big labor shortage in all fields, and there is enormous demand for healthcare services right now due to the pandemic. Pretty much every hospital in the country is completely full right now. So hospitals can't afford to fire anyone. If they allow unvaccinated nurses or techs to see patients, then some people will die. But if they fire those techs/nurses, more people will die. It's not even a question of paying people more. There simply aren't enough people trained to do these jobs at the moment. There are better paying jobs in other fields that don't require getting a homeless person's poop on your hand. And this is a common occurrence for the tech, the nurse, and even the MD.\n\n3. All the medical decisions in clinics and hospitals are made by ultra well educated physicians who know enough basic science to fully commit to vaccination. If a doctor refuses to be vaccinated without a rare, but compelling reason, they should be fired. But nurses just have to collect health related data and give it to doctors. Patient care techs just have to bring people food and give them sponge baths. Many experienced nurses know quite a few things about clinical medicine themselves, and techs similarly pick up many things on the job. But even if they understand medicine so little that they refuse to be vaccinated, the physicians are still making all the calls. It's like how the general of the army needs to understand everything about military strategy, but a random grunt on the ground can do his or her job well as a high school drop out who only understands that they need to march. Again, this isn't to say that the grunt is dumb, but circumstances are more forgiving if they are compared to the military leadership.",

Half-assed proposals to have them fired for not being vaccinated will marginalize most of our minority population.  The Medical professionals also are not getting vaccinated.  Fire them?   That is, frankly, nuts.\n\nThere are plenty of scientific studies that show that masks do not work effectively and that the unapproved vaccines are far from perfect and could actually harm or kill you.   People have to weigh this information themselves and decide what they want to do.  What is really a lot more stupid is to let some assholes bully you into potentially risking your life because they believe someone in a lab coat on TV has all the answers.\n\nI have been vaccinated and my spouse has been too.  She will not get a booster because she had a horrible reaction to the shots.  She actually feels lucky to be alive.  Was in terrible pain for days.  Yet you want to bully her into getting another shot.  To hell with her health right?\n\nWhat nonsense do you want our teachers to indoctrinate our children with?   Your nonsense?   How about teaching children mathematics, science, literature, composition, and other things that will help them to become productive members of our society?  Right now in our school system they must be teaching the kids your nonsense because 80% of the minorities cannot pass standardized tests that have been repeatedly dumbed down to satisfy people illogically screaming racism.  Black parents should be in the streets rioting about being forced to send their children to terrible government schools run by union thugs who do not care about children whatsoever.",
