    "CMV: White people with dreadlocks is not cultural appropriation\nI’m sure this is going to trigger some people but let me explain why I hold this view.\n\nFirstly, I am fairly certain that white people in Ancient Greece, the Celts, Vikings etc would often adopt the dreadlock style, as they wore their hair ‘like snakes’ so to speak. Depending on the individual in questions hair type, if they do not wash or brush their hair for a prolonged period of time then it will likely go into some form of dreads regardless.\n\nMaybe the individual just likes that particular hairstyle, if anything they are actually showing love and appreciation towards the culture who invented this style of hair by adopting it themselves.\n\nI’d argue that if white people with dreads is cultural appropriation, you could say that a man with long hair is a form of gender appropriation. \n\nAt the end of the day, why does anyone care what hairstyle another person has? It doesn’t truly affect them, just let people wear their hair, clothes or even makeup however they want. It seems to me like people are just looking for an excuse to get angry.\n\nEdit: Grammar": [

Cultural appropriation does not necessarily describe appropriation with malicious intent, and can apply to ostensibly positive veneration-by-emulation of another culture as well. It also kind of completely undermines your first point to say this, because I do not think you could find many white people who are wearing dreadlocks because of their deep admiration for Viking Culture, or Ancient Greek Culture, or whatever. You would find many more people who are doing it because they want to have an Afro-Caribbean style, which is exactly what people think is the problem",

If you had said that it's not necessarily always cultural appropriation. but your post read, if I'm honest, to me personally a little dismissive of the concept of cultural appropriation and as if the dicussion was unimportant.\n\nNow, the term \"cultural appropriation\" is widely misunderstood. All arguments against it are based on conflating it with cultural exchange and the mixing of cultures, which are unanonimously positive things, that should always be embraced. \n\nNot every culture can be appropriated, only ones that have a long history of being colonized, which has laid the foundation for an equally bad still ongoing neocolonialism. During that the colonialized people's intellectual and creative labour is systematically stolen by the same institutions that also steal their physical labour and material ressources. That is done for profit, but devaluing the colonized peoples common identity and its symbols is a way to prevent resistance. Which is one of the main tools to keep up the political opression that is necessary for the economic exploitation.\n\nA little much political theory. The point is, that individuals, strictly speaking, cannot really culturally appropriate, only governments and companies, but citizens of Western countries, and especially white people, have to be incredibly careful to not become unwitting accomplices of this type of oppression.\n\nSo, white peope who want to wear an important symbol like dreadlocks should be extremely aware of this history. As said, first having this discussion is really important, in my mind it's not someting that should really be done casually.",

You are changing who you are to be similar to a different culture that is not your own. Maybe it’s part of your ancestry ina long stretch, but the fact that you can have the choice of having dreads makes it appropriation. You can have dreads when they are considered fashionable, and you have the option of getting rid of them and looking white again in three shakes of a lambs tail (I’m told that means quickly).   \nyes, arguably, African Americans can also get rid of their dreads, but think of it as ”black face light” or something.

I’m American so this comment will be from that perspective, I’m not sure if hairstyles are as racially charged elsewhere. \n\nThere is a long history in the US of black folks being othered for their hairstyles. Braids, locs, natural afros, super tight curls, all these things have set black Americans apart from white Americans. Even though protective hairstyles like braids and locs are necessary to keep many black hair textures healthy, the look was different than white people and therefore “unprofessional” and unattractive. Only in the last few decades have we begun to undo this conditioning. If you want a way better and way more compelling explanation than mine, Chris Rock made a documentary called “Good Hair” to explain black American culture around hair and it’s fascinating. \n\nAnyway, if you’re from a group who has been historically criticized for the way your hair grows out of your head and then see some white people being able to do the same thing with relatively no scrutiny, you’d be pissed too. Cultural appropriation is not simply borrowing things from other cultures, it’s borrowing them without acknowledging what it means to that culture. In the US, black othering and the existence of “good hair (white hair)” is much more relevant to our culture than Viking matting.\n\nEdit: A lot of people seem to think that this brief explanation of why an oppressed group may be protective of their cultural hairstyles means that I personally would chastise a white person with dreads and that is just not true. All I meant to do was shine some light on why things don’t boil down to “it’s just hair, it doesn’t mean anything.”",

The problem with black culture is it was appropriated, mainstreamed and monetized by the same white America that was promoting ideas & practices that treated black culture and black people like the were inferior, undesirable, immoral, savage, anamalistic, and worthless.  But now, that's the same white america saying, \"oh actually it is a cool valid culture and I want to participate in it.  stop being sensitive let everyone appreciate it\"  even tho for centuries White people actively hated, banned or discriminated against black peoples' practices and styles. \nSo now, Maybe the best way for white people to appreciate the style is respecting and observing how new generations are reclaiming their cultural identities and practicies.  But that's the thing. Most of the time, white people wearing dreds isnt about cultural appreciation or style...its about doing whatever they want just cuz they want to and shouldnt have to worry about how anyone else feels about it. Thats appropriation. And that's a problem of unchecked white privilege and supremacy that keeps on keeping on. So who cares whether or not its appropriation?

Not because of your argument, 9/10 in 2021 it’s definitely cultural appropriation. But I agree with your overall point in that cultural appropriation isn’t inherently negative. It’s only negative when the dominant race or culture (which in America happens to be white people) abuse the group being taken from, even sometimes going so far as to make fun of it, mimic said part of culture, and suddenly that thing is fine. Worse, sometimes it’s still not fine for the group that was taken from, only for the takers.\n\nAnd to that extent, dreads don’t fall into that category simply because white people don’t like dreads on white people lol. If there was this fashion wave of white Americans with dreadlocks, like say how white American women are now wearing long acrylic nails or hoop earrings, that’d be an issue.

I know because I tried to have them in the early 2000’s and as a white person with straight hair it was nearly impossible to keep them going without a ton of work and beeswax. From the roots my hair grows straight so basically had dreads hanging from straight hairs all the time. All my white friends trying to rock dreads—all of whom had curlier hair than me—also had this problem. Descendents of Africans can neglect the shit out of their dreads and they might look gross but they don’t just start unraveling for no good reason. I’m told that really all they need to do is roll the dreads every so often and that’s about it. If that’s true then there’s really nothing natural about dreads for white people.

In an ideal world I’d love for everyone to just pick and choose what ever they feel like, but we’re not living in an ideal world. Me not wearing a bindi/dreadlocks/whatever surely is a small sacrifice compared to the racism (institutionalised and personal) these cultures experience in ‘white’ countries. \n\nI think I’d be interested to hear why a white person would insist on having dreads. I’m assuming it isn’t because it’s a long-standing family tradition, it usually has something to do with an external experience from another culture. Now if that culture tells them that they’d rather not have their culture appropriated, I don’t understand how doing it anyway is appreciating that culture. \n\nAnd as for the Vikings, as you’re saying, you’re ‘fairly certain’. And then from reading some more comments on that, basically no one really knows, but it seems white hair doesn’t naturally dread that easily. So whatever white person is wearing dreads hasn’t seen it on a Viking and thought, oh I want to be like that, because we can’t seem to find a Viking that had dreads.\n\nAnd to touch on your long haired men point as well... I could find you 10 male movie stars with long hair in a minute (but I’m too lazy to do it right now ha ha) with which I’m trying to say, long hair isn’t as defining and rare as dreads in pop-culture.

In my opinion, the majority of dreads are definitely cultural appropriation from that culture.\n\nWhich culture is that?  Well, as far as I can tell, dreads only became popular when Bob Marley became famous.  Marley wore dreads because he was a Rasta.  So really, anyone who wears dreads; whether they're white, black, or whatever, culturally appropriated them from the Rasta.  I'm having trouble finding it now, but there are actually newspaper clippings about Rasta complaining about how the exploding popularity of dreads would dilute their religious meaning.\n\nThere are also Rastafari sects that accept white members.  Their reasoning being that if you go back far enough, we all came from Africa.  So a particular bad case of cultural appropriating would be if a non-Rasta got mad at a white Rasta for wearing dreads.  That's kind of the ultimate cultural appropriation.\n\nI highly encourage people to google about Rastafari and the reason they wear dreads.  It's a really interesting movement/religion.",

            "text": "I think we should separate the question of whether something is cultural appropriation, and whether it is appropriate. (No pun intended)\n\nThe definition of cultural appropriation according to wikipedia for instance is \"Cultural appropriation is the adoption of an element or elements of one culture or identity by members of another culture or identity.\" I think given that definition, dread-wearing by modern-day American whites is cultural appropriation.\n\n>Firstly, I am fairly certain that white people in Ancient Greece, the Celts, Vikings etc would often adopt the dreadlock style, as they wore their hair ‘like snakes’ so to speak. \n\nWhile it may be that Ancient Greeks, Ancient Celts and Vikings might have work dreadlocks and it is true that their culture was influential on ours, their culture is not ours. For instance, central to all their cultures was a pantheon of deities which survive today only as myths. The Greeks practiced peredastry. Vikings divided their society between rigid social classes, Jarls, Karls and Thralls. Those are examples of central aspects of those cultures that are completely absent from the culture of modern day white Americans. If you transported people from those cultures to this day, they would be utterly baffled by our practices. The American disapproval of public alcohol consumption for instance would be shocking to people who drank alcohol all the time. Socrates would be shocked and appaled when he made a pass at a 10-year-old boy and was immediatey hauled off to jail for it. If you went back to Ancient Athenes, most people would be baffled by why you're so upset about slavery and domestic violence. The culture shock in both direction would be immense.\n\nFrom this, I think we should conclude that while these cultures are influential on our own culture, they are not our own culture. I think it's fair to say that modern-day white American culture does not have dread-wearing as an element. I think it's also not controversial that wearing dreads is an element of several modern-day cultures such as, most famously, the Rastafari.\n\nNow, some white people might discover wearing dreadlocs themselves independently of any other culture. Those would not be instances of cultural appropriation. They just rediscovered the same thing. However, most modern-day American whites will first hear of dreadlocks from cultures others than their own and their adoption of the hairstyle will be inspired by those other cultures. In other words, when modern-day American whites wear dreadlocks, for the most part, they are adopting the cultural practice of another culture. It might be African-American culture or Rastafari culture. But it might also be Viking culture. In all such cases, it is cultural appropriation.\n\n>At the end of the day, why does anyone care what hairstyle another person has? It doesn’t truly affect them, just let people wear their hair, clothes or even makeup however they want. It seems like me people are just looking for an excuse to get angry.\n\nI think here you and I are much closer to agreement. I would say dreadlocks are cultural appropriation, but so what? Cultural appropriation isn't necessarily bad and it is part of how we all live a richer life. Making and eating sushi is totally cultural appropriation, but I'm not giving it up. It's fun and delicious. I would say that inherently, there is nothing wrong with wearing dreadlocks.\n\nHowever, the fact that it's not inherently bad is not the end of the investigation. (Or at least, it should not be) After all, you're not wearing dreadlocks (if you wear them) in an abstract void of pure reason. (As much as I'd like to live there, people refuse to show me the way.) You're wearing them within a context. And that context includes a number of things:\n\n1. There is a long history of \"natural hairstyles\" being used to discriminate against African-Americans. And by long-history, I mean it's something that still happens.\n2. On the other hand, white people are not usually similarly-penalized for wearing similar hairstyles.\n\nWhat that means is that a black person seeing a white person wearing dreads might understandably be reminded of this unfairness. And that's going to feel bad. Being treated unfairly sucks for everyone. Having someone rub it in your face (even unintentionally) also sucks. So there is a sense in which it is considered inconsiderate to do. (Sort of like bragging about the awesome present your parents bought you to your friend who comes from a much poorer family.)\n\nThis is then somewhat compounded by what economists sometimes call an unraveling effect. So we have established, not wearing dreads is a nice thing to do. So, people who are particularly nice will go along with it. After all, they're extra-nice people. Well, what that means is that the average niceness of the person wearing dreads falls. (After all, the nicest ones will stop wearing dreads) So now, slightly less nice people will realize that by wearing dreads, they are signaling their membership in a slightly-less-nice-than-average group of people. They probably don't want that, so they stop wearing dreads. And slowly that process continues until the people who still wear dreads are either oblivious or are fine with everyone thinking they are dicks.\n\nSo now, we have reached a point where if you wear dreads as a white person, the message people get from you is \"I'm oblivious or kind of a dick\". And well, both being oblivious AND being a dick are bad things to be. So people will look at your dreads, conclude \"this guy is a dick/oblivious\" and treat you as such. Which is pretty much identical to treating you like someone who did something bad.",

Among non-\"white\" people, dreadlocks logically weren't suddenly the norm everywhere. If you consider just subsaharian African people during the antiquity, you have to remember that just like today or for any social group categorized by skin pigmentation, it's never a monolith, ergo even if for logically flawed reasons you think cultural appropriation is a meaningful concept, you'd have to concede that it has always also happened within ethnic groups.",

            "text": "So i’m not an expert but I see a lot of posts misunderstanding the concept of cultural appropriation. Yes, people like what they like and that’s fine but cultural appropriation is when you’re using a piece of someone’s culture without understanding it’s significance or meaning within the culture. particularly with cultures that have dealt with being slowly erased. Or people who’ve suffered persecution for their cultures. Some of the most obvious examples are Native American and African cultures in America. A lot of people from these cultures have dealt with a great deal of racism systematic and otherwise throughout their lives and have lost a lot of their culture. When what they do have left, their symbols and rituals, are appropriated, those symbols further lose their meaning. Furthermore on a corporate level this will happen much faster than on an individual level as the corporations profit from these symbols being sold in mass without context. \n\nA good example of this is native American head dresses. They’re all the same right? Something to do with being the “chief”? It’s what you wear when you want to show that you’re Native American for Halloween. Because Native Americans all dressed the same right? Their cultures were erased - are being erased - and then sold along side the vampire and dragon costumes. When you put on a headdress, you have no idea what it means. It’s likely the people who made it don’t either. This wouldn’t be as big a problem  (a little disrespectful) if the culture was widespread and there were plenty of people to carry on traditions but when you’re a in the minority, it has a huge impact.\n\nI’m not sure hairstyles fall into this category, I don’t know that it’s significant to their culture. I don’t think dreadlocks are unique to African-Americans. I’ve heard some argument regarding white people doing some thing like getting dreadlocks without suffering the stigma and persecution for it that African-Americans have for years. but I think that’s more an issue of white privilege then of cultural appropriation. \n\nCulture has always been an ever shifting thing and it could be argued that appropriation is a normal part of cultures evolution. But I think I’ll leave that for another post or for someone who knows more than me to argue.",

At the beginning of the pandemic, I came across KnotNation on YouTube. I learned all the proper and healthy ways to take care of/clean my hair without brushing.

            "text": "I believe you are technically correct that dreadlocks are not cultural appropriation because cultures all around the world have their own version, but reason this is an issue is because black people have been punished for wearing dreads.\n\nFor decades black hairstyles have been seen as unprofessional, unkept, and unclean. As a result of this racism there is a myth that any black hairstyle that differs from white beauty standards is dirty, especially dreads. This myth is perpetuated by some non black people with dreads, because their dreads are clumps of unwashed hair, dirt, and mold instead of a maintained hair style. So the argument can be made that people with dreads, a hairstyle from multiple cultures, who do not maintain their hair correctly and instead purposefully keep them as unwashed messes are appropriating and disrespecting a culture symbol, and this is problematic because then more people assume all dreadlocks are dirty as a result, and punish black peoples for it. [The video has been made private, but here is an example of TMZ harassing the Weekend about his dreads, until an black staffer educated the rest of the room.](https://www.mic.com/p/paddington-2-has-officially-ousted-citizen-kane-as-the-greatest-film-of-all-time-75270220) \n \nI also think it didn’t really matter if it’s cultural appropriation. The issue isn’t really white people wearing dreadlocks like the ancient Greeks, Celtics, or Vikings. Vikings are known for being incredibly clean, and I find it hard to believe they didn’t maintain their dreads. But also if someone wanted to just stop washing their hair and have dreads that way, that’s also their right too, because it isn’t their fault that a racist sees their hair and assumes all black people dreads are gross, or that a racist finds white dreads acceptable but black dreads disgusting.

As a 5 year old I would go over to their houses to play and have dinner. I was a twin so my friends usually got a 2 for 1 deal of having their white American friends over. They didn't fully realize I was from a multicultural household, myself being multinational. This meant that they were often embarrassed by their parents assuming I would think their culture was weird.  \n\n\nThe parents on the other hand were happy that I was accepting and interested in their cultures. The music, food, customs. When we came in from playing outside and I took my shoes off at the door they were happy I respected that rule. When I ate their home cooked meals. Usually my friends would be embarrassed and try to convince their parents to order a pizza or something.   \n\n\nTheir parents experienced an America that could be very unwelcoming of their culture, often times they were pressured to assimilate. Their children grew up in an America that was changing, their parents culture became trendy and popular. Its a tricky situation. 30 or 40 years ago people might have been delighted to see Americans embracing their cultures. Now those same people have children that feel exploited because those cultures are being appropriated.  \n\n\nHere is where I am a little torn. Those kids, my friends, their culture isnt being appropriated because its not their culture. What I mean is that there are macro cultures and micro cultures. Even a workplace can have its own culture. If they werent born there, didnt grow up there, havnt lived there in decades then its hard to call it their culture. The whole melting pot and fusion of cultures has created an entirely new identity.   \n\n\nI guess my point is that cultural appropriation is a sort of new generation problem. It seems that most of the people concerned about it aren't even native to those cultures either.   \nI am a HUGE white passer, meaning I am from another culture but because my other half is from a mix while super white European countries I am also very white. Since I am a American I cant really even identify as those European cultures and since I'm white theres this sort of stigma for me to openly identify as the culture I was actually raised in. After traveling around the world for 2 years I have to say that there a very few things about any culture that are unique.  \n\n\nI know I didnt address the very real discrimination that POC and immigrants faced in the workplace. My entire take could be complete shit. I just always think about the immigrants, with older American children, I know and how they would have killed to have their culture so widely accepted when they first moved here.",

Those who “rebelled” against racism and stood up by claiming their heritage had African style hair. Even today, there has been instances where black people have been discriminated due to their style. \n\nToday: given the social atmosphere and the freedom of being yourself and discrimination being called out there are those who are very keen on claiming and preserving their heritage. Some go to the extreme of thinking should someone of different heritage use African hairstyles it is as if they are trying to steal it. \n\nCultural appreciation ≠ Cultural appropriation \n\nSome are unable to see a difference between these two and recognise them. People who use braids, dreadlocks etc who sincerely like them and appreciate their origin, instead of mocking or insulting it, are not invading nor stealing it. They are appreciating it and by it bringing it out as normal just like African Americans. \n\nThose who make it a gag or mock it are the bad ones. \n\nIf you don’t allow people to appreciate and respect your heritage/style by wearing a simple hair style you are enforcing the division that was created by the other side. Before the hairstyles were racially discriminated, now there are those who crate opposite division by denying others to respect and appreciate your hairstyles/culture. \n\nAs long as your intent is not to demean or insult a culture/heritage it should be okay to wear/do things. The reason why some people yell cultural appropriation is push back for being discriminated by the ancestors of the other cultural group (in this case white people back in the day discriminating black people).\n\nYou cannot fight for equality by causing more separation or backwards discrimination however people going on this path is inevitable, as in fight fire with fire.",

Your strictures and irrationally imposed taboos upon someone’s ability to braid their hair a certain way is not only regressive but incredibly intrusive and self-important. The historical persecution of a group of people does not inherently preclude society from enjoying and adopting parts of their culture, whether or not you want that to be true. And if you argue otherwise to the point of forcibly imposing these restrictions, congratulations you have become that which you claim to despise. Ridiculousness and this argument baffles me every time I see it. As one commenter said, even thought he was arguing for the anti-white-dreadlock stance (LOL), “any opinion on this matter is inherently subjective”. That’s funny... almost like religious statutes that have no basis in logic or reality, but are instead enforced based on others’ metaphysically derived notions of “right and wrong”. That being said, as an opinion, it then deserves the same amount of skepticism as religion because it entirely lacks a coherent logical argument.

The oldest record of dreadlocks goes to the native Americans if I remember correctly, and some Celtic tribes did have similar styles.\n\nHowever there's one important detail, the style of dreadlocks. Most people desire  the modern loose/grown out look. (Denzel curry, Bob Marley, most Jamaicans you'll see etc) and the harsh fact is that in order to have the look, you need to have black genetics. Black hair naturally curls/gets nappy like a spring or coil. Dreadlocks are literally made but twisting our hair and leaving it alone. It will naturally contort itself into the tight solid \"lock\" with little intervention. Most other races hair is natural straight or relaxed. \n\nIn order for  most whites to gain dreadlocks they have to go to a expert who knows specifically how to do it with that hair texture, I've seen people turned away in my hair salon that specializes in braids because no one knew how to do it with white hair. \n\nTL:DR White hair texture is not made for mainstream dreadlocks. Many black people feel as though your trying to ram a square in a round hole \"for the look\" when modern beauty standards are normally opposed to black hair",

We are talking about stone tablets depicting this sort of hair style or on a cave wall somewhere etc.\n\nIt is damn near in every ancient culture that scribbled some drawings on a rock.\n\nTBH seeing as many cultures have had this hair form since the beginning of time then its probably highly spiritual.
