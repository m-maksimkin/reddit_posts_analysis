    "CMV: Stylists not knowing how to work with African American hair isn't racist\nHey everyone, I just watched [John Oliver's latest LWT on the topic of African American hair](https://youtu.be/Uf1c0tEGfrU). I want to preface this by saying that I tend to agree with most of the talking points on LWT, and I'm very far left on the political spectrum. That's why I was pretty surprised when I found myself at odds with this [particular point](https://youtu.be/Uf1c0tEGfrU?t=709) (timestamp).\n\n>\"...but finding a qualified stylist can be even harder. The cosmetology industry mostly revolves around and trains for caring for straight, non-textured hair. So, there is no guarantee that a stylist in your area can work with black hair. Just watch one Tik-Tok'er...\"\n\nThe way that this point is framed, in the context of the video, is that it's racist not to have stylists which can properly cut and style black hair types. But doesn't this just *make sense* from the point of view of a stylist or salon? Chances are, if you live in *most* places across the US, your customer base is not going to be a large or even sizeable chunk of black people with textured hair. So why would you waste money hiring someone who has gone through extra training to cut and style black hair when those skills won't be needed very often?\n\nSomeone might say, \"well, this problem goes back to the root of their training; why *aren't* most stylists taught to handle black hair?\" To that, I have the same answer. It's not a common for stylists to have to deal with it on the floor-- that time spent training for a specific hair type might be better used practicing techniques that they will commonly use in the work force, rather than specializing.\n\nFurthermore, this talking point continues on using a clip from Tik-Tok of a girl calling 23 different salons before finding a salon which can work with 4c hair. The way it's framed in the context of the video, it's supposed to make you go, \"oh my gosh, I can't believe she had to call so many places just to find one that can work with her hair type! That's so unfair :( \"\n\nBut, really, it's not unfair by the stylists. I personally have colored hair-- It's currently blue, but I've been dying it crazy colors ever since middle school. But the trouble is, if you want something wild and specific like I do, you have to find a professional to do it for you (unless you're REALLY good at bleaching your own hair... I am not). All of your generic salons like Holiday Hair and Supercuts don't have people trained to do that. I had to hunt down a place which specialized in crazy dyes. Nobody would look at my situation and go, \"oh my gosh, I can't believe she had to call so many places just to find one that can work with her hair type! That's so unfair :( \"\n\nWe can recognize that I need a someone with a specialized, specific skillset to work with my hair... It's not unfair to me that such stylists aren't in every salon.\n\nSo, in conclusion, what exactly am I missing here? Like I said before, I tend to agree with LWT so I'm sure I'm just missing something super obvious. And I also agree with the rest of the video; locking up black hair products is fucked up and so are office dress codes. It's just this one point that's not landing with me.\n\n***Edit (My view has been changed):***\n\nI think I found the missing component. I was under the impression that the reason stylists aren't taught to work with black hair stemmed from something pragmatic, like the fact that those requests don't come in as often and they might be harder to handle. However, it seems like this isn't the case-- it's just the remnants of outdated and overtly racist cosmetology of the days of old. In essence, it's the old racism nobody ever bothered to fix properly and now actively requires correction.\n\nI see a lot of people here using the comparison to accommodating for people with disabilities, and I'm honestly not sure that line of reasoning will make any ground with me. I think that, ultimately, we should be accommodating for disabilities... but if we're gonna do that, make it *all disabilities*. No half measures. That, or we go the complete opposite direction and impose no requirements. Morally, I think we should do the former. But as for what we can impose legally, ehhhh.... I also take issue with the fact that we're comparing having a certain hair type to a disability. I'm working on articulating exactly what about that I take issue with and why, but for now, I'll leave it at \"this line of thinking won't change my views.\"\n\nMini Edit:\n\nA lot of people here are making some really good points, and I really wish I could go through and delta all of them which articulate the point mentioned in the above edit, but this post has almost 1000 comments and I am just one person. Thanks for all of the help to those of you who are positive and patient... because goddamn, *not all of you are*.  ": [

There are a significant amount of these establishments and very few that are establishments like the ones John Oliver discusses. \n\nI like to wear my hair in French braids. It’s easy, manageable, stays for a few days and keeps me from having to wash my hair or use heat products on it. I am white. I have “white” hair although it is thicker and coarser than that of most white people. Many of the places here (Great Clips, Supercuts, etc) are not doing braids/styles right now. I called 10 AA owned establishments that specialize in braiding. None of these places were willing to braid my hair. Two braids, would maybe take 20-25 minutes, and I’d be at the very least, a once a week client for myself and my daughter. Do I chalk it up to them not “knowing” how to work on my hair?\n\nNo. Because of this post, I now chalk it up to a double standard. Hair stylists are considered artists because to be frank, hair is an art. Artists can choose what projects they do and don’t want to work on based on their interests/specializations.

You're actually making the argument that having *more* skills is bad. So you literally only want workers to be able to help or assist majority populations? Why should my job waste time hiring a Spanish speaker when, most of the time, people are going to be speaking English? Oh, that single Spanish speaking person that's going to need our help? Fuck 'em. They need to go somewhere else. Why should I waste money building a ramp into my store? Most of the people entering are going to be able-bodied. If you're in a wheelchair, fuck you. Why should movie theaters have accessibility headphones for people that are hard of hearing? Fuck them. \n\nI can go on and on. But what you're advocating for is literal bigotry and exclusion for those in minority populations. Maybe if these people were trained in Type 4 hair, there would be more people willing to go to these places. Not to mention, to work in a salon, you need to get a license. Lawyers have to understand obscure, niche law procedures and terms just at the off chance they come up. I don't think it's too much to ask for cosmetology schools to put in effort to make sure their stylists understand how to work with multiple hair types. That's their literal profession.\n\nEdit: I also want to point out that you're also advocating for people that know how to style white *and* black hair to be passed up for opportunities in salons in favor of those that only know how to style white hair because most of the clients will be white anyway.

If you’re a type 4 and can’t find someone to help you do regular detangling, treatments and/or protective styles once in a while, your hair won’t be healthy, your scalp is probably a mess and it can have negative implications for school/work/personal relationships. Not all black people have type 4, just like not only black people have type 4, but the fact someone trained in hair can’t work with type 4 probably also means they can’t work with type 3 either, outside of blow drying it straight and cutting it like it were wavy or straight hair.

It’s required in many states to maintain a license, even. Stylists might be afraid of messing up a texture they’re unfamiliar with, but that fear is not an acceptable reason to not provide a service they provide others— wash, cut, style. Does everyone need to know how to do box braids or sew in a weave?  No. But if you do extensions on white clients and turn away black ones, you should look in the mirror and figure out why you have such problematic business practices. There’s dozens of extension systems on the market; telling a client what you have and letting them say no, I prefer something else is fine.

It's not a common for stylists to have to deal with it on the floor-- that time spent training for a specific hair type might be better used practicing techniques that they will commonly use in the work force, rather than specializing.\n\nHere's how I see it: I went to college for secondary education (US, grade 7-12) specializing in English/Language Arts. \n\nMy first 2 years of college were general: math, science, history, English, etc...took a few classes of math, science and history (as required) to make sure I was at least understanding of the basics. \n\nBecause my main degree is English, I also learned various topics within that topic: history of English language, linguistics, writing, research, grammar, and what not. Back and forth I learned the ins and outs of English to make sure I knew my field. We can ignore the first two years if you want and just focus on my last two years.\n\nMy second 2 years were starting to dig into education. My specialization was older kids and public school but I was required to learn childhood pedagogy, special education, diverse learning tactics, and more. Just to make sure that would be ready to help any student that walked through my door. Did I expect to have a 14 year old somalian refugee with hearing problems end up in my class? Nope, but you can bet your ass I was ready with IEPs and knowledge to help that kid.\n\nWith stylists, I expect them to learn about hair. All hair. What type, what affects it, how to care for it, how to style it: everything. They should all have the basic understand of HAIR, no matter then skin it is growing from. They should know how to dye hair - they might not be the best at it and that's why I have paid out the nose for a well reviewed and rather stylist specializing in color. And for a stylist trained in the Curly Girl method. I expect all stylists to have learned how to dye hair but hair is an art form and I can see where someone might shine in a field. I've been to a ton of stylists that cane from the same school and you can tell when you find a good one. They all learned basically the same, but their practice of it and skill at it differ. \n\nDo I expect them to be experts in all hair? No. I am not an expert in every part of English. But I know English and I know how to teach it. I can, and do, know about black history when it comes to literature and of course it was in my lesson plans.\n\nTo not include black history, Japanese history, native American/tribal history, Mexican history...you get the point...to not have included those in my lessons would have made me a bad teacher. \n\nTo not know how to do a type of hair is being a bad stylist. Your job is hair. Learn hair.\n\nAnd if it is not taught, those are bad schools.\n\nIf those products are not sold, that is a bad store. \n\nTo not have the ability, let alone the shades, to do black makeup in the makeup industry means you're a bad makeup artist. \n\nIgnorance doesn't mean racism but it sure don't help the case when the establishment is conveniently ignorant. Stylists need to be taught. I learned how to teach students of varying cultures and backgrounds in 2 years. Surely a stylist can learn black hair in their year on average of school.\n\nJust because you are in a homogenous region, doesn't mean your education shouldn't include those outside your contact. You might be out of practice, you might not specialize, you might not be comfortable - but you should KNOW and have LEARNED. \n\nI HAD to learn how to help those with disabilities, those with home problems, those with bad days, those from different cultures, different religions, different backgrounds, different ages, different sexes - that was required of me, as it should have been, because even if I ended up being in the whitest most Christian school ever...someone could walk through my door needing help. Whether it was yet another cheerleader with a concussion (I hate contact sports) or a refugee child needing an interpreter. \n\nJust a little English teacher just slogging through The Crucible again and I had to learn how to spot childhood sexual assault symptoms. Surely, a hair stylist can learn to style hair, all hair.",

I think you are largely missing the point on it. \n\nFirst, you say if you live in \"most places\". Full stop and think about that. Why would \"most places\" not necessitate having a black client base? America is not fully white, 13-15% are black or mixed. That is not uncommon, that is 1 in 8. The only way a black client base is not accessible is if they dont live there. And while we still have de jure segregated neighborhoods, most hair salons are not neighborhood salons. So the reason black customers dont frequent the same salons you refer to is because of the same reason John Oliver pointed out. Which brings me to my second point.\n\nIt's not racist to have any one stylist not be comfortable with handling black/4c hair, just like some stylists wouldn't want to do a lot of dyeing. It is racist to not purposefully hire someone with the qualifications and experience of handling black hair, with the sole expectation that they would/could potentially handle their black clientele. By not having anyone who can handle that type of hair, they have essentially excluded a clientele base and have made a statement that they dont want that basis.\n\nFinally, it wasn't explicitly stated, but the implicit indication for that tik-tok user having to call over 23 salons was that none of them had a black hair stylist. Even if their cosmetology license doesn't go into enough depth on handling black hair, a black stylist likely would have experimented with their own hair and knows how to handle and style it. So not only have these salons not hired someone to specifically handle black hair, they havent even hired any black stylists.",

He sat down expected a haircut and became incredibly angry and disturbed when my Sister apologized and told him that she doesn't know how to cut black hair, nor does anyone else in the salon and recommended that if he wanted a smooth and good cut that he should go to a salon where they specialize in cutting black hair. That's all she said, nothing racist and nothing bad.  Unfortunately the guy lost his mind enraged and made a scene and walked out all pissed off. My sister felt bad but she's never cut black folk's hair before since she always worked in our Latino communities since we're Latino, never has any black man or woman gone to cut hair with her or her previous salons I'm guessing because they probably know they won't know how to cut black hair without damaging or hurting their customers so they just avoid it overall. My best friend is black and my Sister has a ton of black friends but they all go to her for nails instead because she's the best tech in the entire area but never step onto her chair because they go elsewhere for haircuts. Anyways the guy left and a few hours later he comes back with I'm guessing his mother or relative to berate my Sister and everyone in the salon whilst recording phones and whatnot making a huge scene and everything. My Sister tried her best to deescalate and explain but the guy or the woman weren't having any of it and we're being just annoying and disturbing her clients and customers so she just asked them to leave. They left to avoid any police or anything but not until the guy went to record himself on his phone completely making up lies about how they were racist to him and kicked him out and everything. \nMy Sister was smart though as she always records her sessions and clients on a GoPro in her station and she captured everything on it with the truth. I don't think she had anymore problems after that but the guy hasn't come back. Sounded to me like a choosing beggar who thought he'd get a cheaper price at her salon than at his barber or other salon. That or he legit doesn't know the difference between black hair cutting techniques. \n\nTL;DR Sister cuts hair in Latino salon, black guy accuses her of racism because she doesn't know how to cut black hair.",

The racism lies in the overall manner in which black people's particular needs have pretty much been  ignored or neglected by society as a whole because of an underlying systemic discrimination that  primarily caters to a white audience.

The fact that there is someone on staff whose job it is to prepare the artists to perform but they can not do their job for someone because they don't know how to work with that kind of hair is unfair to these performers. Also if it is going to be part of your job, invest in some training or something. I know it probably takes a lot of training but if it's something you are going to be asked to do you should know how to do it and not just assume you can pass off your duties to the performer who is already having to think about other things.  Or the company you are working for should hire someone who can,  even just temporarily. It isn't new or rare to have black people in our field. The fact that they have to take more of that burden on themselves while other performers have someone to do the work for them is slightly racist and makes people feel like an outsider where they work.",

When I walked in — there were a couple of black people — and the stylist looked at me strange. I am white and have light brown hair. When I told him that I wanted a haircut, he asked me if I was sure. Twice. \n\nI didn’t think much about it. It seemed cheap — like $20 — and convenient. So I said of course I was sure.\n\nIt was a strange experience. I don’t think they had scissors, or if they did, they didn’t use them on me. Instead they used some sort of clippers with hot plates. I remember they left light burns on my skin.  It felt like it was a blunt instrument for my hair and the guy didn’t seem like he had much experience with my hair type.\n\nAt the end, it was a pretty fast though somewhat unpleasant experience. I didn’t think that much about my hair at the time, but I knew it wasn’t my best haircut. Nor was it my worst — that would have been what I gave myself when I was 9 or so. \n\nI never went back and would not consider going to a salon that specializes in black hair. Unless I had no choice of course. Say if I lived in Nigeria, I probably would go, but even then I would call around every salon to see if anyone does white hair.",

To add to that, most cosmetology schooling leaves students unprepared to actually start working and most programs should be much longer than they really are. \n\nThat being said, the starting pay for chain salons (the only places willing to hire new stylists with no experience) is $7.50. Which means your stylist would need to go pay $300-$500 for a specialized textured hair class after they’ve already gone through their licensing. That’s an entire paycheck. After they’ve already paid $20,000+ to go to school and are living on poverty wages.\n\nYour stylist isn’t being racist but the state/ cosmetology programs are simply not extensive enough. The system needs changed for a lot of reason. To be honest I barely knew how to do a basic men’s haircut when I left school let alone a textured bob or a color service on non-straight hair. In my state we don’t even take a practical test, just written. \n\nTLDR: State board of cosmetology regulates unimportant shit instead of actually making sure stylists are trained well.",

Blue hair is unnatural, whereas Afro textured hair is just as natural to certain ethnic groups as straight hair is to others. In other words, nobody is born with blue hair, whereas plenty of people are born with Afro textured hair. So it makes sense to call blue hair \"wild and specific\", but when you compare that to Afro textured hair, you're implying that Afro textured hair is also wild and specific like blue hair. Afro textured hair is not wild, it's just the way the hair grows out of the scalp.",

I’m not a braider though and feel that is a specific area of hair you specialize in. In school we had specific mannequins to practice With courser hair but it was never as curly as real hair. I got more experience just from real life in the salon. We do get calls asking if we can do African American hair bc it is a real problem of stylists not knowing how to cut it or properly maintenance it. If it’s just a quick trim or even blow out style I’d say most competent stylists are capable. When it comes to more intricate styles is where specialties come in.",

No one is saying an individual is a bad person for not having learned something (though keep in mind during this comment that their education is their responsibility). These people are professionals so went to school for this. An industry that graduates you with a curriculum where you only know how to style one racial hair type is racist. Your comment about people having to go through \"extra\" training to cut black hair has racist premise. This is like a dermatologist only knowing how to treat white skin. It wouldn't pass muster.\n\nYou suggest that most stylists all over the country just don't have to worry about it because they'll never see black people. That's absurd (sorry I don't mean it in a mean way but nicer words escape me), black people are not unicorns. It is not acceptable to *plan* on not being able to service them, as that is racism. \n\nNow individual stylists are allowed to specialize and get great at coloring, or great at dreadlocks, or great at blowwouts or haircuts or whatever. But to run a salon and answer a customer's call with \"we don't see your kind because we never bothered to get fully trained\" is racist. It's not like there's 200 wildly different hair types to worry about",

            "text": "Frankly, yes. At this point, the refusal to take on more textured hair products and clientele is hurting nothing but their bottom dollar.\n\nThe amount of income potential beauty and hair companies could generate from curly hair textures and darker skin tones is massive. Black hairstyles - not considering labor and install - usually cost between 150 and 300 dollars per visit. These visits happen once a month for most women, maybe even less. The amount of hair care products I use (due to the variety of products that frankly DONT work for my hair type, thus forcing me into a continuous cycle of purchase-trial-repeat) is at least four times the volume of all my straight haired buddies. Each of these products (about 10) cost ~15 bucks and I use a whole container in about two months. Last time I checked, most of the traditional hair care systems for straight hair have far less components, cost half of what I’m paying, and last twice as long. Pantene is like two for $5, a good deep conditioner is $20. Black people are in are undergoing a renaissance of beauty product purchasing that requires a higher rate of collection and consumption than straight hair tends to need. Its an 8.5 billion dollar subsection - 10 percent of the full market, but poised to grow. And that’s just the products. If there’s any portion of my income that I would dispose, it’d be for my hair. And I think many other curlies would agree.\n\nLearning how to style and work with a new type of hair is a skill thats immutable - after the point of learning, the cost-benefit only increases. Why would such money-forward capitalists be willing to trade years of profit and continuous patronage (because its SO hard to find trusted stylists anywhere) for a few hundred extra dollars and 20 more hours of training. \n\nIts not just money, my man.
