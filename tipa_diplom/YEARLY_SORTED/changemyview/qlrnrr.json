    "CMV: Trans people should disclose that they are trans before sleeping with someone\n\nCards on the table, Although I don't feel like i have a bias against trans women I would feel \"ashamed\" if my friends found out. As if I was scared of the ridicule and opinions of others. \n\nIt's also hard to say that I'm not attracted to them because I'm a straight male and I do believe if a man wants to transition to a woman because that's who she is and that's what is inside her, then that person is a woman, but personally I don't ever want to sleep a person who used to be a man. \n\nYou probably won't see me marching in unity for them, but neither would I counter protest them for wanting to be treated more fairly and equally.\n\nAll I know is I would be mentally and emotionally disturbed if I slept with a woman only to find out the next day she used to be a man. Nothing against trans people but it's not for me. Unless it was Brittany Daniel from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\n\nEDIT: Whoa, so this exploded a bit. Its given me a bit of time to think. Im not sure if I'm allowed to rescind a delta or not, but spoiler alert, I would if I could.\nI played a bit of devil's advocate, and I recognise my language may have been a bit triggering in the initial post. However reading a lot of this hearty debate has helped me compile many of my thoughts on the entire Trans debate. Thank you.": [

It causes a very real and irrational reaction to things that are harmless. Imagine someone talking about how disturbed they were when they realized that a person they slept with was actually a jew. Or wore contacts, or was not a natural blonde, etc... Your reaction would be genuine confusion or outrage over the obvious antisemitism.\n\nThat's why we are trying to normalize these things so people won't react in very destructive ways to things that are absolutely harmless.

I'm also lesbian, so take this from the perspective of someone who wouldn't be compatible with you anyway, and isn't offended.\n\n1. I'm 36, and I didn't realize that I was trans until last year. Even given that, I was never a man. I had a body that looked like a man's, but the thing is that the human body has all the blueprints it needs to have a masculine or feminine configuration--all it really needs is the testosterone or estrogen to tell it which way to go. I actually passed my first year on HRT recently, and you can check out my profile to see just how true that statement is--estrogen alone makes a huge difference. That said, when I talk about never having been a man, I mean that those typical \"boy\" feelings and experiences? They never fit me at all. Masculinity was like wearing a poorly fitting costume that I just never realized I could take off.\n2. There's a really good reason for a trans person to not disclose their trans status: their physical safety. As a trans woman, I'm about 15 times more likely to be assaulted, raped, or murdered as an average woman (actually, over 50% of all hate crimes perpetrated against LGBTQ+ people as a whole are committed against trans women *specifically*, and those numbers are from the FBI and don't include like 20 states, so the actual numbers are probably higher). Most of those crimes are committed in the exact situation you're describing--theyre dating violence as the direct result of disclosure. What, to you, is a question of potential shame is, to us, a life-or-death choice. \n\nI won't shame you in any way for your hesitation to be with us. Internalized transphobia is a real thing, even for us. Heck, I struggle with it in regards to *myself* from time to time. American society is really good at making us feel that way. Personally, if I were dating, I'd be public from the outset of dating, but I'm unusually safe in my life; if you live, say, in the deep south, doing so is publicly advertising to people who hate you that you exist and are local.\n\nFor a lot of us, it's to be between the devil and the deep blue sea. And, for this reason, a *lot* of us preferentially date other trans people (t4t is the shorthand), just because it's a lot safer.\n\n**Edit**: I've been getting responses from people who are describing what I've said using pretty awful terms. One even said that they prefer having sex with white girls to having sex with black girls, and that that doesn't make them racist, or that their penis touching a vagina that was made from a penis is disgusting.\n\nI'll let you all ponder the implications of that stance, and the people who make it. White boys not wanting to have sex with black girls. Sounds... somehow familiar. Reminiscent of other, similar arguments which we, as members of the public, have had in the past. Perhaps about racism.\n\nMore importantly, I invite people to read those responses and then re-read my point #2. This is precisely *why* trans women, especially, are at heightened risk of rape, assault, and murder--and black trans women are at the highest risk of all.\n\nI'm not going to engage with people who can't accept the fundamental premise that a trans person is the gender that they say they are. I'm sorry; the AMA and the APA have been *really clear* on this one--trans folx are the gender they say they are. If you can't accept that fact, we have no common basis in reality from which we can argue constructively.\n\n**Edit edit**: If you want a larger discussion of this exact thing, there's a documentary about it on Netflix. It is literally called Disclosure. It was made by trans people, and it lays clear how and why it's dangerous to disclose, and how mass media depictions of us have caused that to be the case.",

If you are physically attracted to someone with their clothes on, you'll be physically attracted to them with their clothes off most of the time -- pretty much regardless of plumbing. What makes for sexual attraction is largely in the brain. It has to do with how a person behaves and responds towards you.\n\nIf you're a submissive, straight male, then you likely won't be attracted to a submissive trans woman, for example. You'll find your way to someone who's behaviors indicate that they are interested in the kinds of interactions that you are interested in. As such, it's likely that at the end of the day you, and they, will be relatively satisfied with the encounter.\n\nThe presence or absence of a particular organ won't change that. You wouldn't, for example, say that a woman who was born with [vaginal agenesis](https://www.childrenshospital.org/conditions-and-treatments/conditions/v/vaginal-agenesis) and couldn't engage in penetrative vaginal intercourse that she disclose that fact before having a sexual encounter, would you?

People can end up upset the next morning if they find out that the person they slept with isn't exactly what they imagined.\n\nHowever, each of these items exist on a spectrum, and I think it's widely understood that people don't share everything about themselves -- even on a first date.\n\nThe argument that people should disclose their HIV/STD status before sex sits on the principle that people can actually biologically harm the other person if it isn't disclosed. Since health/safety is at stake in this case, I agree that an HIV-positive individual should disclose their status to their sexual partner in advance. However, the trans-ness of an individual has no bearing on the health/safety of their partner, so in my view it sits equivalently as an ordinary secret that many people keep (i.e. drugs, ex-relationships) from their sexual partners early on.",

            "text": "When I turned 13, I was into girls. At 16 1/2, I was introduced to the man that would become my husband. I fell in love after spending one day with him. My grandmother picked him and my marriage was arranged when I was 17. We married a month after my 19th birthday. Before we were intimate (wedding night) he went and had all STD panels ran and presented them to me. I asked him to get them because he had unprotected sex with a couple of women. He was 26 years old. No problem. He did it. No STD’s. We’ve been married for 24 years. And death is the only thing that will part us. \n\nAs the world has grown and changed, I decided that if he were to die, I’d probably date women. Men that are in their 40’s-50’s are just set on finding a woman 15 to 20 years younger and end up with a redo family. No thanks! \n\nI had two friends in my 20’s; one was intersex but identified as female even though she looked like a man and the other was a 6’3 drop dead gorgeous MTF with impeccable style! I loved both these women dearly as friends and that when I became involved in Trans rights. My History Prof was the Dean over the history department and allowed me to organize a group that took over men’s restrooms because of the way they that some men had treated both of my friends. If it was a man that wasn’t slinging bs, we would leave the restroom without even being asked. Most of those men joined us in protest. It was cool. \n\nBoth women were fetishized and that’s an ugly experience. I’m 1/4 Nigerian and the rest is mixes of different Jews (Ashkenazi, Mizrahi, Sephardic). Plenty of racist white  guys tried talking to me after school. I would shake my head and just say no. I had family in the Klan that I spent summers with in the country. My great-grandmother had remarried when she was 24 because my great grandfather died and left her with 2 children and they adopted another. He loved my father and me. \n\nThose racist assholes, whom I love dearly, loved me and because they loved me, they protected me and changed. They told me to always tell a man I was black because if I didn’t and we started dating that that man would rape me. My black side gave me the same advise. \n\nThey both told me to watch their eyes turn when I told them my ethnicity. I wish they had been wrong, but I’m in my 40’s and it still happens. It hurts. All they see is my long, curly, dark auburn hair, pale skin with an olive tinge, and golden-greenish brown eyes. They know I’m not all white, so I get asked a lot “what are you?” It gets old. \n\nAs for dating a trans MTF, I might if I were available. I’m not to keen on the other direction FTM. My preference outside of my husband is women. I’m bisexual or I guess Pansexual, but younger men are appealing to me because they like to have a good time and are just refreshing in their attitudes. However, I can’t have children and I would rather see a younger man marry someone who can give him that. \n\nAnd I personally believe that this is the greatest deterrent that men have when it comes to dating Transwomen. They can’t have fully biological children with a Transfemale. Also, Transwomen, you should bank your sperm never starting treatment. You might want a biological child of your own, especially if you’re into women or even men. The healthier and younger you are, the better the quality of your donation. You never know the future. A man’s sister might offer to carry for you and then that child would be more biological to you both. Also, your sister might carry for you and your partner and her child will be more biologically closer to you. Or you could both have children with the same surrogate. Lesbians usually have one child with a father and then the other parent has one too with the same father. The options are endless. It just takes timing and planning. \n\nLearn a lesson from me, please tell your partner your transgender after the second or third date. Watch their reaction closely and please do it in A private but public place. I’ve seen what real hatred looks like up close and personal. Do the right thing and own your truth please!! \n\nIf they leave, great because they’re not the one. You could even remain friends and possibly be introduced to a future spouse through an old flame, if no hanky panky ever went down. These things matter. Trust me. \n\nIt takes a lot of courage to own your authentic self. I could’ve passed as whiteish, (Spanish, French, Greek, Israeli, Irish because of my red hair, Lebanese, Italian etc…) Lord knows people will guess all kinds of things, but I didn’t. I owned all of myself and yes, I suffered but that only made me double down even harder on being true to my identity as a mixed race woman of Nigerian and Jewish ancestry. I’m also open about my sexuality if asked and I don’t believe in cheating. It’s the soul that attracts me to people and the most important criteria I use in selecting friends. Those I choose as friends are the people I share everything with. And literally, I do share all aspects of myself and they do with me too! We’re family! Lol!! Mutual respect and admiration are beautiful and something we all deserve to give and receive. \n\nDon’t be angry if someone tells you that they’re not comfortable with your trans-identity. It’s ok. By exiting with grace, and being authentic to yourself, you might one day be surprised if you get called up a year or two down the road from one of those suitors that wasn’t ready then but now is. Lots of love to everyone here today❤️❤️❤️🏳️‍🌈",

As if I was scared of the ridicule and opinions of others.\n\nIt would appear that you do in fact have a bias against trans women. It's clear from the wording in your post that although you acknowledge your attraction to trans women and acknowledge, at least partially, that trans women are women, you still have some sort of blockage in your thought process related to their trans identity that prevents you from interacting them the way you would any other woman.\n\nI'm not trying to admonish you for having that stance, I'm just observing that you may not be as unbiased as you think, and that part of changing your view/understanding trans issues requires you to be honest with the fact that you do hold biases and that it's ok to challenge them.\n\n>personally I don't ever want to sleep a person who used to be a man.\n\nWhy not? This part seems to be a pivotal point in your reasoning and I think it's worth exploring what it means that a trans woman \"used to be a man\", whether or not that statement holds for every trans women (I imagine most will not feel that they agree with it), and whether or not it's relevant to any present sexual encounter.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that a trans woman isn't a man, she's a woman. It seems as trivial as worrying about sleeping with someone because \"they used to be a child\" - it's irrelevant to the present.\n\n>Nothing against trans people but it's not for me. Unless it was Brittany Daniel from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\n\nIt's curious that even in a joking manner you acknowledge that there are in fact exceptions to your rule. If you are able to get over someone being trans mentally in a specific scenario, ask what it is about that particular instance that's different and why it can't be overcome in other scenarios.\n\n\\-----\n\nIn general I should emphasize that no one should be expected or forced to sleep with any other person without their explicit consent, but in matters of discriminating between partners it's worthwhile for everyone to acknowledge and examine their own biases in terms of picking who they're interested in. I think you owe it to trans people as someone who acknowledges they deserve better treatment to understand how your own view contributes to stigmatization, and how your held belief that \"you would feel ashamed\" holds back the community by not creating a space for normalizing the idea that trans women are who they say they are and that there's nothing \"wrong\" about a straight man hooking up with a woman.",

You don't have to justify your preferences to anyone. You get to announce to the world what your mind and body prefer and there's little we can  do about it.\n \nBut. \n\n1) There's no world in which a person can reliably infer another person's preferences or deal breakers. They may be able to infer a few of them there's no way expecting them to infer *all* of them near instantly is a reasonable expectation. If there are things that categorically would not want to happen, the onus is on you to disclose that.  The onus is on you to have as accurate and exhaustive a \"deal breaker\" list as you can muster. \n\n2) which brings me to my next argument. A preference is something you you have an penchant for. A deal breaker is something that comes to light that you do not want to be involved with and will walk away from. Both of those involve getting to know the other person and screening them. That is a process. It's an audit, the focus of which you put together through introspection, analysis, extrapolation and trial&error. If your screening process is leaving you feeling \"emotionally an mentally disturbed\" that's a sign that you're current screening questionaire is failing you... Not that the other person failed to give you a piece of information they couldn't deduce you needed. \n\n3) Quite frankly some emotional and mental anguish is just par for the course of dating. Having something happen to you and learning that you are categorically opposed to doing that again are part of the lessons you learn about yourself while you court potential partners. \n\nAnd that's just about preferences and deal breakers. It doesn't even cover miscommunications. What if \n\n- the transperson usually doesn't pass and so is just assuming you knew. Don't underestimate how gender dysphoria and body dysmorphia can skew your perception of your own body. \n\n- What if they thought you were trans and so assumed that it didn't need mentioning that they were. \n\n- what if there's an incongruence between you presenting yourself as wholely supportive of transpeople and in fact empowering of them but don't vocalize the \"but not in my back yard\" bit. \n\n> I but personally I don't ever want to sleep a person who used to be a man. \n\nThere's no way around this. If this is a big enough issue that you couldn't deal with the aftermath of it happening by accident or through miscommunication, then you need to look out for yourself once you are aware that that is the case for you.

The argument has definitely come up in court cases where someone was assaulted when a partner found out that their genitals did not match their stated gender. \n\nThis is a very difficult topic both within and outside of the queer community that we clearly can’t shut down with [shirts that say “I punch TERFS” ](https://www.feministcurrent.com/2018/05/01/trans-activism-become-centered-justifying-violence-women-time-allies-speak/) and by denying the exclusion of people born female (including transmen) from trans-activist rhetoric. \n\nThere have been intensely fraught [legal battles](https://www.canlii.org/en/commentary/doc/2018CanLIIDocs10555#!fragment/zoupio-_Tocpdf_bk_9/BQCwhgziBcwMYgK4DsDWszIQewE4BUBTADwBdoAvbRABwEtsBaAfX2zhoBMAzZgI1TMAnAEoANMmylCEAIqJCuAJ7QA5KrERCYXAnmKV6zdt0gAynlIAhFQCUAogBl7ANQCCAOQDC9saTB80KTsIiJAA) regarding gender fraud and whether non-disclosure is illegal and to what extent. \n\nIt doesn’t affect me as a pansexual, but is very disturbing on both sides for people who have been hurt by it. And I don’t know the answer. But I do know that excluding people born female from any community looks more like hegemonic control than activism, no matter what the excuse. \n\nIt is disgusting to expect a trans person to disclose a gender that absolutely does not apply to them. It is disgusting to say someone isn’t a proper lesbian if they prefer female genitals on a partner. It is disgusting to tell a straight man you are a woman and then, in the middle of a sex act, let him discover that you have male genitalia. It is also revolting to physically assault someone for being female and having a penis. \n\nMaking blanket laws that force either side of this would be detrimental, because it’s basically a teeter-totter where strong advocacy on one side directly negates the other. \n\nAnyone wishing to avoid this mousetrap entirely is met with conflicting messages: \n\nIt is: \n\n-YOUR job to find out if your partner is trans, since YOU are the one with the problem.\n-horrible and disgusting for you to ask another person what their gender is and what kind of genitals they possess\n\nSo far, we have failed to find a solution that isn’t unfairly biased and ultimately offensive to everyone. Trans people can also have a genital preference, and can also be offended when another person doesn’t disclose their gender. \n\nAnd honestly, is this such a typical experience that we even have to talk about it? I’ve seen it once. On a TV show (Nip/Tuck) that was, at the time, pressed for ratings. I’ve heard about it 5 or 6 times, from men who all had run ins with the same woman where I lived, who would troll bars looking for guys to bring home, sit on their chests and tell them to, quote, “suck my d*ck!”\n\nThat’s an assault, period. The person didn’t do that because she was trans. That’s not a thing trans women DO and it would be offensive to assume anyone would. Honestly making that kind of assumption, living in FEAR that someone would be trans and NOT TELL YOU *gasp* is paranoid as hell. \n\nTL;DR I’m tired of hearing about things that would never happen unless the person doing it was actually a complete psycho. They waste time that is needed for real advocacy and prioritize your feelings over the actual physical safety of people in the queer community.",
