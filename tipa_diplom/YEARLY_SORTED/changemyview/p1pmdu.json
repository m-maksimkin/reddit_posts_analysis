    "CMV: The story of Job proves that the judeo-christian god is not good\nIn the story of Job, the devil offers God a bet -- that God's most faithful follower, Job, would not curse him no matter what he did to him. God accepts this bet and gives the devil his explicit blessing to murder innocent children, servants, and livestock (among other things) to test Job's faith. When Job questions God's motive for ruining his life, and ending the lives of many close to him, he is merely scolded. Had God been honest and forthright, he would have told Job that his children were murdered simply to test his faith, and that this test was necessary only to win a bet with the devil. Furthermore, at the end of the story God tells Job's friends that were it not for Job's unflinching devotion to his tormentor he would have \"destroyed\" them.\n\nI posit that:\n\n1. \"Testing\" peoples' devotion to oneself is, itself, an abusive and manipulative behavior\n2. Threatening to \"destroy\" people for questioning one's motives (for committing heinous acts, no less) is abusive and manipulative\n3. Murdering innocent people is immoral. Especially when done to achieve trivial ends.\n\nPut simply, a manipulative, abusive, and murderous god is not a good god.\n\nPotential counter-arguments:\n\n* All that God did (or that the devil did on his behalf) was perfectly justified in this instance because the strengthening of Job and Job's friends' faiths is a greater good than would have been possible without murder, etc.\n\nGod's stated goal in this instance was not to strengthen anyone's faith, but to win a bet with the devil. All that transpired in the story was to serve that goal. Furthermore, God used manipulative and abusive tactics to achieve this result, and greater devotion to an immoral god surely cannot be a greater good than *not* murdering innocent people\n\n* The devil was going to torment Job, anyway, and God merely did not intervene (invoking the \"problem of evil\")\n\nThe text does not support this assertion. Job 1:6-1:12 and 2:1-2:7 are fairly clear that the devil proposes a bet and God accepts:\n\n>“'Does Job worship the Lord for no reason? 10 Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his cattle have increased in the land. † 11 **But stretch out Your hand and touch all he has, and see if he will bless You to Your face**.' 12 Then the Lord said to the devil, 'Behold, whatever he has I give into your hand; but do not touch him.'\"\n\nand\n\n>\"Then the **Lord said to the devil**, 'Have you considered my servant Job, since there is none like him on the earth: an innocent, true, blameless, and God-fearing man, and one who abstains from every evil thing? Moreover he still holds fast to his integrity, though **you told me to destroy his possessions without cause**.'”\n\nFurthermore, this would absolve God only of the \"tests\", not of his behavior later in the story.\n\n* God dictates morality\n\nWhy should anyone be interested in a morality that permits such heinous behavior? If God is real and evil, I think it would be preferable to deny him fealty.\n\n* God gave Job everything back in the end!\n\nPerhaps, though it still remains that Job's original children, servants, and livestock remain dead and murdered. They were denied justice, and \"testing\" faith remains abusive and manipulative, anyway.": [

Through all of this Job remains faithful to God, and defends himself against others who try to claim the suffering was due to some sin that Job committed.  \n\nTo respond to your specific posited points:\n\n1. God is not testing Job in this book as He already knows Job's faith and testing does not come from God as other scripture discusses.  \n\n2.  The wages of sin is death, to blame God for that would be similar to blaming the government for making laws.

You're not seriously going to challenge a deity, are you?\n\nThe conclusion of the Job story -- the poetic text, not the frame narrative, which is likely a later addition -- is basically this.  You can't seriously challenge God, so shut up and do as you're told.  God is powerful and inscrutable and you have no standing to argue against him.  This story is generally considered to be Exilic, so it would help the ancient Israelites deal with losing their homeland and being forced into Babylonia, to essentially keep their faith even though God clearly fucked them over.  It's a very different answer from that given by the narrative that ends in Kings, which is very clear about the cause of the Exile being overwhelming and constant idolatry and sin in general.  I think Job is the take that makes the most sense, since it takes a \"shit happens\" attitude, and, well, shit does, in fact, happen.  The Kings idea of moral justice is stupid and you should not expect it.\n\nThat said, the Job idea of a God that does not enforce moral justice is basically the fast track to atheism.  What's the point of having a God if he or she does not enforce moral justice, right?  If your actions don't matter, who cares what you do?  I'm guessing the ancient Israelites simply did not consider that possibility.",

The story should be interpreted with this in mind.\n\nGenerally, when approaching a parable, we ask the question, ‘What message(s) is the author intending to convey?’  Job is a story about dealing with suffering, loss, and the seeming unfairness of the world.  It discusses how we, as humans, handle living in a universe in which the basis for the Maker’s choices are unfathomable and unknowable.\n\nThe initial story between the deceiver and God is setup - an expedient way of getting to the point.  We should avoid investing it with more interpretive significance than it calls for.\n\nPutting aside the Job story, however, does leave us with the interesting question of divine morality - whether God’s actions are good.  It’s an exercise that becomes complicated in a hurry.  God is all-knowing and all-powerful.  He is capable of performing any action, while also knowing all the possible consequences of His actions.  That means that, when He acts, He sees all of the ‘butterfly effects’ of even the smallest intervention rippling through thousands of years of time - the deaths caused and prevented, children born or not, civilizations destroyed or set into motion, etc.\n\nI ultimately think it would be impossible for us to judge the moral status of such a being.  His knowledge and abilities are so far beyond mine that I could not reasonably presume to comprehend the moral calculus required.  \n\nI hope this perspective is helpful!\n\nEDIT:  Wow this blew up!!!

However, as is common, the most well-known way is that because it's *simplest*, not because it's the only way.\n\nThere are also other ways that some Christians approach the Bible. And this isn't limited to random lay people, but includes Biblical scholars and clergy. For example, you may think about the Bible as a record of stories that people have told about God, so it gives us insight into the history of beliefs and practices in our faith, without necessarily asserting that all those beliefs and practices were exactly what God wanted. This belief certainly means there's more room for variation in what you believe about God, but is not incompatible with being Christian. And the Bible can still be an important, sacred text, without having the same sorts of expectations applied to it.\n\nIn that light, it's best not to read Job as \"here is a thing that God did\", but as \"here is a story that people told each other to try to understand God\". And they are an *ancient* people. Job is the oldest book of the Bible. And so trying to understand the story is a deeply cross-cultural experience. You can't just read it as if it were something written by modern Christians and expect to get a good interpretation, any more than you could read Aristotle's works as if they were written by a modern academic and expect to get a good understanding of their significance.\n\nOne important cultural thing that shows up again and again in the Hebrew scriptures is that they attributed basically everything that happened to God. If it rained, it's because God sent the rain. If a person God sick, it's because God did that. If a person recovered, that was caused by God.\n\nSo the setup of Job, where God is doing bad things to a good person...that probably wasn't the point. That wasn't what the story was focusing on. That was just a known thing. Bad things sometimes happen to good people, and because God does everything, God clearly does that. Job is trying to explore the \"why\" of that.\n\nJob is an ancient response to the thing that religious people still struggle with all the time: \"why do bad things happen to good people?\" And yes, that question is a problem that religious people need to grapple with. But it's not incompatible with a loving God.",

But he couldn’t even recognize it because he kept all the bad stuff separate from himself in his mind. (Take all this however allegorically you want to ofc.) This shadow side of him, his sinister left eye, was “Satan”. \n\nAs “Satan” was bringing down God, so was he, in a way, bringing up Man in the garden of eden when he came as a snake and had our forbears eat that crazy fruit. It all comes full circle. A greattttttt big circle which btw is time or the book of life or the ouroboros or whatever ⭕️ \n\nGod was kind of battling with himself through Job and Job was a good guy through all that bullshit. God had some reckoning to do with himself after all that cause…. That was fucked up! And damned if I don’t think we are all Job. God owes US an apology if anything. Not vice versa like we are taught with the idea of original sin. Nah son. We were born beautiful perfect creatures, every one of us. It’s life that dirties us up and hides the light. \n\nJesus represented some kind of apology from God almost like “Holy shit guys! I messed up! This place is crazy! Here! I’ll come as literally the most holy, cool dude I can - and life will KILL HIM MOST CRUELLY. Worse than Job even eh! \n\nChrist kind of represents to me, like the first awake man. He was like “hey guys! I’m GOD! AND SO ARE YOU!” So yeah it was like god incarnated in this dude and then died viciously at the hand of his asleep brothers and sisters just to like experience it. Which is all life is ofc. God experiencing it all. God’s journey. God’s waking up. (It’s a pleasure to be talking with you big guy 😉)\n\nMary in the story is way bigger than she is given credit for by the modern tellings. She represents the mother who can see it all and love it all. She is the uniting fourth principle. It’s not a trinity. That was incomplete. It’s god. The shadow (which includes our shadows ofc) - in fact yeah let’s say that right now. ALL OF THIS MACROCOSM PLAYS OUT IN EACH ONE OF US. We are in the Garden as children. God is good. Life is good. Then the snake. We probably learn pain exists. We learn something that shadows or beatific vision. We are exiled from the garden. We are job. God is toying with us. That jerk! No no. Wait. The evil I see in the world- it’s in me. Fuck. What a sinner I am. Then. There is Grace. I can forgive myself for all the bad stuff. I can forgive the world. I can forgive God. Oh! I can love it all! And the beatific vision returns! But with a twinge of sadness that comes with wisdom. A mother’s love. An unbearable empathy and love for it all. \n\nSo anyways. The trinity. Yeah that’s god. His shadow. Jesus which is Christ consciousness in the microcosm of us. And Mary makes it a   q u a t e r n i t y. She is the all loving mother that incorporates it all. Something like that. Please folks chime in! \n\nThe “antichrist” will come as an answer to Jesus. Maybe he will be like Jesus but with knowledge of his shadow side. Maybe Jesus but like he’s seen some shit. In our microcosm, maybe it will be like the Christ consciousness entering us all. The great awakening. Why do we need a Jesus if we are all Christ? So maybe it’s not the end of the world like is predicted in John’s Revelation, but a transition from this world into a kind of heaven that we can make again for ourselves on this planet that was at one time, paradise. It still is if you can see it! If you can love it all like our momma. \n\nIdk 🤷‍♂️ \n\n😘",

All for worshipping \"God\" he received these things. \n\nNow Satan sees this dude and immediately is like, \"i bet if he was to lose all his blessings, he would totally not be down with serving his master, \"God\". \n\nSo, Satan is *allowed* into heaven to see the big G. He is kind of escorted there.\n\n \"God\" is all like, \"yo Satan, how's it going mu'man?\" They do a secret illuminati handshake and get on to business as usual. \n\nSatan: ive been walking the earth to and fro. And low and behold my eyes have seen Job. Whom you have blessed with prosperity. \nI wager...five bucks...that if you were to take away the things you have blessed him with, he'd prolly fuckin hate you or something. \n\n\"God\": *ponders for a bit* you sonofabitch, im in. \nYou can do whatever you like to Job, just dont kill him...sound good? AND lets make it interesting...*twenty* dollars. \n\nSatan: *scratches chin* (idk...last bet kinda put me below my budget. Ah fuck it. I git plans for Job that'll send him away from this clown) \n\nSatan: Bet... Twenty bucks it is.  Youre goin down, ya white bastard. \n\nGod: yeah whatever, suck my ass. Get back down there to the underside of my balls you call a kingdom. \n\nNow, right here we have the first, and maybe the only, account of \"God\" being literally *tempted* by \"Satan\". At this point, God wants to prove Satan wrong via a fucking bet for the soul of Job...and 20 dollars. Satan tempts God that he will lose a bet. A bet that an omniscient god would surely know he would win anyway.\n\n But yolo, right? Lets put a man through literal hell for some bet with the/a literal *devil*.  \n\nSo Satan goes back down to the earth, his kingdom. \nHe fuckin ruins Job.\n\n Causes an earthquake that kills his family during some nice meal featuring a mostly burnt sheep and some bread. With rice? Maybe. \n\nJob's livestock goes dead. \n\nSatan then us like: lol BOILS MOTHAFUCKA. \n\nAnd covers Job's flesh with legions and sores. \n\nEven Job's wife, a bitch of a woman, curses Job for remaining subservient to his \"God\". \n\nShe's like: you stupid micro penis-having old fuck. Your god doesnt love you. Look upon all this ruin. Youre god is doing this! \n\nShe then goes on to sleep around with everyone in the nearest village, just to spite Job...i guess.idk. \n\nTo fast forward and stuff. \n\nJob remains vigilant to thuh lawd and Satan sees this and is like. \n\nWell fuck...now i gotta break a fitty.\n\nSo after the bank, Satan goes back up to heaven and strikes a convo with the Big G. \n\nSatan: yo dude...i guess you were right about Job. Heres your fuckin money. \n\nGod: fuck yeah i was right, ya dumb biatch. Gimme that shiiiit. Now...you know what else imma do? Imma bless Job with shit 7 fold ya heeaaar? Lol. \n\n\nSo...Job...at his final days. Old and weary. Just wants to rest and be at peace after everything went to shit. Hes tired man. Hes at wits end. He barely wants to get out if bed in the morning. \n\nSo what does God do? \n\nGives this old as man a SHIT ton of livestock to attend. Bunches of kids to take care of. Acres of land to toil and plant. \n\nSo much work that could kill a man. \n\nPoor Job. \n\n\nFeelsbadman.",

Our traditional definition is based off the negative, that “bad” things happen must inherently mean there must be a “good” thing, and the dividing line tends to be our own perspective of what justice is.\n\nYour definition of “innocent” is also important here too. You claim that the lives that God allowed to be destroyed are innocent, but in a cosmic sense this isn’t true. Scripture calls all hearts depraved (Mark 7:21), dictates that all have sinned (Romans 3:23), and no one is good, no, not one (Psalm 14:3, later referenced in Romans 3:10-12). Based on a cosmic definition of innocence and guilt, it would seem present that no one is considered innocent under God’s eyes. From that perspective, that He leaves any of us alive is merciful, and His ultimate good was a death on the cross as atonement for the guilty.\n\nOther posters have indicated that Job is an allegorical story, but I tend to disagree. Regardless of whether it is or isn’t, the fact still remains that, if you assume an infinite God with infinite knowledge, he must be the progenitor of good, and anything apart from him must be inherently evil. Who developed humanity’s sense of good and evil? Was this something we developed as time developed, or were we given this by a Higher Being? The answer comes down to worldview, and regardless of the answer it must be come to by faith.\n\nBut if you assume that our sense of good and evil is defined by God, and that good is whatever lines up with His morality and evil is anything that opposes, He must then be inherently good and everything He does must be good. It’s up to us to change our definition of good to match the initiator of what good is.\n\nI encourage you to read [this article](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/who-causes-your-suffering) as it does a much better job of explaining “evil” in the context of Job.

From this we can see that the presence of pain in the world does not necessarily signify an uncaring God, just one who does not exclusively care about happiness or pleasure.

Job is a dialogue between representations of of Good and Evil. Like the Platonic dialogues, which are quite possibly theoretical in places, and composite discussions (which may have been exposited over years of lecturing and public discussions) compressed into simpler, singular dialogs. Just as it doesn’t really matter whether Thrasymachus actually got up in Socrates’ face, whether the exchange itself occurred isn’t the point, and the point of the story isn’t to make readers believe that it took place. Rabbinic, or alternately, Catholic, religious tradition is very instructive here. Referring to my previous analogy, it’s a little hard to start calling Plato a liar because he wrote a dialog which may or may not have actually occurred in order to contextualize the collected sayings of his teacher, Socrates. \n\n2. Setting aside the fact—which others have explicated in excruciating detail (that the Bible is essentially a collection of various genres of texts)—if anything, Job is a story of God’s refrain from acting. Indeed, God is downright passive through most of this story. You yourself quote the verse in which God says ‘All right, it’s your show. Just don’t touch the VIP.’ \n\n3. Here (as you note) we kind of get a look at the weaknesses of the “problem of evil” as a refutation of God, despite how vaunted it is. We hairless apes can’t comprehend the role of evil in the greater scheme of things, therefore God is naught. And a child doesn’t understand why the doctor has to hurt (by say, pricking her arm with a vaccination) in order to help. Consider that the gamut between human reason and God’s omniscience is infinitely wider than between an adult and a child. Yawn. \n\n4. Moreover, we see the redemptive value of suffering on full display in this story as well. This is a theme you’re going to see from start to finish when reading the Bible. It’s a very old idea.",

Whether or not he was a real person isn't really important, but the lesson seems to be about how small (small minded, small in power) people are compared to a God.  Job himself says \"the lord giveth and the lord taketh away, blessed be the name of the Lord\" in essence saying, nothing is actually *his* without blessing by God.  Further, in the book of Job, God directly shows up in a whirlwind or whatever and says where were you when I created the foundations of the earth?  Where were you when I created creatures you can't even imagine, also, in essence, saying something along the lines of, \"I am *God* and my ways are not within your understanding.\"  I am not saying I like it or enjoy the message myself, but I am merely pointing out that the morality of all the lives lost and pain endured is basically God saying, \"look how puny you are to me and I am on a different level beyond your reasoning\" and \"I can do all kinds of things beyond your reasoning and so what you think is important isn't really important.\"  I view it the same way with the morality and \"goodness\" of lives lost or suffering endured, like, God is saying, you think you know what good is?

One of the problems with analyzing God’s character is that our humanity and sinful thinking challenges our understanding. It is poor reasoning to “disqualify” God from a single example of (what appears to be) sin. Our poor understanding, our earthly perception, or our sinful worldview could be to blame for a wrong conclusion. \n\nYou are not wrong in your point on Job in the analysis that God was behind Job’s suffering. That is undeniable. As a preacher, people are offended when I say this, but the Bible makes this clear—like you showed. Therefore, we must begin the challenge of understanding whether God violated his own morality. As one Bible professor said to me, “Don’t let God off the hook.” It would be too easy, too shallow, and frankly wrong to say “God allowed it.” A police officer that allows a robbery he could have prevented is himself guilty. God would be too. \n\nThe only thing that would make sense for God to be pure good and still do what he did to Job is this, Job’s victory of faith is greater than the suffering he experienced. If the personal anguish of Job is greater than the value of his experience and growth then God would not be good. Once you accept that then God was not evil in doing so. \n\nAre you left with a distaste of God’s morality? God cannot be charged with evil because he is the standard of good. You can charge with a morality that you do not like though. \n\n(Assuming you understand that God exists and that the Bible inspired by God) If that is the case, that you do not care for God’s goodness, then you are left with two options: 1) reject God and accept the consequences he has warned you of or 2) accept that God is God and you are not in charge and he is. \n\nGod didn’t ask for your permission. God doesn’t need it. You don’t like how God treated Job? Well, that doesn’t change the fact that he’s God. The end of Job, God informs him of just this. The central message of Job is that you don’t get an answer for every question. Not having answers for questions doesn’t mean you can’t worship God. \n\nYou can look for every excuse to not worship God, but that probably just shows you that you didn’t want to worship him anyway. You can look at the book of Job and say, “He doesn’t look all-loving,” or you can look at the many many reasons in the Bible to show God’s goodness, righteousness, and love. The same God sent his Son to die for you. \n\nLike him or don’t, he’s still God and he’s still your judge.",

The devil is granted power in this world because the concept of free will requires there to be a choice.  It may be easier to think of it as simply dark and light,  existence as we know it requires both.\n\nI used to find it odd that god allowed jobs entire family to die and then he just gives him a new one at the end.  Taken literally it’s rather insane (and taking religion literally is insane) but in the figurative sense it represents that we can lose absolutely everything in this world but if we do not turn away from ‘the light’ we will never succumb to darkness.  \n\nAlso remember that job is considered gods ‘favorite’ and that is why the devil chooses him.  The devil basically asks permission to go after job with everything he’s got and god being god says ‘I know job he will never turn from me’ and it is the devil who is the fool to bet against god.  The devil as a character is essentially the one who is endlessly defiant and refuses to submit to the will of the divine, so the devil is always looking for a way to challenge gods authority.\n\nAll the actions taken against job are the work of the devil, but people make the mistake of attributing them to god because he is allowing it to take place.  If god created all things that would include the devil and make god responsible for the devil and all the suffering right? But god as creator allows his creation to function independently and to play a role in the story of creation/life ect…     So Why does god allow suffering to exist?  Because the alternative is incredibly boring for everybody, and if you’ve lived in this world long enough with half a brain you may see that recurring pain and struggle is preferable to a world without it.   A good life is one in which you experience highs and lows and a wealth of experiences, and in that sense ‘god’ is very good for allowing the devil, and anyone, to stand in opposition.  This is why any and all actions can be forgiven if you choose to accept forgiveness,  god has granted everything so why would god hold it against you for something he permitted?  And so eternity goes… for the devil being who the devil is will never accept forgiveness from god and god will never use his power to force the devil to do anything.

Either morality is objective, which means there must be an ultimate good (to have a \"better\", there must be a \"best\"), or morality is purely subjective.  If morality is purely subjective, then God did nothing wrong because \"wrong\" doesn't actually exist as anything more than personal like or dislike and matters about as much as someone's cereal preference.  If morality is objective, then as I stated above, there has to be an ultimate good.  If we agree that some things are objectively better, there must be an objectively best.  That would mean that objective morality comes from a higher power.  Call it what you will, but God seems to fit that bill pretty well.  \n\nSince you seem to be pretty solidly in the camp that thinks that there is real \"right\" and real \"wrong\", we'll continue along that line of thought.  Attempting to condemn God, the author of the morality that you are using to justify your argument, makes you just like Job, himself, actually.  He even says that when a good man dies, God laughs.  God's response is to show Job the vastness and the minutiae of the universe, pointing out that He knows it all and reigns over it all.  Job's understanding of things is like that of a flea on a dog's back.  What we perceive of things, even the things that are explained to us in the Bible, is infinitesimal.  God is more than any of us can ever hope to fully understand.  And if the almighty, all powerful, all knowing, everywhere at once being who made the trajectories of the galaxies in the heavens and who knows the number of feathers on a sparrow's back, who designed the fusion reactions in a star and who wrote the codes of morality on all of our hearts, does something that you don't understand, the fault is probably with you, not with God.  Even pretending to know better than a being that is the reason for time, space, and all the things that reside within them existing at all, is akin to a toddler throwing a tantrum because their parents won't let them stick a fork in an outlet.  \n\nThat's actually the whole point of Job, honestly.

Accordingly, concern over their individual lives is not part of the message of the story, and to make a moral complaint about it is to read it wrong. \n\nAlso, your moral opinions are not automatically good arguments against the moral integrity of the text. They are akin to saying “This story has broccoli in it and I dont like broccoli.” If you are going to prove that the Christian God is not good, you’ll first need to account for the lesson that the story of Job is teaching, and then explain how it is inconsistent with its own morality or violates some moral standard that WE share. \n\nYou’re correct that God did indeed intend to afflict Job by withdrawing protection, whether directly or not. You’re also correct that nobody’s faith was strengthened. There is no textual indication of any personal transformation.  At most, Job’s friends were told that they wrongly described God and to make atonement for that. \n\nJob is a story that aims to answer this question: why do seemingly good people suffer? Job is the case study to which different characters offer answers. Satan claims that Job is not really good, and the suffering will prove that. (He is shown to be wrong). Job’s friends insist to him that he is suffering because he has done something wrong, even if he doesnt know what it is, and that he needs to confess and ask forgiveness. They assert multiple times that God only afflicts people in order to punish the wicked. (They are expressly told at the end that they are wrong about God and to ask forgiveness). Job’s wife contends that God hates him and urges him to further provoke God in order to end his misery. In all of this, Job defends his innocence and refuses to curse God. After these events, however, the story gets tricky. I will abbreviate: Job ends up challenging the innocence of God for punishing him. Then God appears,  scolds him for his lack of humility, and convinces him that He is far more wise and powerful than Job in all of His doings. Job apologizes and agrees that he should trust God’s judgements without understanding them (that is a key moral lesson of the story). Since Job did pass God’s test by not cursing Him (and in fact, completely humbled himself “to His face” instead of cursing when God appeared), God restored him and blessed him more than before.

And what is the point of following God if you get hurt?\"  Wanting to prove Job's integrity, God agrees to Satan's terms and removes his protection.\n\nSo here are your points and my counterpoints:\n\n(1) \"Testing\" peoples' devotion to oneself is, itself, an abusive and manipulative behavior\n\nA. I explained the testing/bet thing above. But really, there was a big point that had to be made: Would someone only follow God if God spoils them? Do people follow God not because he's true, but because they're afraid of Him? Now God didn't want to do this. But Satan was the one who insisted. Also, Job never knew why this all happened to him, it was never explained to him. Similarly in our lives, we do not know the full extent of the \"rules\" Satan and God are playing by. The Judgement at the end will determine who's philosophy is correct and we will be able to see and understand every angle and motivation. \n\n(2) Threatening to \"destroy\" people for questioning one's motives (for committing heinous acts, no less) is abusive and manipulative\n\nB. I'm guessing this one is talking about Job's friends. Now they were good friends. At first. They got down on Job's level (ashes and silence) and mourned with him for days without a word. That was good. Their issue was after Job started saying \"woe is me.\" They started spewing all sorts of awful things. Basically \"you must have done something to deserve all this, just TELL US WHAT IT IS!\" I've only heard stories of people who got told this after a child of theirs died and that phrase makes my blood boil. It shifts the blame on the victim. It makes people think \"if only I was (better) (different) (more faithful).\" But for Job, it was the death of ALL his children, the loss of almost all his servants, plus the destruction if his livelihood. The sorrow he must have felt was immense. Not only that, but the friends saying \"you were punished because you sinned\" suggests that God will punish you every time you slip up. Now sure, there are direct interventions for sins at times when things get REAL BAD, but I really believe in both consequences to our actions and God \"removing his protection\" which allows Satan to attack. I've heard it like sin and God is like oil and water. They can't be mixed and they move away from each other. That's why God moves Himself away from a person in sin. Since Job's friends were misconstruing God's image, God was repremanding them.\n\n(3) Murdering innocent people is immoral. Especially when done to achieve trivial ends.\n\nC. I understand this one pretty well. We, as humans, see death as the end. Game over. When we kill, it's us taking away people's opportunity to do more in this life and is unfair. But we don't have control over life and death like God does. For God, death is just a pause, something he can reverse and exert control over. All it does is stop people from doing anything in this current life and they'll be brought to life again during Judgement time at the end. \nI don't believe He allowed the lives of Job's children or servants to be taken away by Satan on a whim either. Job's entire household knew of God. And although they didn't \"die in Christ,\" seeing how He wasn't even born yet, we are only responsible for the things we know in our lifetimes.( In Job's time, that would be knowing of God and other things available to him during his time period.)\n\nEdit: fotmatting and spelling",

            "text": "Your logic is fine, and as far as inquiries into Christian biblical allegories go, you're arguing along the lines of many who have come before. Yes, The Book of Job shows us that God is most certainly *not* Pure Goodness, and even kind of a dick.\n\nBut the other thing it shows us is the importance of translation and cultural tradition informing how we read, and what meanings we derive.\n\nChiefly -- the word \"Satan\" in the book of Job does not mean \"Satan\" the way you or I think of it. In Job, Satan isn't an individual, and is not Lucifer, and is not any of the Devils, or a demon. That's an invention of a much later time.\n\nThe Hebrew word *śāṭān* used in the story actually means \"adversary\" or \"accuser,\" and has nothing at all to do with \"The Devil.\" Satan = The Devil is a later Christian invention, and the Book of Job predates Christianity by some 400-700 years or so.\n\nSo whilst your analysis makes sense, it's based on a mis-translation (albeit the most widely known one), and the appropriation of the tale from one religion into another later religion.\n\nIn its original usage, in the context of the Book of Job itself, some\"one\" stands in judgement (in accusation/in opposition) of Job and all that Job has made in his life. In a Judaic understanding, this accuser/opposer is not necessarily one person, but a sort of cultural amalgamation of those who are not Jewish and resist The Truth of The One God.\n\nSo it is better understood that \"Satan\" in Job is a bunch of envious non-Hebrews, standing in judgement of Job's success (who is a bit preachy), and arguing that if Job wasn't so successful then he wouldn't believe in this God fellow *either*.\n\nSo, there's a wager. And, importantly, it's not between Good versus Evil, God versus Devil -- it's between God and His Creation, the thing the humans live within. The wager is between The Divine and *The Natural*.\n\nSo that's the first major translation issue that impacts your argument.\n\nThe next issue is the conclusion.\n\nAfter everything, and Job is like, \"Yo God, what gives?,\" God goes on a tear, basically a narcissistic rage tangent for a while. Job tries to interrupt and is roundly ignored.\n\nThe ending of Job in the post-Christian English translations are pretty tidied up. In English, Job is like \"You're right, God. I repent. You're good, even though everything else is crap.\" And, like you're saying, basically gives in to his abuser. The message is clear -- God has *total* dominion, nothing you can do about it, might as well give up, and you must have faith in God regardless of anything that might happen, no matter how much the challenges of your life might challenge your faith. All in all, you're just another brick in the wall -- but you *must* be part of the wall.\n\nIn the original language, though, Job is more like, \"Well fuck me, this sucks. I feel sorry for us all.\"\n\nPre-Christianity, the story ended not with Job supplicating himself before the awesome power of God. Instead, it's a sober recognition that life is basically a series of miseries, and we will all live to regret having ever been born, because this world God set up is insanely hard and cruel. *And there's nothing you can do about it.*\n\nIt's a decidedly more Jewish ending -- there's no moral suggestion that God is Pure Goodness. This is the Old Testament God, who sets up traps for his own creations (the apple), denies knowledge, murders the whole world, eye for an eye, etc... Your option is *acceptance*, and that's it.\n\nThe Christian ending is the one that ends with supplication and some concession to the Enduring Goodness of God -- and, as a result, creates a theological contradiction where the Agent of Pure Goodness is, in fact, *also* the Agent of Pure Evilness.\n\nSo... your view is correct, but only insofar as it is based on a widespread misunderstanding of the story, based on two millennia of very deliberate appropriation of the story.\n\nHere's a great article about a newer and more accurate translation of the Book of Job, and its effect on how we understand the story: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/job-edward-l-greenstein/594769/\n\nEDIT: in light of the reply accusing me of distorting all known scholarship on this issue, here is another good (while slightly different) take: https://www.haaretz.com/archaeology/.premium.MAGAZINE-do-jews-believe-in-the-devil-1.6588731",

You have blessed the work of his hands, and his cattle have increased in the land.\"  The Satan then asks God to reach out and strike down Job but that is not how God works.  Instead he removes his hand of protection and allows Job to be afflicted by the Satan.  So in this story we do not see God inflicting suffering on Job but rather God removing his hand of protection from Job and allowing the evil and chaos of the world to impact Job and his household in a way that he had chosen to protect him from in the past.  \n\nAlso, it is not God's stated goal to win a bet a with the Satan.

Alongside Ecclesiastes I think it works as a standalone philosophical text that would be well worth studying as an ancient examination of profound questions that remain very relevant today: the problem of pain in Job (or \"why do bad things happen to good people\") and the question of meaning and futility in Ecclesiastes.\n\nI think /u/merlinus12 is making most of the arguments I would have wanted to advance, and better than I could, so I would raise another question instead. You describe the God of Job as immoral. On what basis do you make that judgment? If there is no transcendent God, who else would have the authority to establish an absolute reference point for what is moral? We're left with purely relative moral judgments, based on our feelings and culture, but without any grounds to say to someone outside our culture (such as, say, God) \"what you are doing is wrong\". You need to borrow God's morality in order to judge him with it.\n\nThis is a very old question. As stated by Hume (variously described as \"Hume's guillotine\" or the \"[is-ought problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-ought_problem)\"), you can't get from statements about what is (the job of science, broadly) to statements about what ought to be (i.e., moral judgments), unless of course you admit a God with the authority to make moral pronouncements. Nietzche also was very clear about the implications of \"killing\" God: \n\n> When one gives up the Christian faith, one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one's feet. This morality is by no means self-evident...Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole.\n\nIf you don't believe in a God, after all, then our sense of morality must simply be an evolved, adaptive trait like all of our other inherent drives and urges, and we have no reason to consider our moral sense as binding over our other urges. C.S. Lewis famously wrestled with this in his atheism as he found himself angry at God for what Lewis saw as His moral failures and saw that as proof that there cannot be a God, but he realized that he had to allow the existence of God in order to have any grounds to accuse Him. It's a case that's been laid out more recently as well: I love to refer to [this great piece](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2724&context=dlj) for the Duke Law Journal by an atheist law professor on the impossibility of absolute moral judgments without reference to God.\n\nSo, let's say we do allow the existence of God, and accuse Him of breaking His own purported rules. Job's friends say, foolishly, that Job can only be suffering because he sinned grievously against God, so his suffering must be merited. They have a very small view of a God who fits into their box. Job insists on his innocence and wishes to be able to present his case to God, to get an answer for why he has been so severely afflicted when he has always lived a righteous life. He comes off better than his friends. He doesn't accuse God, but he does demand an answer, to have this discrepancy explained. In the end, he gets what he wants: God appears, and says, in effect:\n\n> [For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways. As the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2055%3A8-9&version=ESV)\n\n> [Be still, and know that I am God.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2046%3A10&version=ESV) \n\nThe message of Job is one of humility before a transcendent and infinite God, and a warning against thinking that we might know better than him what is right or best. If you don't already believe in such a God this would certainly be a hard pill to swallow. Why trust in such a God? The answer is only intimated in Job, but the Christian view is that ultimately we can have faith that God is good and just because He himself in the person of Jesus Christ was subjected to unspeakable suffering and affliction - though He truly was blameless (unlike Job) - and that He did so for our sake: perfect love and perfect justice meeting at the cross. Job himself prophetically anticipates this in some way, as he says:\n\n>[For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth.](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2019%3A25-27&version=ESV)\n\nTo sum up, my question for you would be, on what grounds can you stand to accuse God of evil? And if you do accept that the only possible absolute standard for morality is God, then Job calls you to humility in the face of a God you cannot put neatly into a box, while the rest of the Bible, culminating in the Gospels, lays out why you can nonetheless trust a God you cannot hope to understand.",

We are filled with sin, imperfect, and unworthy to enter Heaven. \n\nAnd when we are particularly bad we rightfully get punished with a giant flood or a plague. A lot of people see the Old Testament as God being kind of a dick, but the Bible teaches that it is justified.   Of course, this kind of sets up for why Jesus was so important, because He sacrificed himself to forgive us of our sins forever. \n\nBut also, I think it’s also important to remember that God granted us free will. We can’t really fully understand Gods relationship with us, but I imagine Him as a strict father. A strict father punishes his child not out of cruelty, but to teach lessons. Fathers do test their children, they let them fail, and they don’t always stop bad things from happening. We wouldn’t say that this father doesn’t love his child. But they never give you more than you can handle. That’s part of learning and growing. I think a lot of people hear “God is good” or “God is benevolent” and think that means he is always nice and kind like an overprotective helicopter parent that coddles their kid. But I don’t think this image of a perfectly “kind” God is really compatible with free will… if God just prevented all bad things from happening then that is like being locked in a padded room- you may be safe but not free.

They ask if God is actually a just God and if he is, does he run the universe in the strict principle of justice? Because if the answers to those two questions are yes, then how do we explain Jobs suffering? Most Jews and Christians would say God is Just. He does run the universe strictly on the principle of justice -but justice is more than good people always receiving blessings and bad always receiving punishment. This is precisely the point that Elihu (Jobs friend) makes. \r  \n\r  \nJob is the culmination of the wisdom literature. Its wonderful when read with psalms and Ecclesiastes. Psalms says the world is ordered, predictable, and you reap what you sow. Justice can be found. Ecclesiastes says things are meaningless as one can work hard and not reap what they sow. There is great injustice in the world. These aren't contradictory but complementary. Job is grouped with these other books as the culmination of the world as it is. I think that helps consider the story, and Gods actions in the story of Job initially.\r  \n\r  \nTest/Manipulation: The purpose of the book of Job itself posits that Jobs life is not simply a test but an outline. Through countless centuries Jobs life has been revered as an example of how we live with a faith in the face of suffering. This is how we ought to live. I would point further to many examples of Old and New Testament where the faithful rejoiced for the opportunity to suffer to make Gods points for him, so that groups, nations, and the world itself would be better off. They didn't know what they were going through at the time, but that's certainly what happened. Daniel is another good example.\r  \n\r  \nQuestioning: Happy to edit this if you clarify for me. I don't see God threatening to destroy Job. God contrasts his immeasurable power and Jobs lack of power to make the ultimate purpose of the book. He could explain the conversation with satan but he doesn't. He says, this is how powerful I am and this is the universe I created. Job, do you even begin to notice the detail or the grand scale of all I've created? No? Then who are you to question me as my actions and purposes which span the entirety of creation. Job, you won't understand what I've done for the reasons I've done it. You're free to say \"Well that seems like a cop-out\" but God isn't concerned with it because if Job couldn't see it, why do we think we could?\r  \n\r  \nMurder/ Trivial ends (going to split these up.)\r  \n\r  \nTrivial ends: You don't and can't know what Gods ends are. Thats the same thought he gives Job. Gods explanation is that he has far greater plans and purpose for Jobs suffering that Job can't grasp with his limited view and understanding of the universe.\r  \n\r  \nMurder and Authority. What belongs to God? God the owner and creator of all gives to Job. The Judeo-Christian understanding is always that all we have and are belongs to God, and he may take it away whenever he so chooses. That includes our life. I think you forget the main crux of religious though, this isn't the end. If God chooses to remove us from this life and transfer us to the next, he has the authority and power to do so (being the Creator). This isn't murder. Murder is the unjust taking of innocent human life. Life and the authority to take it doesn't belong to you or me. Its illegal for me to levy taxes as I don't have the authority to do so, but not for the IRS.\r  \n\r  \nLot of words, very little editing so I expect you have questions or I've misspelled things . Happy to clarify, correct, or reword anything you might find confusing, unhelpful, or misguided.",

I have uttered things I did not understand. Things that were too wonderful for me to understand. \n\nThirdly God is angry at Jobs friends because they are lying about and mischaracterizing God which is clearly stated in 42:7.

That the Hebrew people were special, created by and looked after by this one god that was also special and more powerful than the others. This god was not particularly nice or good. He was more than willing to punish the shit out of his followers if they didnt obey him, and happy as a clam to lay the smack down on those outside the tribe of his creation when he felt like it. The god of the Hebrews is/was a tribal god interested in 1. the success of his tribe over other tribes and 2. that he be worshipped appropriately by the members of the tribe. This is not a criticism of Judaism; basically all gods in history have been this way.\n\n  \nThe story of Job is old enough that it is appropriate to read in the above context. In that context, the story makes sense. It stops making sense when we apply our modern sensibilities and interpretations to it. Most modern Jews/Christians/Muslims proport to believe in an all-knowing, all-loving and just god who created ALL of humanity in his image and wants nothing more than to guide us through a good life and into an eternal afterlife of bliss.\n\n  \nThat modern idea of God has little basis in the NT, and no basis whatsoever in the OT. So when you read the Story of Job (and others) it is hard to reconcile.",

Rather it is a non-historical story (literally beginning with the Hebrew equivalent of ‘once upon a time’) which displays several competing views of God and the moral universe from a HUMAN perspective (See Carol Newsom’s Job: A contest of Moral Imagination). Each of the three friends, Job, Eliphaz, and God argue for different opinions which were popular at the time. Second, chapters 1-2 and 42 are widely believed to be remnants of a story common to the ancient near east, as we see parallel Babylonian and Aramaic stories. Third, the “devil” is not the red-horned fellow you are likely familiar with from popular culture. The ‘Satan’ here is simply a transliteration of the Hebrew sataan which translates to ‘accuser’ (something like a prosecuting attorney). Most scholars agree that the character here is a member of the heavenly court, and not an evil being. Finally, the story is merely a setup for which allows the discussion of morality, not a story to be taken literally. Put another way, Job takes an existing “what if” scenario and develops it into a highly sophisticated presentation of competing ideas about morality. None are given preference over another (even God’s). All that to say, the book of Job doesn’t prove anything about anyone, it expands on several different moral theologies and philosophies in the ANE.

Is it reasonable to think that a God entity would have the same notion of morality? And obvious retort might be that God created us in His image, and that should extend to notions of morality, but does that stand to reason? \"Image\" could literally mean physical form (which begs the question of whether God has physical form, but let's leave that alone for our purposes here).\n\nTake, for example, your proposition that \"murdering\" \"innocent\" people is wrong. The word \"murder\" presupposes evil intent. Most people would agree that works for humans, but does it for God? He created us, can he not morally destroy us? If you create a logo guy and then destroy it, did you do anything wrong? Ah, but we have \"life\" and \"free will\" and all that where lego-man does not, right? But might God view those as no more important than, say, the way we view the light shining off lego-man? If so, wouldn't He have no less moral problem with destroying you as you do destroying lego-man? \n\nThe word \"innocent\" is another moral word. What does it mean? Hell, we can't even say for sure when it comes to people, let alone what it means to the creator. For all we know, he only killed creatures that He viewed expressly as NOT innocent in some way we don't comprehend. It would be a lot harder to say He is \"not good\" if that's the case.\n\nTL;DR The whole premise ascribing moral qualities to the actions of an omnipotent and omniscient creating entity is practically nonsensical as by definition we can never know the proper criteria to base such judgements on, nor is ascribing our own moral code to that entity any more rational. There's no reasonable basis for thinking that being is beholden to the same code we are, and His actions might be completely right, proper, correct and moral according to whatever code He follows.",

If you have any experience with ethics and ethical frameworks that should be enough to convince you that \"good\" depends solely on the framework that you are working from.\n\nNow in the context of God. I define \"good\" to be God's will. Surely you recognize that there are grey areas between \"good\" and \"bad\" even within a consistent framework. If I believe that God's will is \"good\", then I'd argue Job has a purpose in existing in the Bible and as a reminder of the power of God's sovereignty. Job's life sucked, and his family and servants and all that, but God had a plan for them, it was carried out, and it led to an illustration that would be used for millions if not billions of people down the road as an honest look into God's character. I would call that \"good\".\n\nIf you want to argue \"good\" is \"fair\", then sure, in terms of human values what happened to Job wasn't \"fair\" and it caused a lot of suffering which you might also characterize as not \"good\".\n\nAll I'm trying to get at is that \"good\" isn't objective - it's based on core foundational beliefs people have, and if I believe that God is all-knowing, all-powerful, perfect, and His plan exceeds my knowledge, what he does simply is \"good\" (also in my worldview suffering exists as a result of free will, an inherently \"good\" thing as well that is possible to be used for \"bad\"). If that doesn't convince you, fine. Just realize that in context of the Bible, Christians have fundamentally different beliefs than you do, and that for us, the idea of looking at the narrative of humanity as a whole and every single little thing that happens to us on the daily as affecting some larger, perfect, \"good\" plan is what gives us the sense that God is \"good\" and what happened to Job was also \"good\".",

Adam and Eve were created with eternal life, and free will, and were the parents of all Humans. God gave Adam and Eve one commandment, to not eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, lest they die. Adam and Eve listened to the serpent, and disobeyed god by eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Thereby condemning themselves to death. It is only due to God's mercy that he didn't kill all of humanity right then.  \n  \nJob is an in depth study on that idea. The point of Job is that we can't judge God, because God is the author of creation, and the source of Good. Most of the book is giving reasons for the reader to judge God. But with the whole picture, Job's eyes are opened, and he understands that the horrible things that happened to are the consequences of Humanity's original sin, and God had been holding the devil back from running around and doing this to everyone, even though death was the rightful penalty for all.\n\nThis may not be a great analogy, but say you build a robot with free will. Do you have the right to give it a commandment? And if it breaks that commandment, do you have the right to tear it apart? Maybe start from scratch and rebuild something better?\n  \nJust as the beginning of the story is important to understand, so also is the end of the story. And it answers your last critique. God became flesh, and dwelt among us as Jesus. When Jesus died, he went to Hades, or Abrahams bosom, which is where the spirits of Job and his family were waiting, and brought them up to heaven to be with God. He then rose from the dead to show that the penalty of death had been paid. And then he ascended to reign over the earth as King of Kings, and the devil was deposed of the authority that he had gained through the fall. And now spirits wait in heaven or hades, awaiting the resurrection, the judgement and the new heavens and new earth which will not be tainted by sin. And so, in the new earth Job, and his first family, and his later family will all be reunited in a world without evil.",

You've faced particular pain and suffering but have not by any stretch of the imagination seen the deep pit mankind can stoop to in it's depravity. You are capable, at best, of small moments of self-control which can be disrupted by a particularly strong emotion or whim. And you are challenging a person on the cosmic eternal scale. What standard are you bringing to the table to contest His standard? \n\nYou said, \"God's stated goal in this instance was not to strengthen anyone's faith, but to win a bet with the devil.\" \n\nBut you've missed the point of this book. This book is not about relationship between God and the devil. It is about the relationship between Job a finite created being and his infinite Creator. God draws the attention of the devil (a malevolent antagonist) to Job who is the paragon of morality on earth. Job loses everything. And the devil leaves the scene All that he was given by His creator was torn away and for what purpose. So that he could see that NOTHING raises man to the level of God. If the purpose of the book was to show God beating the devil then there ought to be a conclusion that shows exactly that. If you want to find the real purpose of the book I would recommend reading chapters 40 to the end. \n\nThe conclusion is that God is good because he is sovereign and Holy (holy is the shemitic concept of elevated otherness. It means that God is so far beyond His creation that His motivations, plans, thoughts etc cannot be inferred by created beings.) That means that the only way men can understand him is to shut up and listen (and history attests that we are as bad at that purpose as everything else). He has to reveal himself for us to even comprehend any nuance of his nature. \n\nAn example that can be drawn from daily life could be this. Imagine a family with an excellent relationship. A dad who loves his kids. And kids who love and trust their dad. They know each other as well as anyone can. The dad gives one of his very good kids an iPad out of his own kindness. An idea begins to form in the kid who got the iPad and those around him that maybe he deserves it. Maybe better people just deserve better stuff. The dad wants him to understand that such an idea is incorrect. So he takes away the gift he gave (and has every right to) and lets the kid stew and whine until the moment he chooses to explain. This all might look haphazard, arbitrary, and unfair to the kid but we've already established that the kid doesn't understand perfectly.\n\nI respect your reasoning but I think you are operating from some flawed foundations about the nature of the book and the source of morality. I'd be curious about your response to a modified heading. Rather than saying :The story of Job proves that the judeo-christian god is not good,\" I think it is more accurate to say \"The story of Job proves that the judeo-christian god is not *nice\"* . To which I say, He makes the rules. He doesn't have to be nice. Any kindness that He chooses to show is His own perogative. (I do believe that God is good but the concept of goodness is much deeper than just doing nice things).",

That’s the whole point of being God. If God says “this is good” then it is no different than God saying “this is a rock”. It’s simply a fact. Now does this mean that God can change morality on a whim? There’s a lot of debate on this on whether God creates good so He can decide what it means, God IS good so He can’t NOT be good and therefore He is consistent.\n\nBut going back to your original point, does it matter if you’re interested in it? In the same way that a rock exists, you can not be interested in it but it doesn’t make it untrue or not exist. I think a better way to phrase this and what you are alluding to is “How can this approach be moral? I do not believe it is and thus it would be better to rebel against the creator because He is evil”. \n\nThis issue is demonstrated in the book of Genesis when Abraham pleads for Sodom \n\n>“Then Abraham approached him and said: “Will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked? What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it? Far be it from you to do such a thing—to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. Far be it from you! Will not the **Judge** of all the earth **do right?**” The Lord said, “If I find fifty righteous people in the city of Sodom, I will spare the whole place for their sake.””\n>‭Genesis‬ ‭18:23-26‬ ‭NIV\n \nThis goes on several iterations until eventually God declares, “For the sake of ten, I will not destroy it.”\n-‭‭Genesis‬ ‭18:32‬ ‭NIV‬‬\n\nThis is not to say God would have destroyed it if only 9 could be found. It demonstrates that God does not smite the righteous with the wicked.\n\nThis answers several problems we have, bolded above\n\n1. God is to be a fair judge. He is consistent in that the wicked receive punishment and the righteous do not\n2. God does right in his judgement\n\nSo why do bad things happen to innocent people? Well none are really righteous. The rules are stacked against us. This can be demonstrated in both the Old and New Testament. \n\n“The Lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart: “Never again will I curse the ground because of humans, even though **every inclination of the human heart is evil** from childhood. And never again will I destroy all living creatures, as I have done.”\n-‭‭Genesis‬ ‭8:21‬ ‭NIV‬‬\n\n\n“for **all have sinned** and fall short of the glory of God,”\n-‭‭Romans‬ ‭3:23‬ ‭NIV‬‬\n\nSo was Job innocent? Not to God. Were his children ever innocent? Not to God. Does it look like that to us? Absolutely. That also demonstrates another issue, that we are EXTREMELY constrained in our ability to see moral issues compared to an all knowing being and things which may seem evil to us may be perfectly moral to God\n\nNow maybe you don’t buy this. Maybe you see some part of this and go “I don’t think that’s how it works”, which fair enough, it is called faith for a reason and ultimately I can never prove it to you. That being said this should be enough to demonstrate that you can have a “morally good” God even though the story of Job looks evil to us.",

            "text": "Job was one of the hardest parts for me to align with the concept of a “just and loving God” as well.  After years of thinking about it, here’s what I have found.\n\nFirst, your premise that it’s a “bet” is a popular one, but is not found in the actual text.  If it were a “bet”, that would indicate that Satan owns something that God does not, and that God wants.  While this is somewhat true (I’ll explain at the end), the text doesn’t indicate that at all.\n\nSecondly, we have to remove death as a meaningful issue from our understanding of the passage.  Children are afraid of the dark not because of what is there, but because they don’t know what *might* be there.  As adults, we know there are no monsters under the bed, and we act accordingly. \n\nSimilarly, God knows what is on the other side of death, and although we (like children) are afraid of the unknown, He knows there is nothing to be afraid of.  This makes it less about “murdering” the servants, et al., and more about their deaths serving a greater good (again, more below).\n\nWith these two basic premises covered, we can re-read the story of Job and produce a different understanding.\n\nIt is the story of Satan challenging humanity’s ability to exhibit true unconditional love for God in the same way that He loves us.  If God can love us even when we turn our backs on Him and can forgive us immediately when we repent (see the Parable of the Prodigal Son for more info), can we do the same for God when we feel that He has turned His back on us?\n\nIf we are in fact “made in His image”, then it’s Satan challenging the very basis of God’s creation, and God’s favor for all of us.\n\nThose stakes are quite high.\n\nFirst Satan takes Job’s “stuff” (including people, and yes that’s a sketchy part of the time period), but he still wasn’t convinced.  Then he attacks his own body, and ultimately his reputation.  After losing literally everything except his life, Job questions God’s plan, but never disavows Him.   \n\nThere is no text of the conversation between God and Satan at this point, but I think it’s clear that Job proved for all of humanity that we are in fact capable of unconditional love for God as well as for each other and that we are in fact created in His image.  \n\nFinally, we may ask “why would God care what Satan thinks?”, and this would be an excellent question.  My belief is that God is perfect love, and as such even loves Satan despite his sin, much like He loves us despite ours.\n\nJob is the story of God trying to show Satan the error of his ways, get him to turn away from his sin and his animosity towards humanity, and create a more peaceful universe for all of us.  Job succeeded in his role, but Satan continued on his path regardless.",

When you view humanity in this way, it massively changes how you view the actions of God. Every breath of life is a mercy, another chance to find salvation. With this in mind, we can actually see Job better.\n\nAll the things that happen to Job are technically not undeserved. Of deaths DJ Hell is the base deserved state of sinful man, then the children that died, the calamity that befell Job, and everything else, is totally justified. So this alone changes how you view the book. Job is no longer an innocent man being toyed with by a vengeful and merciless God, but a man called to have faith that God still loved him and would execute a perfect plan despite all these bad things happening.\n\nBut that’s not near everything, because the book itself addresses this. At several points, specifically chapter 9, Job calls God to the witness stand. He accuses God of being unloving and vengeful. He never says that God is wrong or unjust, because he knows that God wouldn’t be, but he demands that God explain how His promise to save mankind will work. He asks for a mediator to go between God and man, but ultimately says that this will never happen because God isn’t loving and merciful like He says He is.\n\nThen, in Job 38-41, God speaks to Job through a whirlwind and goes on for some time about how powerful He is and how much greater than Job He is. This may seem prideful or angry on the outside, but Job understood. God wasn’t saying “shut up, idiot, I’m cooler.” He was saying “Remember who I am. I created everything. You think your salvation and justification is beyond me? You can’t even fathom my ways. Be quiet, be patient, and trust me. I will save you.”\n\nJob was a man yearning for justification before God. He knew that he ultimately deserved all these things and worse, but he longed for a removal of his sins and for a perfect advocate, yet he couldn’t see that being possible. However, he knew that salvation was the only way that these things would eventually stop and that he would be justified and get what he most desired. God asked Job to trust Him, and so he did. \n\nJob was actually the earliest written book of the Bible. It was the story that focuses on the thing that the Bible wants every person to have: Faith. When you look at Job, you see a sinful man getting a portion of suffering that he technically deserves but longing for more. When he cries out in anger and doubt, God says “My ways are so much greater than you can imagine. Trust me.” Then you have the start of Genesis and the rest of the redemptive story saying “here’s why.”",

            "text": "The reality is what you are saying is not something I would agree with. \n\nGod gave man dominion of the earth and Adam gave it away to Satan.   Adam even knew the consequence of his behavior.  For God to just take dominion away from Satan right away is to have strings attached to the gift.  I've often been attacked by atheists who claim that having strings attached is wrong so having God taking control of the earth right away would be wrong according to atheists.\n\nI disagree with the idea that the discussion with God and Satan is a bet.  Modern versions have God and Satan betting a dollar which is not in the story because people slander God by adding the dollar or making it out to be a bet which means their non Biblical version is a lie.  I don't see it as a bet.  I see it as a test and a chance for Satan to see that God is right.\n\nGod did not murder people in the story of Job.  Satan did.  I'm going to remind you there is a difference between murder and killing.  All murder is killing but not all killing is murder.\n\n\"Perhaps, though it still remains that Job's original children, servants, and livestock remain dead and murdered....\"\n\nDid you read Job 42:10-11 where God gives back to Job twice as much as Job had before?  And verse 11 says, \"Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before....\"  Apparently God is good because Job got everyone back.\n\nTo answer your question, \"Why should anyone be interested in a morality that permits such heinous behavior? \"\n\nFor God to put away the evil, God wouldn't have to give us a chance.  In other words, I've hurt people, I've done wrong, I've made mistakes.  For God to put away all of the evil, I wouldn't have a chance.  But because God is good, God gives me a chance or God would have to destroy you and me.  If God is to judge sin then He would have to destroy me just like He would have to destroy the devil but because God is good, He will one day put away all of the evil.  Since God is good, I have a chance to turn to Him just like you and everyone else has a chance to turn to Him and you will have a chance to determine whether you want to be part of the group that is put away or not.  You are blaming God for what Satan did but it was Adam that gave Satan dominion because 2 Corinthians 4:4 calls Satan the God of this world.  And do you suppose that not allowing the evil to happen would mean that evil doesn't exist?  Without free will, Eve could ask Adam, \"Do you love me?\" and Adam would say, \"Who else?\"  For you to be free, there has to be a choice and for there to be good, there almost has to be evil or there is nothing to prove its good.\n\nA morality that doesn't permit heinous behavior would be God judging me along with Satan while I was still a sinner, not giving me a chance and putting me in hell which is the alternative.\n\nThese \"proof\" posts don't prove anything to me except that I have wisdom on the Biblical text.  I still believe God is good and no one has changed me.  The post is basically a strawman argument.",

So long in fact that he impregnated his wife's handmaid in desperation (the product of this union was Ishmael, who would go on to father his own legacy- the Arab race).  But only after Ishmael's father raised him to rule- then rejected him for his miracle heir, Isaac.  Still, God tested Abraham- demanding Isaac's life as a human sacrifice.  Only when Abraham moves to strike does God allow an angel to intervene.  He was midkill, and Isaac knew it.  Can you imagine his horror at that?  Then having to go home and live with him knowing he'd tried to ice you because 'God' told him to?\n\nPersonally I think 'God' is an antiquated term for technologically superior alien lifeforms.  There's a lot of evidence for this, both in archeology and religious texts themselves.  The descriptions of God and angelic interactions read like technology described by the technologically unaware.  Many books have been written on the subject, but my (still favorite!) introduction to the topic was Fingerprints of the Gods by Graham Hancock.  If you understand it from this perspective, all these interactions are more reasonable in a way- various bored aliens playing 'God' with their genetic experiments.",

He damaged the relationship of god and job and god never addresses this. The idea that God is all knowing means that God knew how this would turn out, but he can't. He gave man the one thing he never gave any other creature or angel, free will. He literally could not 100% know what job would do. This was gods gamble and job lost. God stood to lose nothing. The devil, the deceiver, had nothing to gain other than to know God would forsake man for his own glory. Shouldn't god have known the devil was doing this for this reason. If we accept that this was not a factual story, then we accept that this is simply a warning. Let god destroy everything you have and love at gods whim and continue to praise God, or suffer.

            "text": "You've got many misconceptions. First being what the Book of Job is. Job is not a literal recording of history, and never was meant to be that. In fact, most documents of this time weren't so interested in recording specific facts, as they were more interested in recording the story. You have to know that in this time they did not write down their history, they told it by tales, which is why you have both Written & Oral Torah (Torah being most of the Old Testament where Job comes from). With that in mind you have to understand that the Book of Job is what is referred to as a wisdom text, and the point is to inform the people who hear (and now read) the story of wisdom from God.\n\nAnother thing we need to address is that Satan -- actually \"Ha-Satan\" (The Accuser) a title -- is not the same thing that you would imagine today in the Western mind when you say the Devil, Lucifer, Beezlebud, or Satan. That whole idea hadn't been developed yet, and there's significant differences in what say a modern non-academic Protestant in today's time thinks when you say Satan, and what a Israelite from the time of Job would think when using the noun ha-satan. You can do more research on your own about that, but suffice to say in this book it is not the force of good (God) making a bet with the force of evil (Satan) at all.\n\n\nInstead of going point by point I'm going to explain to you the wisdom of the text, and you have to understand that if you aren't of faith, then perhaps it will seem odd. To start out Job is a man who has much in life, and lives his life according to the edicts of Judaism. He is a man who carries himself upright, righteously, and is of sound character. Now after the bet Job gets afflicted with numerous awful circumstances. As you pointed out his kids die, and along with them his animals. He gets painful revolting boils on his skin which cause him to stink. Throughout all this he still blesses God, even when his wife says he should curse God, and just keel over and die.\n\nJob's friends come, and they tell Job that he must have sinned, and sinned greatly in order for God to cause such awful sickness on Job. Job says he is innocent, and that his friends essentially don't know what they're talking about. After that there follows much more introspective wisdom about the nature of existence, and the relationship of existence to God. Now, after the friends have had their say, Job calls upon God to judge him, and act as his accuser, his judge, and his jury -- Job is sure he has done nothing to deserve this punishment.\n\n\nAt the end of the book God talks to Job. God tells Job that his friends are wrong. Good things happen to bad people, and bad things happen to good people -- but bad things don't happen to you as a punishment for sin, and the opposite is also not the same. God then tells Job was he around for the formation of the universe? Can he control anything about existance? No? Then Job has no right to question God at all, about anything. Think of it like this: There's a rather large play script that contains everything that has ever happened. Your story is on one of these pages. Let's say your sentence is \"Cooldude638 walks in left stage, slips on a banana peel, and breaks his leg\". You may be understandable upset. You can't possibly see the rest of the script, and where your mishap comes into play, and why what happened, well happened. All you can do is have faith in God.\n\n\nThe Book of Job is addressing misconceptions the Israelites had about the nature of God, and his relationship with the Israelites. Job is most likely not a historical person, the book is not a historical record in the way that the West in modern time keeps historical records, and the Devil is not in this book the thing you think it is.",

He is a wealthy business man with lots of cattle and beloved children. When one day shaytan (satan) in the same way he despided Adam (as) for his success despises Ayub (as). In his anger he decided to turn his people unto him. He whispers to the people that the only reason he is a roghteous and believing person who conveyes the message of Islam is because he is so fortunate and was gifted all of these things by Allah. So Allah tests him, he makes calamity after calamity hit untill all his children are dead, his skin is blemished, his wealth is gone, his crops are dead and his health is non-existant. This goes on for years. (Some sholars say 18 years). In these 18 years Ayub (as) has kept on believing, kept on praying, kept on loving Allah. His wife is the only one he has left to love however and with their situation she has taken to working as help in people's houses. One day her man cannot afford any food whatsoever so she decides to cut and sell her hair for a meal. As she gives the meal to her husband she is met with criticism. Telling her she should not have degraded her in such a way to fill his stomach. In that moment his wife asks him to ask Allah for the end of the test. So he prays and is met with a spring which erupted when he hit his leg on the ground. A spring which gave him back his health, youth, appearance. He then finds mercy again and has even more children and even more health.\n\nWhy I wrote the entire story is because we muslims believe none of these tales are in fact fiction. These stories happened and we believe god to be moral here.\n\nWhy is he right you may ask. First of all Ayub (as) is a prophet sent by god. It is the prophets who are loved most by god and thus tested most to set an example for all of humankind. \n\nGods wisdom transcends that of all creation. He who made everything we love and care about is also on another level of understanding and thinking than the rest of us, in the same way an ant could never understand us humans we will never understands god wisdom. A kid who runs to a fire may be kicked away by his dad  now the kid might think the father is evil but the kid may not understand the danger of the fire.\n\nWe believe life is a test for each and every one of us humans. To say god is cruel for testing with death is lacking in wisdom, death is not the end of life. It is the beginning of an eternal one. And god is merciful those who have had these hard tests will surely meet his mercy.",

            "text": "Worth noting that when Job “gets it all back” in the end, the boils on his skin are not mentioned as a suffering that is taken away from him.  Divine clerical oversight?\n\nMy interpretation of Job is that it is an exploration of what it means to “fear God”, a phrase I heard in church a lot growing up and never really understood.  \n\nBasically, arguing that Job demonstrates that God is not good is kind of besides the point, although it is certainly correct.  What the book of Job says is that God is first and foremost all-powerful and works in “mysterious ways”.  We cannot know his motives (he sure never tells Job about his bet with Satan), nor can we expect to understand them.  \n\nAs a human with typical human values, yes, God treats Job like a dick.  Replace god with a business executive, make Job a loyal factory worker, and Job could sue for a lot of money.  Any other power dynamic we are familiar with makes God look like a vainglorious manipulative scum bag.  \n\nBut if God is all-powerful, or at least if you entertain this notion while considering the book of Job, you realize Job is completely at his mercy.  He asks the same question everyone asks at least once (and for many of us, quite often): why?  And god appears as a tornado and says, “okay, put up your dukes.  By the way, I can kick the ass of leviathan and the minotaur like it’s nothing at all.  I’m God, you’re a human, you don’t get to ask me ‘why’.”  And that’s more than the rest of us ever get.  \n\nBasically, God is God and we are wee little humans.  Sometimes he bestows us with good times, sometimes bad, but we cannot and will not ever know why.  That’s the power dynamic, like it or not.  And hey-life is not *all* bad.  Or at least it can always be worse.",

Job believed that he would get good things if he worshipped god which is why he did it , not because he was truly devout to God.

It does not mean they hate those characters nor does it make them evil.\n\nWhat would the Devil be in this scenario but just someone close to God in a sense, such as the Author's spouse or best friend who likes to be involved with the story but isn't the one who ultimately decides what happens? If you were the God in this story, and maybe you were playing the Sims and your friend bet that you could make the Sims hate you, the player (assuming it were possible in the game), are you evil to take that bet?\n\nAnd another thing about the Bible and God. We have no proof that it happened, nor proof that it didn't. It could be legit real exactly as we believe it, except God doesn't use his God mode powers these days.

The current understanding of how our universe works doesn't allow for it and anyone who argues otherwise doesn't have the deep understanding of mathematics or of the underlying features of the universe. They have no grasp beyond a laymen's understanding of what's happening. Those who do, can make accurate predictions, can build experiments, can test what is observed. In no discription of what's happening is there room for such a being to exist either inside or outside of this universe. It makes no sense to ask if God is good or not because these philosophical questions only extend to life. They are questions about the nature of life itself not questions about the nature of quantum physics or particle physics or any of the fundamental laws of nature. The questions are emergent phenomenons of life. Without life the questions themselves have no meaning and make no sense. Understanding anything beyond the impacts of our own decisions is therefore a waste of time. For me it's more important to understand ourselves than to try and understand a God. I also believe it is our duty to challenge that god because that is the true nature of life. To live.  A god would be an affront to that goal especially one who threatens it so easily like any other form of life does. Again this would mean he is not a God and suggests a higher form of life but it is life seeking a balance as life does in order to thrive. Does this make the concept of life a god? Life attempting to dominate the universe to spread across it. That would be within it's nature but again nature itself is random just like the rest of the forces of nature.\nI'm getting to far ahead of myself now but I suppose to sum it up all these philosophical questions are just an attempt to understand ourselves and they serve no meaning beyond us because they do nothing to explain the actual universe and at the end of the day God is unnecessary to understanding it or ourselves.",

If God is all-knowing and all-powerful, then He must be all-good. All-powerful, by definition, is power over everything, including morality and what’s termed “good”. God defines goodness, and can change what’s good simply by commanding it. If He defines Himself as all-good, then He is.\n\n2. To view any moment in time with modern-day morality will result in complications of what is good and what is not. Hindsight reveals hidden motives that are not clear within the given time period. \n\nThe Chernobyl reactor was a great thing; it supplied well needed power to thousands of people. We only know that it is “not good” because it blew up. But is that just us misinterpreting the information of history? Was it better to supply power to thousands of people for years, and then have the reactor melt down, or would’ve it been better to have no power at all? \n\nA better analogy would be World War 2. Across the board, almost everyone would say WW2 was “not good”. But had WW2 not occurred, perhaps we would’ve simply entered a nuclear Cold War, Germany would have continued their genocide of Jewish people, and the Japanese would’ve conquered and enslaved China. Now this would be REALLY not good, and therefore, WW2 was, in fact, good.\n\nViewing a single piece of history without knowing the consequences of the alternate situation  does not give enough insight to whether an event, person, or thing was either good or not. This leads me to point 3.\n\n3. Touching back to the first point, if God is all-knowing, then he KNOWS the situation that will work out best for Job and his family and everyone else in the world. He knows that this factors into His master plan and X many people will come to know Christ because of the story of Job. While we don’t see it as “good”, God certainly knows that it is good.\n\nA great story example would be Joseph and his brothers. They left Joseph to die (very NOT good of God to simply have his brothers abandon him), but as it states in the word, God MEANT for this to happen and it seems like it worked out pretty good for Joseph.\n\nAccording to the Bible, God is good, and wants to give us His goodness. We live in a broken world filled with Sin. There will always be not good until we arrive in heaven with God. This is what the Bible preaches, and thus shows, God and his intentions are good, even if non-good things happen. That’s because if the world was only good, then we’d already be in heaven.",

You’re a human, a pissant molecular sneeze that eats their genetic cousins and fucks their actual ones. God really doesn’t have to explain what God does, but Job has a point.

Or you might have already failed or passed and don’t know it. Well. I’m pretty sure you know if you passed. But either way, you do it.\n\nWith the knowledge you have, you do the best you can. You be thankful it isn’t worse, and strive and pray for better. Perhaps pray that when it’s time for your Trial, you can keep your head down, thank God for mercy when it comes, and know that—you’re right, it does suck. But don’t lose faith in what you know is True. And God is that One Truth.\n\nOr something like that. It’s always dramatic, and terrifying in the moment but you get that nervous chuckle after it’s over and you’re not sure if it’s gonna come back again or not but you know that, yes, it will—but not the same way. Never the same way. Sometimes the same lesson, but sometimes the perspective needs to be different. As many times as it takes for the lesson to be learnt. Because sometimes you need to learn something again as someone different in order to get what the lesson meant the first time, and to wonder what it means to you now—and what it might mean the next time.",

Iyov remained silent on the matter and so god did not object on his behalf when the Satan set it's eyes on him. Just as he did not speak up to spare the jews' suffering so god did not speak up to spare his or at least not for quite a while. \n\n2.

            "text": "There was a free lecture series, forgot the name, about a critical reading of Job. The short version is that, Job was in contradiction to the train of thought in the other Wisdom books which is evil is punished and good is rewarded. There is a bunch of sayings along those lines in Proverbs. Do this good thing, you will be rewarded, evil doers laugh now but they are punished, etc. etc.\n\nJob disagrees with all that, and asks the question, what is true righteousness? Similar to the Greeks question, is piety pious because the gods favor it, or do the gods favor piety because it is pious? The bulk of the book has Job clinging onto his righteousness, despite all the suffering. His friends suspect him of a secret sin, and urge him to confess and ask for forgiveness. Everyone else turns their back, his servant and his wife even. But he still held onto his righteousness.\n\nIn the end God says Job's friends were wrong. The righteous does suffer. Which now makes the reader question, have they oppressed someone who was suffering, on the assumption they were evil? Have they done good or avoided evil only because of rewards and punishment? Did they excuse themselves from helping a suffering person because they think that person had a secret sin and deserved it? And so on...\n\nI think the book's point, taken on its own merits, with the context the author was probably in, is actually quite good. What is the true nature of righteousness and all that. I think it does the text a diservice to butcher it by reading it through the doctrines modern Christianity, and trying to make it fit. The author was not a modern Christian, it was not even a thing while he was writing,  he was not making a modern  Christian point, so what point was he making?\n\nIf we ask the question thay way, we see the author and the text in a better light I think. And while the text does not paint a good God in the modern Christian best friend type of deal, it paints the picture of a more wholly other type powerful type of being, like a Mr. Manhattan, whose gift is creation that he brags about which allows for the  possibility for righteousness, but its mostly upto to people to make that happen.

But from the Christian view - well it's **very** debatable and basically was a product of trade-off when Christianity became the main religion in Rome. \n\nBecause as you observed with Job's story, or what we can observe in Exodus is a very malicious and trickster God who is very willing to play with his subjects even killing innocent children to prove a point. This is hardly compatible with the all-loving God of Jesus who is all about acceptance. The Exodus story - where contrary to the popular belief that the Pharaoh had a choice and was the villain of the story; God directly altered the Pharaoh's mind to not accept Moses' proposals - in every religion would be the working of a malicious, evil or just a trickster God who in the end would get his fair share of troubles - but in modern Christianity, Christians supposed to believe that God's actions were morally acceptable and they are part of its Grand Design.",

            "text": "I think the key takeaway with this book is that our morality, even as robust as Job's, has it's limits. In the book, as Job is defending himself from his \"friends\" he mentions the iniquity of his youth. None of our morality is perfect. So even though there is scant evidence in the story itself (I actually just recently read it in its entirety) Elihu admonishes him for justifying himself rather than God. \n\nJordan Peterson has a 51min lecture somewhere on youtube on the necessity of virtue. He describes the scene of Adam and Eve and the serpent in a way I hadn't heard described before. After Adam and Eve ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and their eyes were opened they realized they were naked. He said we as humans fear being naked, physically and emotionally. That's why they covered themselves with leaves and twigs, presumably from the tree they just ate. \n\nThat covering they ate represents the rationalization they had to make up to justify their own sin. This is analogous in my view to the stance Job took in justifying himself rather than God. The bible is very clear that there is none righteous, not even one. That's why when God returned and found them naked, he made them a covering for their nakedness out of skins. He was teaching them their sin has a cost. This is an idea we need to wear in order to become okay with the idea of being so vulnerable with all the guilt and shame and anxiety we carry with us. \n\nThat is the crux of what Christianity is about: the wages of sin is death, and its cost was covered by the expense of Jesus' blood. So even though Job was righteous, his righteousness was not his own. And when he determined that to no longer be the case, that's when he lost his way. Jesus said, “Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.” This is what the religious leaders failed to do during Jesus' day, and what so many fail to recognize to this day. We are supposed to pick up our cross and follow Him. I hope this made sense without being too preachy.",

            "text": "Congrats, you’ve distracted me from work. Great topic!\n\nMy first observation is that you seem happy to gloss over a lot of the good God did with His own hand in this very story. You even bolded the verse about His hand stretching out (11), but what do you have to say regarding the verse immediately before (10)? God is in fact the giver of all the good things in this story, in the beginning and at the end. There’s nothing good in the first place without Him giving it, but you seem content to ignore all that in favor of (dare I say) a pre-determined mindset. Careful now.\n\nI was troubled by the accusations of murder. If a human purposely ends another human’s life, that is murder. If the giver of life allows life to expire, is that considered murder? I don’t think so. Doesn't a creator retain ultimate authority over their creation. A painter can change his painting or destroy it if he pleases. You’ve created this post and you have some authority over it, the mods have more, but ultimately Reddit has all authority over it. They built the platform and if they decided to cancel this post or the entire r/ then it’s not illegal. It’s their creation and they allow us to contribute. Even if we disagree and think they are corrupt, big whoop. They made it and retain a legal right to unmake anything on it. They don’t get fined if they delete your post.\n\nYou’re unhappy that all the “iNnOcEnT” people died. (Of course we have no idea what their moral behavior was.) Regardless, we can all agree that they did not deserve to die, except that none of them (or us) “dEsErVeD” to live in the first place. Did you earn your birth? Will you deserve death? I digress. Look I get it, I don’t like that part of this story. No one does and we’re not supposed to. Some will say (via faith) that God made it up to those folks in heaven. Sure, why not! Some will say their life’s purpose was served in death, that ultimately they were an instrument in an important story about God’s identity and thus served their reason for living. Okay, cool idea! Or some will say God is an evil murderer. To each their own! We’re all guessing. Just keep in mind that opinions are not evidence of truth.\n\nAs creator, God retains a legal right over His creation, whether we like it or not. It’s not a narcissistic authority thing, but a simple reality. If we find His actions distasteful because they don’t fit our moral liking, that’s fine, doesn’t matter. Calling those actions “immoral” is meaningless, because we don’t define morality. He does. Even if we say He’s isn’t fitting the definition He gave us, breaking His own rules, enjoying some double standard, oh well, still doesn’t matter. More importantly, that doesn’t make Him bad or evil. We can be justified in our distaste, but He’s God, take it or leave it. My kids have rules in my house that I myself don’t have to follow. They can call it unfair and maybe they’re right, but I’m not a bad father. Furthermore, I’m a good father by staying home when I can, interacting with them, dutifully providing for them, and many other things. Me following the same rules I give them is a non-factor in deciding if I’m a good father. If I ask my toddler if I’m a good dad, he might be mad that he isn't allowed soda. Or if I ask my teen, he may say I’m a terrible dad because I stay up late and he can’t. Neither of them could even explain to me what a mortgage is. So for us to be debating if God is good, and using the book of Job like it’s court evidence…bruh. We know nothing. Probably a better idea look carefully at our lives instead. Let Him get involved, then stick a finger in the pudding and taste it. Obviously, we each have to make our own call on something faith-based like that. But I think it’s a deeply flawed approach to go after His morality by picking apart one ancient story. It doesn’t prove anything except what we wanted to believe beforehand.\n\nAbout the “bet” as you repeatedly call it …was really it a wager since there was no payoff involved? What was the risk/reward here? Seems to me more like an accusation and defense, not a gamble. But even if it was a bet, to call it “trivial” is another step too far, because it was not about God seeking His own entertainment or ego-stroke …like the way we humans are when we go betting on some stupid dare. The devil didn’t respond with “Hold my beer.” (Again, you’ve thought of God as a person like us, but He’s not.) In fact, this was about an attack on His reputation and the way He ran His creation, and the only evidence that could disprove the accusation was to test the theory (not to test Job’s faith!) but to test the accusation and see if it held muster. It was not a game. It was critically necessary to make sure God was running creation in a way that was good for humans, in a way that humans could trust and respect. Job was not being tested, God’s work was being tested. Job was the measuring stick, or even the judge if you will, since his word carried all the weight. But even if God’s work had failed and Job had cursed Him, what prize would the accuser win? Nothing. God would still be god. This was not a bet or gamble, but a sacrosanct litmus test on identity. He had to pass. If Job, the most blessed of all men, cursed God, then wouldn’t all of us? That’s what was at stake.\n\nAlthough you highlighted (11), you again glossed over the immediate next verse (12) in which God puts the responsibility for action straight back into the accuser’s hands–as if it were a hot potato. The accuser then had the opportunity to back down and didn’t. It was him who initiated the situation and it was him who carried out the test, not God. God gave the power away in that moment, essentially surrendering His omnipotence for the sake of the all-important test. I understand “the problem with evil” and all that, but it doesn’t really apply here. He handed His power to the accuser and the accuser did the evil things with it. That’s on the accuser. Besides, the “problem with evil” debate is a debate, not a truth. In the end we each blame evil on whoever we want, then find the logic to fit our decision. If you read this story and see God as the evil one (making the accuser innocent?), seems to me you kinda had your thoughts settled going into it.\n\nLastly, about all of God’s scolding and “I’ll destroy you petty mortals” kinda stuff. I mean, isn’t He entitled at that point to put everyone in their place? (Not that I'm entitled to say what He's entitled to, lol.) But the accuser was wrong. Job’s friends were wrong. Job himself, though he didn’t curse God, he didn’t exactly “trust through the storm” either. He spent most of the time defending his own “rIgHtEoUsNeSs.” To me, God needed to correct every perspective–not because of His ego, but because clarity matters. He IS all powerful and He IS loving first. All He ever directly did in this story was so much GOOD that all that tragedy still couldn’t outweigh it. That’s the big big thing your view seems to miss. This story is about the prequel that doesn’t exist, in which God pours so much blessing onto this man that even this level of heinous injustice could not convince him that God was evil. Yet somehow this exact story has convinced you the opposite? Interesting.\n\nEdit: typos, punctuation, paragraphs",

            "text": "There is a interesting mini book called \"Religion\" which uses the writing of Karen Armstrong to argue the purpose of religion and tries to \"explain\" the concept of God. She is a former nun turned religious scholar. I would recommend that book as a read.\n\nOne important argument that is stated in the book is that, by the very nature of who God is (omnipotent, omnipresent, all powerful, etc), it is a foolish task to try to define or understand something that is infinitely greater than your possibility of understanding (literally, given the physical space and capabilities of a human brain). Thus, to apply something such as a moral judgement on an all knowing God implies that you know as much to apply a moral judgement as God does. Most people who believe in a greater God would view that as hubris. Sounds like a cop-out to say \"You can't know God's will\" until you acknowledge the premise that you can't possibly know as much as an omnipotent being.\n\nFor example, let's take the example that God \"murdered innocent family members\". If God is the giver of life and can determine how long that life is allowed to live, could it not be argued that choosing to end a life early is within his rights? We may disagree with whether the length of time given is \"good\" or \"bad\", but that choice was not ours to make, but God's.\n\nSecondly, utilitarianism argues that what is morally \"right\" is those actions which creates the greatest happiness. If you believe that by being a servant of God, you will receive the eternal reward of happiness next to God, one must ask: if a moment of harsh living (even if that moment is an entire lifetime) results in eternal, infinite happiness, are not God's actions \"morally good\" from a utilitarian POV?\n\n(Not arguing for utilitarianism, just one ideology to demonstrate a point).\n\nMy overall point is that to try to define, constrain, understand, etc God is futile because God is omnipotent, omnipresent, all powerful, etc. Your moral judgement calls of God's actions are not the same as God's. This may seem very dismissive, but only because even in this long post, so much is left unsaid. I think it boils down to:\n\nOur understanding of God is fundamentally limited, and thus flawed. Therefore, any explanation of God, his actions, etc. is also limited and flawed.",

The way you've framed things also indicates to me that you are fine with that, as long as you can make a declarative that you're right. So this might be fruitless.\n\nRegardless...\n\nWhat you've got here is a \"knowing the mind of God\" type problem, that is also tied up with, let's say \"mortal\", conceptions of good an evil; as well as, a very specific way of experiencing time and the universe. Simply defining terms in your argument is going to be difficult if not impossible.\n\nI'm not going to address your argument, but try and provide some ways to reframe it so that it can ask useful questions.\n\nSome food for thought, God is meant to represent infinite power and capability.\n\nThe very idea of that concept is extremely large. Like, large enough that your brain isn't prepared to cogitate the terms without some perspective shift, and even at your best you're only getting the silhouette of the thing you're trying to understand.\n\nTo ground this highminded horseshit a little, consider Back to The Future. Relatively paradox free, easy to understand, fairly linear and uncomplicated. There might be some goofs, but it's all lampshaded and not meant to be a perfect description of 4th dimensional travel anyway.\n\nThen you've got something like Primer, and if you haven't grasped every single nuance in one pass, you're certainly not going to understand the mind of a being that is conceptually perfect at manipulating things 4th dimesionally (and more). I don't know about you, but I spent half of Primer trying to figure out, even in the vaguest sense, what the fuck was even happening.\n\nMortality and suffering are extremely fleeting things on these kinds of scales.\n\nThings that seem very, very important to you now, will be absolutely insignificant in the supposed afterlife of judeo-christianity. If you can't wrap your head around \"That's a problem for future Homer\" from an eternal afterlife perspective, you're going to be stuck with a  temporal morality that changes from moment to moment. And hey, that's great, maybe it's also real, whatever that means. I'm not saying that's the wrong way of looking at things, but it isn't the default stance of the Christian God claim. Eternity is a long time, and going through something tough now to end up in the best state possible later, isn't exactly a definitively Evil thing.\n\nPutting this in perspective, it means that something like the Holocaust (or any such sufficiently Evil thing) COULD potentially be justifiable if it preserves something else, for example, Free Will. If God has to circumvent Free Will to prevent Evil, and his imperative is to allow Free Will, then it is both logical and rational that he allow the possibility of Evil, albeit temporarily. This in no way impinges on the idea of an All-Powerful God, allowing a thing is not the same thing as being powerless to do anything about it.\n\nI think, what this really boils down to is, can God create perfect beings that will commit no Evil even though they freely have the ability to do so? Since he knows all outcomes, why bother with doing it for \"real\", instead of virtually, or as a \"thought experiment\", and then just beginning with a system that is at a starting state of whatever the outcome of \"all of this\" is.\n\nThere is the implication that the way things are, is unnecessary, so that begs the question, why is it that way? Since God is a creator and the universe is the created, what is the reason that things are the way they are? (For reference, applying some Plato here gets interesting. In a spontaneous Universe that is not created, the nature of the universe does not require definition, but in a created Universe, it absolutely does. It requires a purpose. Plato is a good tool to use when trying to understand the whole Watchmaker idea.)\n\nNow I think we can start asking some really interesting questions about the nature of Free Will, regardless of Christianity, and drill down on what the idea of God reflects in us, as a human beings. Once those questions are ironed out, I think we can revisit the whole \"Why Does God Let Evil Things Happen\" issue. In answering a question about the nature of free will, we've filled in a piece of the puzzle about why things are the way they are. Having said that, I'm not sure it's even a valid question.\n\nI'm not a bible nut, I don't qualify as Christian by any metrics other than the Ministry of Christ. I don't take the Bible literally, and I don't consider it to be the unaltered and perfect Word of God. At best, it's stories written by human beings trying to understand something much larger than themselves. I really dislike Job (along with much of the Old Testament) and I really don't understand it's inclusion or the reason it goes about teaching a lesson that it apparently circumvents itself. It's a clusterfuck of ideas that might have some value when completely parsed out, but the meta-questions it requires answers to in order to make sense don't cleanly represent any moral paradigm, which you would assume to be the point.\n\nHowever, I'll fully admit that not understanding Job, for me, might just be symptomatic of being imperfect.\n\nTL;DR - Using Job to create a strawman that God is an Asshole isn't a fresh take. It's a small minded argument for small minded people, regardless of whatever faith or lack thereof you choose to practice.",

The TL;DR explanation is Job was a great man and servant of God, and despite losing all the worldly things that everyone would have held dear, Job never stopped loving and praising God.  Job didn’t curse God, Job was in fact desperate to know what he had done to damage his relationship with God.  Job didn’t get angry and prideful thinking that he was entitled to a good life, but shaved his head and rubbed himself down with ashes which was an expression with humility.  God resists and takes formation against the prideful. Since God was the number one love and priority in his life, there was nothing the devil could do to take that would steer him away from God.  God didn’t manipulate Job, he also didn’t tempt Job past Job’s ability to resist, and in the end Job was rewarded with God giving him even better things than he had before.  The things we think we own on this earth aren’t ours, but are God’s.  The only thing we have is our faith, and what is the point of faith if it’s never tested?  God knows everything, including the outcome of the test before it happens.  The test is to show us our faith, our strengths and weaknesses, and how much we need God in our lives.  You can’t put God at the same standards as humans, because he already knows everything.  When you pass the test, God will give you everything you have lost back but better and overflowing.",

            "text": "The story of Job is often misinterpreted. \nJob was a faithful and favorite servant of God. Satan once again challenged God right to rule and said every man would betray God if their life was at stake. He also said that the only reason that Joe was faithful was because God gave him so many good things. And without all of those rewards, Joe would not be loyal to Him. God said that Job would not. \nWhen Satan persisted, God said that he would allow Satan to test him but that he was not allowed to kill him. Satan then proceeded to kill all of Jobs children, herds, and took his health. His own wife even told him to curse God so he could die. Jobs previous friends even tried to get him to denounce God as well. \nJob thought at one point that God might be punishing him after he was so sick and the lesions on him itched him near to madness, but he still refused to denounce God… even when he was very close to death. In the end Satan was proved a liar thus proving that humans could live faithfully till death. God then put a stop to satans testing. He replaced all that Job had lost and more to show how happy Jobs loyalty had made him. Of course his previous children could never be replaced. Satan, being the trickster that he was, took the lives of his family members because he could not kill Job. I am quite sure that that broke God’s heart as well. As it should when we see our friends or family and people we love die and suffer. \n\nThere is a theme to the Bible. Throughout it, there is the constant questioning and challenging of God’s sovereignty by Satan and the angels who decided to follow him (demons). The first test Satan ever gave was to Eve. \nJames chapter 1 verse 13 states that God does not test us and with evil this he cannot be tested.\n\nThe story of Job is a very important one even today. There are a lot of people out there that think that all the suffering that we see around us today is some kind of test for a punishment from God. The story of Job is one example in the Bible of many where you can clearly see that it is not God who tests. God is not the cause of the things that we see in the bad things that happens to us. We should put the blame for that directly on the one truly responsible. And according to the Bible, God’s sovereignty will be proven for all time. He even went a step further later when he sent Jesus. He sent him here to live as a human for Satan to test until death. This time he allowed him to actually kill him because he had to prove that it’s a human could Stay faithful until death. That’s not all came here for but that’s one of the very big reasons. He himself even said so. Understanding the stories that are within the Bible requires more than just reading about that story in particular. The Bible, like many books, you need to read the whole thing every single page if you are going to understand what’s going on and why the stories being told and even then how it applies to you. \nMany believe that these stories are not historical. And that’s understandable for them to believe. I’m not going to argue that because that’s a different subject. \nThe stories in the Bible like that a job, Are meant to teach us. These stories teach us how to be good people and how to live a good life and prosper. Jobs story is a wonderful example that bad things can happen to everyone. Even those who are good. Too many people think that if you’re good, bad things will not happen (like that of karma) and in my experience, bad things to happen to good people more often than not. \nIn most cases, it’s like what king Solomon always said, bad things happen to good people because no matter who you are or how you live, time and unforeseen events befall everyone. \nLater, Jesus used the example of rain. When it rains, it falls on the good and evil alike. \nThere are many such examples. In order to really understand Jobs story, it’s important to read the others as well because there is a reoccurring theme and a point to all of it. The entire Bible, even though it is made up of many small books, has the same Purpose and subject. \nJust like reading a Michael Crichton book. It may not make sense if you read the chapters as individual stories. You have to do it chronologically and understand the reason that he is saying what he saying. Some of it doesn’t even make sense until you read the whole thing and then you have a lightbulb moment and you start to understand what he was saying from the get-go. I know it’s weird to compare God to Michael Crichton but it’s simply an illustration. If you read the book in the way that the author intended, and using language that the reader can understand, it becomes simple. And then it makes sense.\nMany Bibles are written in a language that people today do not understand. There are many translations of the Bible and my favorites are ones that use plain simple English. Anyway I know that I’m going on and on. I am sorry about that and I didn’t mean to write a book here. I am an avid Bible reader and I remember when I started it I felt very similar to how you do. And it wasn’t until I read the entire thing from cover to cover four or five times before the proverbial lightbulb turn on over my head. Most of the Bible is just made up of lessons for us to learn but every store in it has a reoccurring theme once you look deeper. Especially when you have the mindset of understanding that Those who wrote these Bible books did so under inspiration. Kind of like a secretary dictates a letter. This is why most of the styles of writing are the same and the message is the same.\nMost of this can answer many questions about the story of Job and why and how it came about. The bigger question here is why do good people suffer if God is so loving. There are answers to that but it takes a little bit more than what I can put on Reddit to explain. I do encourage people to read it because even if you just think it’s a book of fantastical stories, there are some beautiful lessons, amazing poetry, exciting battles, underdogs that achieve amazing feats…. And the best part is that if you take the lessons from it, it teaches you empathy and forgiveness, how to show grace to people who’ve never even asked for it. I teach you how to be a good person and not once in my lifetime has any of the lessons that I learned by reading it ever steered me wrong. It has helped me not to hate people who have done bad things, not to judge people who have done horrible things. And most of all, I just hate it sometimes there’s more going on than I realize. Anyway, sorry again for the book. The story of Job is one of my favorites and I’m very glad that you have given me an opportunity to discuss it. I apologize if I have any typos here. I use talk to text a lot because I can’t find my reading glasses right now. I had to go back in and Edit this just because I felt like I needed to elaborate. Sorry",

            "text": "I don't believe in The Bible anymore but I used to and I read it a lot and still find it interesting. \n\nThe way I understand it is that in The Bible it is alluded to that Satan was created long before humans. Eventually He started questioning why Jesus Christ had a higher position than himself. Why did God consult with Jesus and not him? On the surface there is really nothing necessarily wrong with that question. But then He started talking with the other angels about how he would make different decisions. Give them more input, run things better. Politics basically. \n\nBut He wasn't jealous for the good of the universe. Rather he was envious for the power of God. However nobody could know that except for God. Only God is omniscient, so only God can know the motive, sentiment, and intent of anyone. Only God can hear the inner thoughts, the inner processes of the mind, of everyone. None of the angels can do that, and that to me is the key to understanding The Bible. Interestingly it is also the key to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and many people would be a lot better mentally if they stopped thinking as if they are God. That they ever know the motives of other peoples actions, whether good or bad. Society would be way healthier if we stuck to only judging the actions of ourselves and others. Society is pretty sick right now, but I digress.\n\nAnyhoo, so God now had to allow the brewing rebellion in heaven to grow until it boiled over and everyone could see that Satan wanted to overthrow God. But God couldn't just destroy Satan and the angels that had made up their mind to side with Satan, because as I'll explain later their are still questions and doubts remaining among the angels. So God kicks out Satan and the rebellious angels from heaven that are warring against God.\n\nHowever Satan is still free to visit other worlds and go to government meetings in heaven to make his case against God. So he comes to earth and gets Eve to disobey God by introducing doubts into her mind about God's benevolence by claiming that the rule not to eat of the forbidden fruit was motivated by God not wanting us to become a God. So Eve rebelled and The Bible says that decision lead to death and suffering entering into the world.\n\nAt that point it should be clear that Satan just wanted power at any cost. His motive was revealed. But the controversy isn't over. The question still remains as to whether God is benevolent. Or if He is underneath it all just like Satan, but omnipotent and able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes.\n\nSo God offers up himself as a sacrifice for the sins of those who wish to repent and return to heaven. Job is a type of Jesus Christ. He is willing to sacrifice his life and remain obedient to God. Just as the Jesus Christ of The Bible did. Jesus Christ left behind everything in heaven. He was willing to lose everything and everyone he loved and yet remain obedient to God under the most trying conditions. And in the end The Bible says he gained back even more than he lost. Not only did he return to heaven but everyone who repents and accepts him as their ruler will return to heaven too. So like Job gained in riches so did God.\n\nThe Bible says that God allows tests to come upon people to reveal to all of heaven that their motive, sentiment, and intent for obeying God is good. Sure God could do this without a test and know for himself who deserves to be safe in heaven and who deserved to be lost. But The Bible says that God wants to prove it to everyone else, which is what a benevolent ruler would want to do even if causes himself a lot of pain and suffering. So in order to prove who he is good and evil God has to allow evil things to happen sometimes. If God didn't allow that then God could never answer the questions and doubts about his own motive, and evil would have to continue to exist in the universe for eternity. Which is far worse than allowing it to exist for now. What is 6,000 years in comparison to eternity? In eternity future nobody will remember the pain and suffering, only that God is a benevolent ruler and that their will never again be a reason to doubt that.",

            "text": "I know I’m a little late to this party but I would like to take a shot. \n\nAs others have mentioned the story of job is an extended parable, not an actual historical event. I think additionally it is important to realize that from an academic point of view that Job is likely the oldest book of the bible, with its terminus ante quem (latest possible date written) older than many books of the bibles terminus post quem (earliest possible date written). This is of course based to historic literary records. \n\nBased on this I would posit that the God represented in the book of Job is an earlier incarnation of the Judeo-Christian than seen else where in the bible. This is further supported by the inclusion of a Satan which was not how we envision him today. In the story of Job The Satan (or adversary) acts the same as the role of a certain position in near eastern courts as the time that goes by the same name. The task of the Satan in middle eastern courts was to root out potential dissenters as seen in the story. This gives credence to the idea that the God and heavenly host of the book of Job is significantly different than the Judeo-Christian seen elsewhere in the bible, with a God who behaves like an ancient near eastern king and a Satan that is a member of his host and not the father of lies. \n\nIn summary or TLDR, the book is an extended allegory. Additionally, the book of Job is likely the oldest book of the bible and the God represented there in has different mannerisms than the God depicted elsewhere in the bible. One of the main difference seen is the handling on Satan.",
