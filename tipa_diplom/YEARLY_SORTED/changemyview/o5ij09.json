    "CMV: Elon Musk is vastly Overrated\nI am currently studying to become an engineer with focus on air/space flight, and a lot of colleagues tell me  they want to work for Elon Musk. And i just dont get the hype, (the spaceX rockets are not bad dont get me wrong), I ( and especially data) tell that they are not that efficient as the majority thinks they are, since the fuel they need to save for landing is obviously lost in flight, so they need more fuel and ,more Important, the last bit of fuel is the most valuable; Also the idea of reusing rockets isn't new, NASA thought about it too,they just thought it was too inefficient for the reasons I wrote before too. Plus Elon Musk seems to be super nice with his Twitter account and all,  but I frequently hear storys about the working conditions at his facilitys and it doesn't sound that appealing ngl, also some of the things he did, regarding bitcoin or doge coin, and no I didn't invest in those, resulting in lots of people losing their money, dont really support that Image of the freaky nice billionair . On the other hand he worked really hard and somehow he isnt broke, so i want to understand how you guys think about him.\n\nEdit 1) Since I got this reply a lot, you guys are right with the low cost per Kilogramm to Orbit. \nI decided to not take on this Argument since SpaceX later on got heavily funded by NASA (after they invented the falcon 1 , merlin, Kestrel, and Draco engines).\nI must confess i dont know if they still get an extra amount of money per launch like they used to get( at least i think they did), so probably the cost per Kilogramm would be much higher if they had higher Research expenses.\n Also i know that getting funded is not unusal, in my opinion it just doesnt Match the whole \" we /I did it also by myself\" image": [

Bang for the buck is what matters. Fuel is cheap, rockets are expensive. Spending more fuel to land the rocket is an amazingly good tradeoff.\n\nBesides engineering-wise, don't you think it's absolutely amazing to be able to look at the thing after the flight? If your entire device is floating in space or sinks into the ocean, you can't physically examine and see what happened. Every time SpaceX lands a rocket they get a huge amount of data on the state of every component. \n\n> Also the idea of reusing rockets isnt new, NASA thought about it too they just thought it was too ineffizient for the reasons i wrote before too\n\nIdeas are overall worthless. Everyone has ideas, and \"let's land the rocket\" is not that amazing of one. Actually accomplishing it for a reasonable price is what's cool. NASA did it with the Shuttle but it didn't quite work, because maintenance on it turned out to be far too expensive. SpaceX actually got it right.\n\n> Plus Elon Musk seems to be super nice with his Twitter account and all, but i frequently hear Storys about the working conditions at his facilitys and it doesnt Sound that appealing ngl,\n\nWork/life balance at SpaceX sucks by all accounts, yes. IMO most people enthusiastic about him concentrate on the \"he gets awesome stuff done\" part and don't particularly care about the working conditions, assuming that hey, if you don't like it, you can always work somewhere else. SpaceX hires smart people that should have other options.\n\n> also some of the things he did regarding bitcoin or doge coin resulting in lots of people losing their money\n\nCrypto is a bloody mess, and honestly I don't care about Musk messing around with people in that area. It's what they signed up for anyway. The crypto space is full of people who think there should be no regulations whatsoever, and that it's a no man's land where you succeed or fail by your own merits.

In fact, he is correctly rated the best in the world.\n\nIt is extremely rare for someone to disrupt an industry by popularizing a completely new category of product. Elon Musk has disrupted *three*. You could even argue that Tesla's entire business model is about serial disruption as the company moves downmarket.\n\n1. [X.com/Paypal](https://X.com/Paypal) is the OG fintech company, and how Musk joined the \"Paypal\" mafia with the likes of Thiel, etc. Web, mobile, and contactless payments are not just quickly becoming the norm, but for unbanked populations, they've turned into an alternative to conventional financial institutions.\n2. Tesla has not disrupted internal combustion cars (yet), but has completely upended the supercar market (Roadster, Model S, and Model X), and the entry-level luxury car market (Models 3 and Y). It is well on its way to supplanting normal entry-level cars (future hatchback EVs and other models). Pretty much everyone agrees that, in terms of comfort, performance, and safety, Teslas are the best EVs out there, and they cost a fraction of what you would pay for an ICE car with similar characteristics.\n3. SpaceX has made low-cost, reusable rockets practical. To appreciate Musk's accomplishments in this regard, you have to apply systems thinking beyond just engineering. The lifecycle cost of a SpaceX rocket is a tiny fraction of a conventional single-use one. And we haven't talked about the potential for Starlink to bring broadband to previously inaccessible areas.\n\nI don't think Musk should be uncritically worshipped or anything. But it helps to have a sense of perspective. Very few people are capable of, or willing to do, what he's done.",

He says something and stocks shift in response. If he wasn't promoting electric vehicles and solar, would it have nearly as pervasive of a reach as it does now?\n\nTake for example Tesla. Before 2008, electric cars were definitely not considered desirable. This was not really because of limits from technology -- we had been making electric cars forever. Then the roadster came along. it was sleek, expensive, classy, and fast. It was the kind of car you could imagine in a 007 movie. Most importantly, people *wanted* it, more than most gas-powered alternatives. Tesla made the electric car a lifestyle for the smart, forward thinking, and innovative individual. The Apple‚Ñ¢Ô∏è of cars. In doing so, it promoted people living a more sustainable lifestyle. None of this was necessarily a technological achievement, but instead a sociological and economical overcoming, which often times is the harder challenge.\n\nAs for things he has done that's personally bad, that's undeniable, but it's quite easy to point out a lot of negatives on anyone in the public eye holding any influence. As an alternative example, take Teddy Roosevelt. Yeah, he broke up big companies, conserved nature, and built out America's infrastructure. He was also an outspoken racist who did some pretty unforgivable stuff to Indigenous Americans. Does the good \"undo\" the bad? No. He's a mixed figure.",

However then you‚Äôd have to construct more boosters and have a lower flight cadence. Look at how often they launch that rocket compared to any other similar performance vehicle and you‚Äôll see.

Now we have Zelle, Venmo (now paypal though) and others.\n* improve electric vehicle adoption and competition (Tesla).  Before, EVs were spotty, and limited.  Now, we finally have the big three deciding that maybe this EV thing could work.  Ford just went all ‚Äúlookie how cool we are‚Äù, which was trite, but the F150 is a huge market.  Without Tesla, these other EVs would not be here yet.\n* improve spaceflight launch cost competition.  Before, the legacy aerospace builders were still using 1950s/1960s technology.  Launch costs were huge due to disposability, especially after the orbiter program was sunset for recurring heat shield issues.  Now, we launch at 1/10th the cost per kilo to space, and other countries are competing again.  We‚Äôre about to get into a new space race eith China.\n\nNow, personally, I love these techs in principle, but also, all of them have cascade benefits to society, technological innovation, etc.  It‚Äôs not just ‚Äúcool‚Äù.

But Elon would never claim to be freaky nice or even a little nice.   \n\n\nI'd just add one thing. I've seen critics say he wasn't a founder of Tesla. In fact, he was one of the first investors, and he invested before the roadster was even created. He was definitely a founder, and he was definitely the main person who made that company succeed.  \n\n\nI don't know much about Spacex. Obviously you are an expert in that area. However, I would say you and others are mis-characterizing his crypto play. He's said many times that Doge Coin is a joke. So anybody investing in Doge based on Elon is responsible for their own lack of research.  \n\n\nAs for Bitcoin, Elon's play is that he has a lot of cash, and he's keeping it for future investments. He's trying to find creative ways for his cash to hold value. And he's trying to get Millennials to buy his cars. Millennial wealth is 25% in crypto. So that's his play, but he's been open about his concerns. If you don't have concerns about crypto, you're blind. If anything, Elon should be applauded for his transparency.",

Aluminium, as used in rockets, is highly stressed, and has an extremely fatigue limited life (perhaps as low as a dozen or so launches) which makes reuse barely a win. Stainless steel has much, much longer life in this context, and this seems to be a tremendous advantage, probably hundreds of flights. Because rockets that can be reused have to be larger, having the hardware last much longer, slashes the per-flight cost (propellant cost is an after thought, *except that it increases the costs of the hardware*).",

            "text": "To specifically address the point of view of an aerospace engineering student, I‚Äôd like to share my experience as an aerospace engineering post StarshipOne and prior to SpaceX.  Should shed some light on why Elon and Space X are seen as a big deal.\n\nIn that time period, the only major rocket builder in the USA was United Launch Alliance, making and operating the Atlas and Delta series. The ESA was launching Ariane series rockets, the Russians Proton series and the Chinese the Long March series. The other American big platform was discontinued, the Titan series, and NASA was going nowhere with a replacement for the Shuttle.\n\nAmerica had no launch programs carrying humans.  The Ariane 5 was human launch capable but they‚Äôd never built a capsule. The Chinese are a black box for American engineering R&D because of their National security apparatus.  So we were relying on ancient Soyuz tech to launch all manned missions.\n\nIf your were a space-focused AE student, you had limited options: work for a classified agency on classified payloads, build communications satellites, build launch vehicles for ULA, or work on hypothetical projects for NASA.  Nobody took  SpaceShipOne and space tourism seriously, given that it felt like a one-off for billionaire fame. SpaceShipTwo had been unveiled but hadn‚Äôt even undergone a powered test flight.\n\nThat was a bleak time to be getting into space stuff as an AE student. I got out precisely because the career opportunities weren‚Äôt interesting.\n\nThen Space X, which most people had thought was another vanity project, got the contract for ISS resupply. They went from ‚Äúoh hey maybe a little satellite launch program by a rich person‚Äù to ‚Äúthis is the legitimate future of commercial space flight‚Äù very quickly.  December 2010 they orbit a Dragon capsule, the first orbit and recovery by a commercial company. Cool. But by May 2012, less than 18 months later, they were docking with ISS.\n\nThat suddenly thrust competition back into the US launch marketplace. You didn‚Äôt have to work for ULA on iterative improvements to a proven design. You could go to SpaceX and do interesting work on new and novel rockets and rocket concepts.\n\nThe balanced retro-thrust return was a huge deal because it was new and exciting. This was new, challenging tech that their engineers got to work (mostly).  They‚Äôre launching ISS crews from America again, for the first time since the shuttle. They‚Äôre launching hundreds of new, novel satellites in a huge constellation (though the designs started a bit meh and are ass for ground-based telescopes, which the rocketry space nerds do not like because we stick with the astronomy type space nerds).  They launched a car for a vanity project.  They want to start sending people to the Moon and Mars.\n\nAnd behind it all was Elon Musk, a very public figure. He was the man that made being an aerospace engineer with a focus on space fun and exciting again.  He brought space launches back into the public psyche.\n\nMy school years in the 2000s had seen newspapers and magazines filled with think pieces about whether the age of manned space flight would end with the end of ISS. ISS was too expensive, the discoveries were too small, the budgets were too big.  Let ISS die when funding ran out and stop sending up any astronauts, they‚Äôd argue.\n\nBut after I got out of AE for being utterly boring, Elon made it exciting again.  And that was huge. Heck, I personally regretted a decision to move out of aerospace engineering and into more biological focused pursuits.\n\nElon certainly has flaws, but he was the standard bearer of the sea change of space flight.  He‚Äôs both a driving force for a focus on space science and space engineering as a funder as well as the public figurehead of the push for the same.\n\n(And FYI, if you don‚Äôt believe me, believe the AIAA. in the early 2000s the AIAA was actually facing a crisis for the future - their projections of numbers of new aerospace engineers weren‚Äôt meeting the projections of the numbers needed between replacing retiring existing members and expected needs to continue to meet targets.  They needed young people to get excited about aerospace, so they started some big promotions for students to try to get them interested. They wanted a new generation of motivated engineers like they had gotten out of kids that looked at Apollo or the Shuttle and went ‚Äúwhoa, I want to do that!‚Äù And then followed through. But without an exciting new program for decades and none in the pipeline, it was bleak. For all some of the member companies of the AIAA might not like SpaceX (since they compete for contracts), Elon and SpaceX have basically solved the problem of finding and encouraging motivated new aerospace engineers.)",

The Shuttle boosters fell into the sea and needed total refurbishment before reuse, not saving much money. The Shuttle was a reusable rocket too, but an expensive one. But the whole system cost FAR more than anticipated, more than any regular rocket launch, over $50,000 per kilo to LEO. \n\nAnother question is launch cadence of reusable space launch vehicles. They're reusable, so a core of that concept is to be able to reuse them often. The Discovery has the highest launch history with 39 launches, but over 25 years. SpaceX recently nailed the tenth landing of the same rocket, and over only 26 months. The fastest Shuttle turnaround I can see is 2 1/2 months, while I see a couple Falcon 9s turned around in under a month.\n\nNASA kind of made it work but not with any cost savings or increased launch cadence. Musk really made it work with massive cost savings and a very fast launch cadence. He completely upended the space industry, allowing rapid launches at a far lower price. Roscosmos (Russia) and the ESA (Europe) are panicking because they simply can't compete right now. The ESA is especially reliant on overpriced launches from the governments that back it to keep it afloat right now, while SpaceX is enjoying a stream of paying clients from around the world. SpaceX does launch for the US government, but still at a much lower price than the traditional competition. \n\nI really don't think you can overrate these accomplishments. \n\nAnd then we have the Tesla cars. I'll even leave aside the fact that there are a lot of technological feats built into those cars. I looked at buying an electric car before the Tesla, and no thanks. Car makers made serious compromises in design, range, performance, and comfort to produce cars that nobody really likes, but maybe the more hardcore environmentalists would buy them. They were \"electric car\" curiosities, not just cars. \n\nTesla made a car that happened to be electric. It didn't look weird, it had good range,  awesome performance, and normal features and comfort. Finally an electric car the average person may want to buy! This jumpstarted the international electric car market, so that now almost every major manufacturer is on board, and the rate of ICE car replacement by electric is accelerating. Seriously, tell me 15 years ago there would be a nice, comfortable, mass-market, mid-sized electric sedan that had a 400 mile range and could blow the pants off a Ferrari, and I'd have laughed at you. \n\nWith this move Musk has probably done more to address climate change than any other single person in history.",

            "text": "I see a lot of posts here going on about the reusability aspect of the F9, but really, we should dig in to why no other manufacturers have offered this capability prior to SpaceX and wether the price difference between a recovered mission and a fully expandable one is significant for most customers.\nSo let's start with some facts:\n\n\nThe f9 full thrust can insert 5.5 tons into GTO at a price of 50 million dollars. This is the full launch cost including barge landing.\n\n\nThe f9 can carry 8.3 tons into GTO at a cost of 150 million dollars (if my sources are correct on this).\n\n\nThe f9 can insert 22.8 tons into LEO in expandable config at also 150 mio. dollars.\n\n\nThe f9 can insert 15.6 tons into LEO in reusable config at 50mio. dollars.\n\n\nLet's talk GTO first. \nAccording to euroconsultforecasts about 43% of commercial geostationary satellites weigh in at above 5.5 tons, so a expandable f9 config is necessary. This means that 43% will have to pay the full f9 price of 150 mio dollars for launch. So these companies won't really cut any costs compared to going with a spacex competitor (their launch prices are usuall in a simmiliar or even cheaper range for expandable flight).\n\n\nNow for the really lightweight GTO sattelites, those usually use rideshare services anyways. So for them, it's not the 100 million dollar difference between an expandable competitor and spacex reusable flight, it's rather a proportional saving, assuming a fully packed rideshare on a reusable F9. This is where SpaceX can potentially offer some advantage.\nAll in all, I'd estimate that SpaceX can offer a cheaper ride to maybe 50 GTO launches in a ten year timeframe.\n\n\nThen, we have LEO. I assume this is where most satellites will benefit from SpaceX, since these are usually much lighter. By doing some quick napkin math, a 100kg satellite launch rideshared on SpaceX will only cost a third compared to a launch on a competitor's vehicle.\n\n\nOverall, we should now estimate the number of satellites to be put into LEO in the next years. SpaceX itself will probably launch around 40k satellites. There are other companies announcing projects of around 100-200 satellites in LEO. I estimate we're looking at less than 50k satellites overall to be launched into LEO in the next decade. So really, without SpaceX's own imvestment into Starlink, there isn't really a competitive need for much cheaper launches that would make the RnD worth it for other companies.\n\n\nGoing trough all the trouble of making a reusable rocket just to offer a cheaper launch to around 50 geostationary and maybe another 50-100 LEO launches (5-10k sats in total) in a ten to twenty  year timeframe just makes no sense. \nFor SpaceX themselves, this is a much different picture because they plan on building Starlink. \n\n\nSo honestly I don't get the shitting on other launch companies. There just doesn't exist an open market large enough that would make reusable launches competitively reasonable. The F9 is an absolute masterpiece, but I think most people don't really get how small the spaceflight market really is excluding Starlink launches.\nThis analysis was very rough though, but I really don't see why any other manufacturer that doesn't want their own starlink should build a reusable vehicle.",

Which SpaceX attributes to flying a new fairing and a VAB for Falcon Heavy at LC-39A (I think) to vertically integrate the rocket instead of the current horizontal integration. The argument is that SpaceX shouldn't have the right to charge the DOD for the cost of the vertical assembly building because the only use for that building (right now) is DOD launches. Of course future DOD launches using this building won't have to pay the cost of building it since the building will have already been built.
