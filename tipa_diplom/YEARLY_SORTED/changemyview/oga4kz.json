    "CMV: Anyone should be able to opt out/leave a Home Owner's Association at any time\nI understand why HOAs exist and some people prefer them, and it's great (for those people) when everyone involved is on the same page and things go well.\n\nHowever, anyone that doesn't wish to be bound by the ever-changing rules of the ever-changing management in a HOA should absolutely be able to say, \"This is no longer something I wish to be associated with, I will no longer be paying any dues or abiding by any rules of this HOA.\" and stop their participation at any time.\n\nIt's a really simple CMV, not much more to it than \"You own a house, you have a right to do or not do what you want with that property, no nebulous private entity should ever be able to force you to do something with that property against your will.\"\n\nAnd maybe there's a super simple reason I'm missing why that would not be a good policy so...change my view!": [

            "text": "HOAs have a long and storied history. And most of that history is racist.\n\nMany people are bringing up home values and how neighbors with bad lawn and house care drive down the potential value of certain properties, and while there is clearly something to be said about maintaining a neighborhood, some of those very considerations of home care and property value are also the exact arguments used to drive minorities out of neighborhoods.\n\nIt's also incredibly classist. I'm guessing some of you have no idea how expensive some HOAs are, or how shit the housing market is right now. Not only do you have to pay the mortgage on your house, your taxes, repairs, maintenance, etc, BUT you have to pay HOA fees that do...what for you? HOAs are a metric to keep people who might be middle class out of affluent neighborhoods. Not only that, but saying \"you could just buy in a different neighborhood\" have no idea how hard that can be. The housing market is shrinking because of Boomers buying up property and renting it, not to mention low and stagnated wages among younger generations. Adding HOA fees is just another level of money keeping young people, POOR people, out. You can buy another house? Where? 2 hours away? Horse shit.\n\nNOW, for the CMV; While I think that modern HOAs are a racist, classist, abomination, I think that there are concepts about them that could be useful. I have no problem making the HOA covenant a part of home ownership, and mandatory, in certain neighborhoods, BUT I think there need to be restrictions put on the powers of those HOAs.\n\n***Benefits of an HOA:***\n\n1- *Local health and safety awareness and policing.* I think that building communities is important, and a basic community safety measures are absolutely a reasonable use of an HOA. For example, limiting the planting of invasive species, reporting of improper safety around attractive nuisances, etc. It might not be illegal in the city to have a pool without a wildlife escape ramp, but an HOA would be an acceptable and easy way for the neighborhood to require something like that. In areas like California, converting lawns to low water use gardens is a vital change that HOAs could be using their power for.\n\n2- *Establishment of community facilities for the use of the neighborhood.* A big example of this would be something like a neighborhood pool, but a smaller more simple version would be doggie poop bag stands and disposal posts, placed around the neighborhood. Instead of trying to catch every single person letting their dog poop on the lawns, just provide accessible doggy bags.\n\n3- *Community chest improvement funds.* Instead of making demands of people and their funds, if communities want certain improvements to their neighborhood, why not fund them together? Instead of ostracizing lower income homeowners, help them by building neighborhood fund pools. This years fund will go to external house repainting. You are not required to repaint your house, but if you choose to, present the quote and dates to your HOA and you will be reimbursed by a certain grant amount.\n\n***Necessary HOA restrictions***\n\n1- *Membership fees MUST be capped.* HOAs with membership fees in the hundreds of dollars are crap. The administrative costs of an HOA need to be publicly available and fees capped to a percentage of the appraised value of the home. An HOA fee should never be more than, say 10% of your mortgage. (If you paid off the mortgage, the amount would be equal to an appraised mortgage rate.)\n\n2- *No arbitrary aesthetic policing.* No one cares about the color of your neighbors house. If you live in a neighborhood where your neighbor painting their front door red is going to drop your value by 50k, you live in a neighborhood where housing values are more than $500,000 and it functionally doesn't matter. If you live in a house worth **HALF A MILLION** then either no one cares about your neighbor's house, or you have enough wealth to afford that house, that a loss in value isn't enough to matter. Other policies like yard care/length should be implemented by #2/3 community use funds. Care about the neighbor's lawn? The HOA should pay for a monthly lawn service to cut lawns. Guess how many lawns will remain uncut for longer than a month?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy removing most penalties, and using community programs, support, and facilities as incentive, you could have all the benefits of an HOA, without the racism/sexism/classism and bullying that is part of the current model. Within communities, the buy in would still be mandatory in order to promote community involvement, but in this case I think the benefit out weighs the few times a homeowner might not want to participate in a particular program.",

The deed restriction required that only the oak trees that needed to be removed for construction could be cut down.

I don't want to take away any one else's freedom, I just want to live in a neighborhood where people prioritize the same things as me, and agree to live to certain standards.\n\nFor subdivisions, I think the benefits of an HOA has to do with scale too. On a quarter acre lot on a cul-de-sac, a bright green door, or a 35' 5th wheel camper in someone's driveway just dominates the whole view. In an area with acre or bigger lots, it's usually not a big deal, as percentage wise, those things take up much less of the view and you can usually put that camper or boat in a side or backyard. When everyone lives closer together, a few more rules can help everyone get along better.\n\nI love my HOA.  Somewhat expensive at $350/month, but it covers lawn care, swimming pool, tennis court, and boat slip.  Having community lawncare makes it so everyone's yard is maintained the same way. We really have a park like atmosphere. There are standard architectural guidelines, but there aren't any bizarre rules, like what color your curtains can be, etc., so it's been 95% positive experience in my 8yrs experience. Sure, there's been some politics involved, and there's always going to be disputes with the way money is spent, but you really can't avoid that aspect when you are spending group money.\n\nSo to the original comment about being able to back-out of the HOA.. I don't think that would be fair to all the people who wanted to live in a neighborhood where everyone agreed to follow the same rules.

You cannot alter that easement because it doesn't belong to you; it belongs to your neighbor. \n\nThis is exactly what is happening when you buy a property in a development where there is an HOA.

If I don't own my walls, then how do I get to own my walls? Do I have to buy the HOA out? Who sets the value? What about the fact that many row homes aren't built to be independent like that? For example, many row homes have a public back yard that's communally owned, and that's important because I can't reasonably use my backyard if my neighbors put up some giant fence or wall. But there's no way to compel them to stop building those structures without an HOA.\n\nOr in some row homes, units have to do things like share communal outdoor faucets to water the backyard. It's a cost-savings measure b/c it's cheaper than installing dozens of faucets when in reality you'll never have all of them in use. So you just install a faucet maybe every other unit, maybe between them.\n\nWhen I buy the walls out, am I buying the faucet? Because I could be a righteous bastard and deny my neighbor the faucet use, or I could tell him I'm charging him $20/day to water his lawn.\n\nRoof crawl space is also often communal. There are no internal walls build between units, because the area isn't meant to be lived in or for storage. It's often just a maintenance access space. But again, if I go private and build interior walls and shit, I can lock work crews out of certain spaces. Maybe then I say, \"I'll let you through... for $100.\" Or maybe they just tell me, go fuck yourself. You can rip the whole goddam roof off and pay for it at your own expense.

            "text": "i think the problem is in the extrapolation of the principle. an h.o.a is no much different than a city, just smaller and a little less authoritative (less power, fewer guns, no jails). should you also be able to say i don't want to obey the ever-changing laws of the city and simply succeed from the city? should an h.o.a be able to do that to a city? should a city be able to do that to a county? should the county be able to do that to a state/province? should a state/province be able to do that to a nation?\n\nit is an interesting question, i think the answer to that question (at least in significant part) lies in how you feel about the fundamental purpose of human communities and the practical ability to succeed from those communities due to the power and motivation they hold and their ability to use that power to enforce membership.\n\nit is thangentally important to understand that human collectives are natural, the community is even encoded in our very d.n.a to a great extent. communities form because they provide the members with protections not possible to individuals. all the people of the community lend to its defense, usually in an organized way. with that in mind, it is fully appropriate that any member of a community be forced to participate in its defense. logically i do not see how you could avoid at least some rule-changing given changes in threatening circumstances. this makes some changing rules appropriate and even essential to the fundamental function and existence of the community upon which the members of the community rely for their very lives. it is this principle of mutual defense that allows for peace and space for nonviolent progress. \n\nwhen an h.o.a forms it must have a charter (a constitution of sorts), when people buy into that community they do so with an awareness of that charter and agree to abide by its foundational principles. insofar as the ever-changing rules of that h.o.a work to fulfill that charter and never exceed or violate that charter without universal consent then you have no right to disobey those rules. indeed, if you were to violate those rules or attempt to succeed from that union you could be in violation of the property rights of every other member of that community who chose to enter into that union under the specific conditions with specific borders.\n\nthat being said, if the new rules exceed the constitution or are contrary to the constitution of the community then it is fully appropriate for you to succeed or even to use violence in defense of the foundational principles of the community.\n\neven so, you still have the issue of practicality which you admit to if only subconsciously. when you say anyone \"should be able to\" you acknowledge that the use of force makes succession currently impractical. to obtain that power you must appeal to the organization who holds the power and the motivation to restrain you. in your case you must either convince the h.o.a or the larger, more powerful, organization that enforces the h.o.a rules. without the practicality, you will never be making anything more than a useless assertion.",

It's not like Thomas Jefferson woke up one day, and said, out of nowhere, \"property means you do whatever you want with it\". Instead, this is just a tiny little part of a larger, interconnected system of ideas, which, as a whole, form Capitalism.\n\nCapitalism comes as one package. When you try to take little pieces and apply them out of context, things go wrong. The reason why Capitalism works is because of the underlying principles of it (which are built on pretty much our entire history, as humans), not because little pieces like this one are absolute, universal truths.\n\nAnd, before we even get into what Capitalism is, we should establish what its purpose is. The purpose of Capitalism is to govern interactions in a society in a way that avoids violence and coercion, and promotes peaceful, voluntary cooperation.\n\nThis is a VERY DIFFICULT goal. As many ancient cultures found out, it's not as simple as declaring \"thou shalt not steal or murder\", and that's it. Because that rule would have to be enforced by someone...and that someone has to use force to enforce it. And then that person would have absolute power over society, and resolve every dispute however he sees fit (like the \"wise\" King Solomon threatening to cut a baby in half). And Solomon is one of the positive examples, things usually go worse than that:)\n\nEventually, through thousands of years of incremental improvements (and all kinds of setbacks, as well), we've arrived at a system which is essentially a combination of rights and contracts which form a consistent set of rules, which can then be enforced objectively and predictably by the justice system (as opposed to arbitrarily, like King Solomon used to do). But rights and contracts are both necessary. You can't have peaceful cooperation just with one. You can't make long term plans based on rights, without contracts. \n\nIn this example, it's obvious why: how can someone build a family home on a piece of property, if the property owner next to him has the \"right\", at any time, to turn their property into a chicken farm (I don't know if you ever passed by one of those, if you have, you know why that wouldn't be good), Before you can make such a plan, you have to agree to a contract, which facilitates your long term plans. \n\nAnd that contract is whatever the people who sign it agree to. Freely. If you don't like how a HOA works, don't agree to one. Don't buy into one. Buy a house that's not covered by one. That's the beauty of Capitalism: you and like minded individuals have the right to set your own rules. If you don't like the usual way a HOA works, write up a different contract. One that's not as flexible or as wide in scope, for example. One that only limits certain activities (like a chicken farm), but doesn't interfere with others (like a garden in the front yard).",

A homeowner has the right to do what they want with the land and building they own but they also deserve the right to protect its value, which an unsightly neighbor can effect. It’s not fair for a home I purchased in a good neighborhood to depreciate in value because the guy next door doesn’t think he needs to mow his lawn or take his trash bins all the way to the curb where the garbage men will actually take it away instead of leaving it where it lays. HOAs exist to curb that sort of nonsense. If any hoarder could just opt out and decide the rules don’t apply to them they can have a real effect on the finances of their more responsible neighbors. Not to insult people with that specific problem, I understand it’s a mental disease and I sympathize but it’s a genuine issue I’ve encountered. It’s not unreasonable to demand a certain standard from your neighborhood to protect your investment so long as you’re also willing to toe the line. As long as the regulations don’t cross the line and become more pleasing to some individual’s aesthetic taste for no reason other than placating them the HOA is a benefit to everyone and an option to simply withdraw yourself screws over everyone who remains.",

The pay period rolls around, and your employer states \"Oh, I changed the contract. You're now paid every three months.\"\n\nAll parties didn't agree to that change.

We also have racist land covenants banning certain races from owning property, thankfully no longer of legal effect. Mostly the equivalent of an HOA’s rules are implemented with municipal bylaws requiring grass cutting and not storing junk on the property. Noise bylaws are enforced the same way, with bylaw officers who respond to complaints. These are implemented with a light touch. Most people try to match the expectations of their neighbours and have similar landscaping. There are no petty rules as municipal bylaws will apply equally to all 500-100000 houses in the same city. You can’t opt out of municipal bylaws. However you can move to other cities or to the other side of town where people are less judgemental. Enforcement is done by municipal workers who are paid well - they are all unionized. So the implication is that you want to not sell your house but no longer be subject to the rules. Well, I think a privately run HOA is an abomination and you should press your state government to eliminate them. However they should be replaced by municipal guidelines applied city wide, implemented impartially by fat well paid government workers who are not in anyone’s pocket.",

They were originally designed to be owned, ran, managed, enforced, and changed by the individuals in the communities. Therefore you're supposed to be able to encourage your HOA to change it's rules if you don't agree with them, but only if the community also agrees with you. \n\nYou can think of HOA's as a \"mini-government\", or a country club. The group comes together, creates a list of rules/regulations that everyone (or majority) agrees on, and then everyone follows these rules. If 1 person doesn't follow these rules then there is zero point in having these rules, and zero point in having the HOA. So opting out of an HOA would make zero sense, because someone could just not want to keep care of their property and let it go to crap. \n\nImagine if your neighbor decided to never mow their lawn, wash their windows, clean up their dog crap, let their trash pile up and never get collected, let sketchy individuals just hangout in front of their house (gang members, drug dealers, homeless, whatever), and more. You would feel upset that your property was being impacted by the fact that your neighbor wasn't tending to their property. \n\nCommunities can always disband an HOA if they get enough support from the neighbors, but the bigger the HOA is, or the bigger the community is, the harder it becomes.\n\nFor context: I don't agree with HOAs, and I despise them. HOA's are starting to become managed by companies and corporations, and when that starts being a thing it is never good.
