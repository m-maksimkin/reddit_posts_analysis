            "text": "If the fetus is alive and afforded full human rights than yes it does matter, because at a certain point the fetus's right to life does supersede the mother's autonomy.  In cases of rape, coercion, contraceptive failure there is a real argument to be made that the mother can abort in self defense, pregnancy is dangerous even with our medical technology, and especially in cases of inadvertantly becoming pregnant or rape the risk of severe post partum depression and indeed suicide is a real concern and threat.  The fetus can still be alive and still have full rights, and still be aborted in self defense, obviously if we had the ability to just warp babies out of the womb and put them in an artificial one you should, just as you can defend yourself if someone attacks you with a knife, but if you have a phaser and can set it to stun or kill, most would agree just going to kill wouldn't be justifiable, because both the baby and the knife wielder still have a right to life despite threatening someone else's, and that right is only superseded by extreme necessity.  However in cases where the mother has intentionally created life the self defense argument no longer holds much water, if someone went to a protected preserve in Africa and started poking lions until one attacked him so he can legally shoot it in self defense, I think basically everyone would agree that the hunter is at fault for creating the situation, similar to the classic example of forcing someone at gun point to pick up a gun and then shooting them in \"self defense\".  Now I will note that there isn't really a way to prove someone's intentions when they walk through the doors at an abortion clinic so in practical matters at our current societal and technological level abortion should be accessible, but that's more due to limits on practical measures not the sort of philosophical right or wrong most abortion debates fall under.  Ultimately I think most people would agree that bodily autonomy doesn't defacto trump right to life, if there were some hypothetical situation where someone was kidnapped and told I'm going to break your finger and then let you go, and we knew for 100% certainty that they would only have a finger broken, it would be pretty over the top and probably illegal to just shoot the kidnapper, because ultimately just bodily autonomy and mitigation of temporary harm isn't enough to justify killing someone. Now in the real world when someone is threatening to rape you or attack you, you don't know if it will escalate further, the harm is not guaranteed to be non lethal, etc, but those are justifications for escalating to self defense that are not tied to pure bodily autonomy, because bodily autonomy alone is not enough to justify taking away the most basic and primal of our rights, to live, the right that is sort of inherently the most important to protect because all other ones ultimately are reliant on both parties being alive.  \n\n\n\n\nAgain at our current technological and societal level a lot of this is more ephemeral impractical stuff that doesn't really matter in a debate about pure public policy, but to just say that the fetus being alive doesn't matter wholesale is wrong, it does matter, we just have enough reasons to supersede it's rights at the moment, but ultimately public policy and should be worked towards solving this issue in favour of fetuses.  Now I certainly agree that they aren't alive at many of the debated stages of life, but at a certain point we do consider them alive and at that point these concerns and justifications become very important, because no bodily autonomy isn't a catch-all justification for all abortions.",

This equipment uses a lot of fuel - I don't wanna burn an hours worth of gas just so my buddy gets to look at the coral... screw him... he won't even pay me back. Plus its boring up here watching the air pump and there's other things I'd like to do.\"\nSo you shut down the pump and walk away.\nPredictably, your busy drowns. \n\nAnalogy 2:\nYou take a walk along the pier, and see a random scuba diver set his equipment up and dive solo. Nobody diving partner. His pump just ran out of fuel. Now, there's a gas can right beside it... you could save the guys life by running over and filling it up. But you don't know him,  and it isn't your really your job, so you decide to mind your own business and keep walking.\n\nIn my opinion, in both scenarios, the person is despicable. But only in the first is the guy guilty of homicide. Failing to intervene to save someone is not murder in my opinion.\n\nUNLESS you are responsible for setting up the circumstances in which intervening  to save a life is necessary, as in scenario 1.\n\nWith pregnancy,  your choices set up the situation , so it is most like scenario 1.\n\nGranted, playing host to a fetus inside your body is a much bigger ask than continuing to run the air pump.

Unfortunately, it's not as simple as that considering their view as to when it becomes a life of value is not universally shared.

The right should understand this since they support th death penalty, and any carnivore sustains themself through the taking of life.\n\nAbortion is tragic for everyone involved, but it's one of life's many tragedies that we can't wish away or pretend is avoidable.

There might be a moral argument that we should feel obligated to give blood in emergency. However, others are not entitled to those resources. That said, the comparison to a fetus is unconvincing. Rather than being asked to give to someone unrelated, it is a person that was brought into being by actions of the mother (in most cases exempting rape). In comparison to the classic violinist thought experiment. What if the donor had brought about the situation. Should they be expected to contribute then, to what extent?\n2. Sure, I guess.. There is some moral question about ideal conditions for the baby. Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should or that its optimal. But that's a technological problem.\n3. This is a poorly constructed comparison. No matter how you cut it, pregnancy is a possibility during penetrative sex. It is an action that two parties consent to with the consequences. Most pro-life advocates will concede the exemption in cases of rape while still maintaining that the fetus is innocent and the act is still wrong. The problem with your comparison is the relative morality of the actors in the two scenarios. In the case of rape, there is a clear immoral actor who destroys the agency of the victim there is no consent to the act or consequences. In normal intercourse, the two parties accept the risks associated with their actions. \n\nI'm not sure I addressed your main argument though that the fetus being \"alive\" matters. I would challenge that statement in that the state of being matters greatly to a person's moral standing or the moral standing of most things. In being alive as a human, albeit a dependent one, the pro-life position is that the fetus has immutable human value. That is the value which can be built upon but nonetheless exists with every human. \n\nThe point being that the fetus being alive is incredibly relevant in that human value primarily resides with human life. Trying to put a timeline on when that human value exists is difficult and fraught with philosophical pitfalls. Similarly, the claim that we don't owe anyone anything is a questionable assertion. Then the question becomes, if through the course of freely made decisions, a woman brings about the existence of human life (\"alive\"), \"does she have obligation to provide bodily resources?\", thus compromising bodily autonomy. The pro-life position says yes, it is an obligation. The pro-choice position says no, it can only be a gift free from obligation and can be withdrawn whether or not the fetus has moral standing.",

Let’s say that safely removing the fetus for incubation is a slightly longer process than an abortion (say, 1 hour), and the mother decides that she doesn’t want to wait that extra bit of time to remove the fetus from her body. In this case, since bodily autonomy is the dominant right in question, the mother can decide to abort DESPITE the option to incubate; in order to protect her right to bodily autonomy for a measly one hour. \n\nIf we find this result too extreme, that would show that the absolute dominance of bodily autonomy as a right is unacceptable, and that it must be balanced against other rights.",

I can find the exact law but providing life support is definitely one of the terms included in the duty of care of a parent. And you will be hard pressed to find me a school of philosophy that doesnt believe a parent has a duty of sustenance towards their child.\n\nNow, I suppose you could come from the point of \"but it doesnt say I have to give my blood\"and go down the route of how much self-sacrifice you have to take for your children to morally be justified in letting them die.\n\nBearing in mind that while pregnancy is surely a very arduous experience.. is the  sacrifice asked greater than the duty of care a parent has? But that is a whole other can of worms.\n\nBut specifically  because you  said \"or life support to another human being\" the statement is in principle wrong because parents do have a duty of care for life support and to keep their child alive. \n\nEdit:\n\n>Parents have a duty of care to ensure their children’s needs are met. Duty of care is a legal requirement which parents have to provide to their dependent, as society expects that parents must meet the needs of those who are under their care. The welfare of the child is most important and hence parents have legal position as both guardian and custodian to ensure the wellbeing of the dependent is being met. To further encourage parents to fulfil their responsibilities of providing their dependent with duty of care, the government have enacted legislations such as Children (Care and Protection) Act 1987 (NSW) and Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 (NSW).\n\nExample of duty of care laws in Australia.

            "text": "1. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe if we assume a fetus is \"alive\" (which to me indicates an equivalency to a newborn child) then the fetus's guardian is legally obligated to care for him/her. As far as sacrificing their own body by some means, I think it's actually a false equivalency to say that there was something \"put\" inside of her is the same thing as being forced to donate her body to support someone else with blood, organs, etc. I could make the argument that when she consented to having the semen \"put\" into her body, she is also consenting to the possibility of that growing into a child and therefore taking on legal responsibility to protect that life (assuming, once again, that the fetus is indeed alive as much as a birthed child is)\n2. Legally speaking, I don't have much of an issue with this. Regardless though, they must have a legal guardian of some sort, whether it's the mother or not. And to continue my point from #1 - that person is obligated to take care of them.\n3. I absolutely disagree with this. Sex directly causes pregnancy - it is its biological intended purpose. The same way we can look at a gun and know that it's intended purpose is to expel a bullet at high velocity to damage a target. One does not go outside in public with the intention of being raped. That said, yes, there are things that can be done to prevent this and it is up to women to employ those methods. But as you say, unfortunately there are things that still end up to women becoming pregnant such as rape. But as you say, if we are going to consider a fetus a life, then regardless of the means by which that life was brought into existence, it must be protected. As you say, technology could remove the responsibility of carrying to term for the mother which is fine with me. (I'll go into more detail in #4 on this) But yes, some women DO gleefully go through abortions. You can find plenty of examples of people bragging about it on Twitter and other places, though I guess you'd have to define what you mean by \"gleefully\" to be fair. (I can try to find examples of what I mean if you want - I've seen it many times)\n4. I agree and disagree with this. I think you make a good point that if responsibility on the mother could be taken away this way, then the question of murder via abortion effectively goes away. But the debate itself right now isn't about that - it's about whether a fetus is a life at all.   \nAnd I think the point of your technological idea probably assumes that abortions would then not be necessary? Correct me if I'm wrong. IF this is what you're saying - we're then left to the next part of the abortion debate which is \"Assuming we do force women to carry children to term, what happens to the child afterwards?\" This is the one of the topics that comes up with abortion in general, and is left unresolved by this technology.",

The main thing at least to me is that these fetuses have stronger right to life than the 12th week embryos and there is strong justification for the woman to be forced to carry the fetus further in the pregnancy unless there are other overriding reasons (like mother's own life being in danger).",

How does the argument go from here? Something like this, I take it. Every person has a right to life. So the fetus has a right to life. No doubt the mother has a right to decide what shall happen in and to her body; everyone would grant that. But surely a person's right to life is stronger and more stringent than the mother's right to decide what happens in and to her body, and so outweighs it. So the fetus may not be killed; an abortion may not be performed. It sounds plausible. But now let me ask you to imagine this. You wake up in the morning and find yourself back to back in bed with an unconscious violinist. A famous unconscious violinist. He has been found to have a fatal kidney ailment, and the Society of Music Lovers has canvassed all the available medical records and found that you alone have the right blood type to help. They have therefore kidnapped you, and last night the violinist's circulatory system was plugged into yours, so that your kidneys can be used to extract poisons from his blood as well as your own. The director of the hospital now tells you, \"Look, we're sorry the Society of Music Lovers did this to you--we would never have permitted it if we had known. But still, they did it, and the violinist is now plugged into you. To unplug you would be to kill him. But never mind, it's only for nine months. By then he will have recovered from his ailment, and can safely be unplugged from you.\" Is it morally incumbent on you to accede to this situation? No doubt it would be very nice of you if you did, a great kindness. But do you have to accede to it? What if it were not nine months, but nine years? Or longer still? What if the director of the hospital says. \"Tough luck. I agree. but now you've got to stay in bed, with the violinist plugged into you, for the rest of your life. Because remember this. All persons have a right to life, and violinists are persons. Granted you have a right to decide what happens in and to your body, but a person's right to life outweighs your right to decide what happens in and to your body. So you cannot ever be unplugged from him.\" I imagine you would regard this as outrageous, which suggests that something really is wrong with that plausible-sounding argument I mentioned a moment ago.* -- Full text and argument here: https://spot.colorado.edu/~heathwoo/Phil160,Fall02/thomson.htm Note: if anyone wants to argue with JJT in my direction, that's fine but please **read the full paper before you do**. Folks often read the first little bit and then go, \"Oh but what about consent!!\" and don't read how JJT discusses issues like this. \n\nJJT, however, ends her argument in a way that speaks to the discussion at hand: *At this place, however, it should be remembered that we have only been pretending throughout that the fetus is a human being from the moment of conception. A very early abortion is surely not the killing of a person, and so is not dealt with by anything I have said here.* Why does she say this? From your stated perspective, this is an irrelevant aside; no need to even note it. But it's not irrelevant because it affects the *philosophical justification* for abortion. It doesn't change the end conclusion for very early abortions -- a bodily autonomy perspective on abortion and a \"fetus is not a person\" perspective would both lead to the conclusion \"early abortions are A-Okay\". Bit does affect the *thinking* and the *meaning*. Unplugging a violinist is a serious issue-- it is ethically allowed (says JJT and, presumably, you) but it is still very substantive and serious. Unplugging a non-person is not a serious issue at all-- I'm not in the least concerned about pulling off a blood clot that someone attached to me. For that reason alone, it is not reasonable to conclude that a fetus being \"alive\" is *irrelevant*. It's relevant. It's a worthy topic of discussion, even though you can be pro-choice either way.",

            "text": "I agree with some of your points, but I take some issue with the broad summary that the life of a fetus is irrelevant. Sensitive issues like abortion rarely get the nuanced debate they deserve, and most people who have strong opinions boil it down to a few talking points. The pro-life argument seems to be rooted in two things based on what I hear all the time.\n\n1. Pro-lifers use religion to argue for the sinful or immoral act of abortion.\n2. Most of us may agree that a) we would all take issue killing a baby right after it's born and b) we take very little to no issue with a woman losing 1000s of her eggs a year in menstrual cycles and every jack and joe shooting millions of sperm into a tissue every day. These two defensible positions make what seems like an obvious choice to place the argument somewhere in the middle. When does life take place after conception? What trimester is acceptable period for abortion? Everything that seems to matter in this debate takes place in the 9 month period between conception and birth, and pro-lifers generally refuse to acknowledge the external circumstances leading into pregnancy (e.g. health risk factors, fetus development issues, rape, etc). \n\nIf I have think about it in terms of the fetus and what rights it should have, I'll admit that this is a tough thought process. In fact, I feel like everyone should feel conflicted about how we look at the creation of life, how we determine when it deserves protections, and what consequences arise from making a choice as a society one way or the other. \n\nSo, I think it's limiting to say that the life of a fetus is irrelevant, but that leads me into what I believe is the core issue in the debate which is moral consequence. I don't believe we can find a solution for abortion that mitigates moral consequence as a society. Abortion carries heavy consequences, not just to the fetus, but to the mother carrying it, however carrying a fetus through to term despite risky or horrific external factors ALSO carries consequences. They're unavoidable either way, and we can't satisfy the moral expectations of a society by assuming there is one consequence-free solution for a complex issue.\n\nSo, this is where we have to weigh the moral consequences and pick the one that causes the least amount of damage. Pro-life only provides one solution to this problem: abortion is illegal and too bad so sad for women. Pro-choice allows us (as a society) to handle this subject with discretion on a case-by-case basis, and it makes the most sense to put the moral burden on the individuals whose bodily autonomy is at stake in the first place. In other words, no one other than a mother should be making this choice, because no one has to suffer with the consequences as much as a mother making that choice has to. \n\nI can't imagine there's a single woman out there who has gone through an abortion who wasn't emotionally or mentally affected in a major way. No one WANTS to make that choice, but we don't get guarantees that there's always going to be an easy choice from two options. At least with pro-life, there ARE two options. \n\nProblem is, we can't have nuanced discussions because the half of society that believes in pro-life is also the same half that can't spell and thought the guy from The Apprentice would be an effective president. The obvious better candidate was a woman of course.\n\nTLDR: The only reasonable option here is a pro-choice stance, but I disagree that the \"aliveness\" of a fetus is irrelevant. Your points are more or less spot on though.",

Even those who live lives of suffering or poverty or homelessness or even those who are neglected by their parents still want to live.   \n\n\nWhen it comes to utility, at least the utility of preference, the preference to not endure18-22 years of inconvenience (major or otherwise) can never outweigh the preference of a human living, because, if that were to be disregarded, all possible preferences of that person would all be disregarded, and that cannot outweigh the years of the parent's life.   \n\n\n>For those who support the argument that having sex risks pregnancy, this is equivalent to saying that appearing in public risks rape.\n\nThis isn't true. The likelihood that the antecedent to being raped is purely going outside is astronomically low, thus responsibility isn't an issue here. By definition, rape is non consensual, the mother of the child is stripped of that autonomy and thus is not responsible for having been raped. The preference of the mother to not endure that mental trauma is not outweighed by a man's want of 2 minutes of pleasure. \n\nHowever, in the case of sex, consensual or otherwise, there is no want or preference that can outweigh the wants and preferences (plural) that the child will have.   \n\n\nAll of this is assuming the woman's life isn't in serious risk, if it were, abortion can be a morally righteous action here.",

If I’m right, then to your argument, the life of the fetus doesn’t matter—but a lot of people in the abortion debate, at least half, don’t frame it that way. In fact, anti-abortion people are *loudly* of the opinion that a woman's ability to control her own body is less important than the right of a child to be born. \n\nThere are a number of cases in which governments prioritize \"life\" over \"consent\"—the draft, taxes to pay for social services, vaccine mandates in countries that have them, gun control, etc. Even if you don’t agree with those things, the moral calculus remains the same with abortion: People who believe a fetus is alive see the issue as “this child’s right to live outweighs this mother’s right to control her body.” People who don’t see the fetus as alive tend to be more on the consent side of the argument.

This is because when you are confronted aggressively you defend your position wether physical or intellectual. To me it appears you have done exactly this, you have started using examples to prove your case that are right but irrelevant. For example removing the fetus from the body and keeping it alive is not possible or extremely unlikely based on timeline of the pregnancy due to technological limitation and arguing something that is not possible and could never be possible doesn’t hold relevance to the argument. \n\nPoint number one you said they have no obligation and I agree but you have worded it so weirdly that it sounds like the argument lacks all empathy. It is also very easy to misinterpret your agreement because it is vague and non specific. The issue with the argument is that the fetus has no say in the matter but you do have a say in having sex and not using contraception (I understand this is not 100% preventative but it is at least very effective) and thus you should be aware of the consequences of your actions. Your choices have led to the current situation (not including cases of rape), the fetus had no say in the matter at all. So wether it is living and classed as a human being is relevant because once they are living then their life is as sacred as your own. But this is very very hard because the definition of life is subjective and not well defined. \n\nAs for point 3 I completely agree sometimes you can do everything to avoid and pregnancy but it still happens and rapes still happen. But not everybody does use all the methods available to them to reduce the risk of pregnancy, and then have an abortion. Not that it is wrong it is your body and your choice. But it is also worth noting that all of your actions in life have consequences regardless of what you do and some situations have no way to fix them, abortion is a blessing and I think having children that are unwanted is hard on both the child and parent in that situation. But I would like to argue a different perspective on this, if you swap blood, tissue, organs etc out with resources which is basically what you are doing during pregnancy then your augment is  essentially that nobody should have to provide the resources for another person or should they feel obligated to do so. Which I guess could be understood as men don’t have to provide resources for a child they didn’t want because they don’t want it in the first place (even if they tried everything possible to avoid getting the women pregnant). Which I think is clearly not an accepted argument, you can’t have it both ways I understand women go through a lot physically and mentally during pregnancy and that shouldn’t be downplayed but if it is unfair to force one person to provide resources to another human being it is unfair to force anybody to provide for another human being. Essentially what I am saying is your action have consequences, if you don’t want a child and are dead set against it that is fine but if abortion wasn’t an option then not having sex would be the only way to guarantee you don’t have one. So I would argue that there is a point that the fetus is considered alive and from that point you should be held accountable for the consequences of your actions, in the case of rape I think the accountability can be waved and more leeway given.",

Firstly, it's not clear what you mean by \"alive\", or by putting that word inside quotation marks.\n\nThere is of course an uninteresting sense in which a foetus is alive: it has a heartbeat or a set DNA or whatever other technical definition you want to use. I agree that this is irrelevant, precisely because that is a technicality.\n\nBut whether the foetus counts in some sense as a *moral person* (is alive as person whose value/worth derives from its nature as a person, rather than e.g. as an object of love for the parents), now *that* is completely relevant.\n\nI can illustrate that with an example. Imagine that my brother, who for the sake of the example is the best person to have ever lived, needs a kidney to live, and only I can give it. In case 1, my brother is braindead and has zero hope of becoming conscious again, but giving the kidney will extend his vegetative \"life\" and please my parents who wish to see him in his unconscious state in the hospital. In case 2, my brother is alive and kicking, but will die without the kidney. Putting aside the legal aspect, on a moral level, do you think I would be a good person if I refused to donate the kidney? Is the answer to that question different in case 1 versus in case 2? If so, then that suggests that whether a foetus is alive is relevant on a moral level.\n\nI think it's obvious that under a certain level of development, a foetus doesn't have value as a person. Under a certain age, the foetus barely has a brain, doesn't have consciousness or a personality, doesn't have hopes and dreams; it is pure potential, and in that manner it is not fundamentally different from an unfertilized egg that results from using contraception. BUT a pretty solid case can be made that a 7 month-old fetus has enough brain activity to count as a kind of diminished person, and this is the reason why abortion laws, almost everywhere, define a time limit that comes into play before the foetus is viable. \n \n>A woman has no obligation to provide blood, tissue, organs, or life support to another human being, nor is she obligated to put anything inside of her to protect other human beings.\n\nThere are several situations when a human is supposed to provide assistance to other human beings. The most frequent one is parenthood: a parent is supposed, morally and by law, to devote their time and energy to raise their children. In doing so many parents will experience adverse health outcomes due to exertion. Although the body is considered a special case in law, because legislation needs to draw these kinds of arbitrary limits, on a moral level there is no real difference.\n\n>If a fetus can be removed and placed in an incubator and survive on its own, that is fine.\n\nSure. But what if the fetus has a 50/50 chance of surviving in the incubator? What if this damages the development of the fetus, resulting in a child with a physical or mental handicap? This is not so easy.\n\n>For those who support the argument that having sex risks pregnancy, this is equivalent to saying that appearing in public risks rape. \n\nThat is absolutely not equivalent. There actually are people who are irresponsible when having sex, and blaming them for it is not comparable to blaming rape victims for their own rape. I do agree that \"punishing a woman with motherhood\" is messed up.\n\n>Abortion is a debate limited by technological advancement. \n\nSure.

A woman has no obligation to provide blood, tissue, organs, or life support to another human being, nor is she obligated to put anything inside of her to protect other human beings.\n\nThis is not true.  Mothers are required by law to provide nutrition to their children, and I imagine if breast milk were the only option, they'd be required to provide it.  They are also generally required to continue with pregnancy at viability or, in some states, sooner, yes?  So your statement does not hold up to legal obligation.\n\nIf you mean no moral obligation, on what authority are you basing these morals?  What you think is morally right for a mother to provide to her child might not be what the person next to you thinks is morally right.\n\nConsider also that in a complex scenario where a person's actions resulted in an innocent someone being temporarily dependent on them, you might not take the same stance that you have no obligation to help them.  An example I like to use -- let's say you and a child are walking by a ladder with a bucket of extremely strong adhesive sitting at the top. *You* bump the ladder.  The bucket falls on you and the child, and you got glued together.  You were lucky - the child is only glued to your arm.  However, the child is glued to your arm at their neck.  Forcibly removing them would kill them.  Should you be obligated to keep the child attached to you until they can be safely removed, considering you were the one to bump the ladder, and the child did absolutely nothing wrong?\n\n>2. If a fetus can be removed and placed in an incubator and survive on its own, that is fine.\n\nNot sure how this relates to your statement that being alive is irrelevant.\n\n>3. For those who support the argument that having sex risks pregnancy, this is equivalent to saying that appearing in public risks rape. Women have the agency to protect against pregnancy with a slew of birth control options (including making sure that men use protection as well), morning after options, as well as being proactive in guarding against being raped. Despite this, unwanted pregnancies will happen just as rapes will happen. No woman gleefully goes through an abortion.\n\nThis is a false equivalence fallacy.  While you could argue \"having sex\" and \"appearing in public\" are equivalent because both are your own decisions, \"pregnancy\" and \"rape\" are not equivalent because one is the consequence of your own decisions (assuming consensual sex) and one is the consequence of someone else's decision.\n\nI'm not sure what point you were trying to make here though. People are generally responsible for the consequences of the risks they take.  If you accidentally destroy someone's property, you have to pay for it.  If you accidentally attach a child to your body, you have to see them safely removed, if that is an option (see glue scenario).\n\n>4. Abortion is a debate limited by technological advancement. There will be a day when a fetus can be removed from a woman at any age and put in an incubator until developed enough to survive outside the incubator. This of course brings up many more ethical questions that are not related to this CMV. But that is the future.\n\nWho will pay for this child once they are fully developed?  Do you think the government will take on the burden of raising the child in this future where every fetus becomes a child via technology?  Or do you think the parents will be responsible for a child they didn't want because technology got to the point they can survive without gestation?",

When a pregnant woman is killed, it's extremely relevant to those seeking justice that they get it for both lives lost.\n\n2. For me personally, it's extremely relevant that fetuses are living. It's the most important reason for why I want abortions to be decreased. Given how safe abortions have become, it's pretty much the only reason why I want them to be decreased (although the fact that they can cause emotional trauma/grief and carry a very low but non-zero risk of physical issues also factor in). I also believe in the science, which clearly demonstrates the best/cheapest/fastest/safest/only way to truly decrease abortions is by early and accurate sex ed combined with easy access to cheap and reliable birth control. Making abortions illegal/difficult to obtain has been shown, time and time again, to not decrease abortions. Usually there's an increase of them because the policies also call for less sex education and less birth control. \n\n3. There are some places where pregnancies are ended based solely on the gender of the fetus. There are people who abort because their fetus a certain race. There are people who would abort if we found ways to determine things like homosexuality in utero. How does that make you feel? If you're bothered by this, it likely means you think of them not just as future humans but current humans. \n\nIf you confine your view to something more specific like, \"A fetus being alive is irrelevant to whether it's legal to have an abortion,\" I would say there's no point in changing your view because the government should not infringe upon the rights of an individual and their health.

You and your sister have a rare blood type that only the two of you share. She gets into a horrible car accident and will die if you do not give her a blood transfusion. under the principles of bodily autonomy, under no circumstances can you be forced to give blood, no matter how rare it is or how dire the situation is. You can choose to let your sister die, and you are not wrong for it, because to force you to save her would violate your bodily autonomy. \n\nTherefore, a baby is much the same thing. You are being forced to give up your bodily autonomy when you get pregnant and you should have the option to opt out of that via abortion, or so the argument goes.\n\nNow, setting aside the fact that pregnancy isn't magic and you very much do have to opt into it via *sex* a solid 99% of the time (note that in the above example you're not opting out of a blood transfusion in progress, you never got one in the first place)... Let's do a quick counter analogy.\n\nImagine the same scenario as above, except your sister doesn't need a blood transfusion. She's just in a coma, but she will almost certainly recover in a few months time. A witch doctor turns you into a living voodoo doll connected to your sister. Anything that happens to you will now also happen to her until she wakes up.\n\nNow, ignoring the legality of it depending on where you live, under the principles of bodily autonomy, your body and therefore your life are your own to do with what you like. Do you have a right to commit suicide, knowing it will also kill your sister? \n\nIf all you do is nothing, she lives.\n\nThis is what pregnancy is like. You're not *doing nothing* to save your autonomy, as you would be in a blood transfusion scenario, you're going out of your way to actively violate someone else's bodily autonomy to preserve your own.\n\nThat's why I think autonomy isn't really a great argument for abortion, at least not in isolation.",

            "text": "Whether a fetus is a *person* is the fundamental question of the abortion debate because it changes the calculus as to whose rights are at stake and how they are balanced. I use the word \"person\" instead of \"alive\" because I think it more accurately represents the question you mean to reference - when individual rights vest in a human being, I.e. when one becomes a *person*. There is little doubt that a fetus is *alive* from a biological standpoint.\n\nThe reason this matters is that if a fetus is not a person with rights, then the *only* individual rights at stake are the woman's bodily autonomy rights. In this situation, legalized abortion seems like the logical choice.\n\nIf a fetus is a person with individual rights, you now have two parties with rights at stake: the woman and the fetus, with its own rights to life and perhaps bodily autonomy. I will analyze this from a legal standpoint because the law is ultimately how we decide these questions in society. **Again, all of the following assumes fetal personhood.**\n\nWhen two parties have conflicting legal rights, the law typically engages in a balancing of interests where a court examines both of their rights, along with the circumstances of the particular situation. The court may attempt to find a solution where both of their rights are accommodated. The scenarios where a court ultimately favors *one* person's rights entirely involve things like property disputes (awarding possession of land to one claimant over another), not life or death.\n\nHere, choosing the woman's rights entirely over the fetus' would literally result in the killing of a person. Given the seriousness of this, I imagine the law would be inclined to find a solution that accommodates the rights of both parties. Additionally, in the case of the ordinary pregnancy from consensual sex a court would likely consider the fact that the fetus had zero say in the conflict's existence, whereas the woman had at least some. This would likely weigh in the fetus's favor.\n\nThus, given the way the law ordinarily treats conflicts of legal rights, the seriousness of resolving the conflict by killing one of the parties, and the inherent unfairness of killing a person who had absolutely no control over their own existence to prioritize the rights of someone who did, fetal personhood makes it *much* more likely that the law would favor restricting abortion.\n\nThe idea that it *doesn't matter* whether a fetus is a person or not is particularly unusual. You are suggesting a totally fundamentalist view of bodily autonomy rights, in which these rights are so all-encompassing that even when pitted against another person's right to be alive, your bodily autonomy rights **alone and without further consideration,** justify the murder of the other person. It's not unlike how the world's most extreme libertarian might believe property rights alone justify shooting a fleeing robber in the back to prevent him from taking your television.\n\nI cannot think of *any* scenarios where two parties have conflicting legal rights and *zero* consideration is given to one party, especially when the outcome for that party is death.",

It's a whole different set of circumstances at that point. A parent is morally obligated to provide for their child in the ways that are possible. For a mother capable of carrying her child to term safely, then this is a reasonable requirement, similar to providing food, clothing, and shelter. Unless you wish to argue that a mother being pregnant with her child is an unusual or extreme circumstance? But really, that's just an entirely different argument. A mother might not be required to give up her kidney for a child, but if we can reasonably expect every parent to drastically change their life style for 18 years to raise a kid, I think we can agree that a mother gives up her uterus for 9 months when her child needs it, as EVERY child needs it more or less.\n\n- the difference between unwanted pregnancy and rape is huge. I mean, come on. When you have sex, you accept that you may become pregnant. When you get in a car, you accept you may get in an accident. THAT'S a better analogy. For one, statistically, rape and unwanted pregnancy are MILES apart. Second, there is cause and effect. You cannot be in a vehicle on vehicle collision if you don't get in a car. You can't get pregnant if you don't have sex. But frankly, you can get raped whether you stay at home, go out, drink, don't drink, whatever. There isn't an action out there that causes rape, that people choose to do anyways. It's not the effect of any given action by the victim. It's a horrible, devastating consequence of another humans choice to violate someone else. Simply put, except in extreme circumstance, you are NEVER the victim of pregnancy. You are always the victim of rape.",

If a women realizes she is pregnant at 6 weeks (just picking a random time) and chooses not to get an abortion, then at 8.9 months there is a baby inside her, but it still depends on her to live until it is born, that woman has accepted responsibility for the baby at this point. But your argument states that an abortion at that point is justifiable soley because the baby is still dependant on the mothers body.\n\n\n2. To further that point, a baby relies on a mother to feed it. Whether it is milk from her body or formula, there are bodily actions a mother must take to ensure a newborn baby's survival. If no one can be held responsible to take actions with their body that they choose not to, why does that end at the 9 month mark?\n\n\n3. If we are allowing for a moral stance around a baby being able to survive without being in the mother, then you are saying that people with less access to health care are not responsible for longer - and how much of a drain in personal finances is acceptable to consider a baby able to live outside of the mother\n\n4. How much does the difference between a baby surviving outside the womb and a baby thriving need to be taken into account. What if a baby can survive but with developmental disabilities - is it ok for a mother to have them removed at that point but not ok for an abortion?\n\n\nGenerally, I think that at some point the woman needs to make a decision to be responsible for the baby or not - I am not sure where that line should be, but the 9 month mark is a somewhat arbitrary point well past when a decision should be made. I think the question if a fetus being alive is an attempt to pin a reason to where that line should be. \n\nAs in, \"while it is a fetus, the prospective mother should decide whether or not she will take responsibility for the resulting baby - if not she gets an abortion, if so she is responsible\"",

Perhaps, but there are a lot of flaws with this, such as ability for it to survive quite well if born a month or two early, defining when the birth counts (when labour starts? When head shows? What about c sections?). So for the pro-life crowd, they say the transition from an alive fetus with no rights to a human with rights occurs at some point within the womb. Many pro-choice folks would agree but would pick a later date within the womb. So now the dilemma is - when is that transition? How do we morally justify a point of transition?\n\nIn answering this dilemma, the degree to which the fetus is \"alive\" actually becomes the only way in which either side can make their case. If pro-choice, then the aliveness is not fully realized until (birth/third trimester/insert arbitrary period here). If pro-life, then the aliveness is fully realized at conception/heartbeat/end of first trimester/arbitrary date/etc. So really, the degree to which it is alive is the only relevant thing for either side on which to base their case.\n\nOnce the aliveness is fully realized, and classification as human occurs, then all arguments for a woman not being required to support it also apply to the newly-classified human to have its own rights protected.

BUT when I was pregnant at around 16weeks I could feel her kicking, idk when the cutoff should be I'm not the person to mandate these things.\n\n 6 weeks is deff too early because most people won't even know they are pregnant. I found out I was pregnant at almost 4 weeks just by chance because I had a pap scheduled at that time. Otherwise I prob wouldn't have noticed for a couple more weeks since I just recently started tracking my ovulation and period. At 8 weeks I had my first ultrasound and we cried seeing out little gummy bear, you can see their little heart beat and hear it. \n\nI had gotten off of my bc a year prior to getting preggers and we just had one wild night, prior we had no issues preventing unwanted pregnancy for an entire year. I can literally tell you the day we got pregnant. \n\nLate term abortion is fucking unspeakable to me, it's literally the same as murdering a baby in my eyes.  3rd trimester abortions should be fucking illegal and are in most states, but there are people that champion that right and it disgusts me.\n\n There are soooo many ways to prevent unwanted pregnancy. Condoms, diaphragms, hormonal and non hormonal bc including iuds pills shots implants. I know some of these things fail sometimes, although most are over 99% effective. Abortions should be a last resort and I'm not judging anyone who has had to use that last resort.\n\n But there is one women I know who has had 4 abortions and brags about it, her family is rich she has good health insurance, there is absolutely no reason why she should need to constantly get abortions. When I was broke AF I paid 30bucks I didn't even have to get my bc pills every month because I didn't have insurance. She just forgos any kind of prevention except abortion, she has two kids and says she can't stand the thought of having another . Yet refuses to use any kind of contraceptive? \n\nOne of my best friends was dating her for a few years, two of her abortions were from him and he didn't even know until after. He literally drove her to what he thought was a doctor's appt for her to come out and tell him she got an abortion, and it broke his heart. She couldn't even tell him before hand. It's not like he would have made her keep it but he would have liked to at least give his opinion and she never gave him that chance.\n\n I realise it's her body her choice so I understand her not telling him, but it seemed to really hurt him and he is a good man he would never have tried to force her to keep a baby.\n\nSome people need to take fucking responsibility for their reproductive organs, that is reproductive rights in my book. Downvote me to shit it's my opinion.\n\nEdit: I would also like to add my opinion on viability outside the womb. What constitutes as viable, is a fetus is born at 21 weeks in Alabama to relatively poor parents at a terrible hospital and doesn't make it it's not viable? But say the same fetus at 21 weeks is born and it's at one of the best hospitals to fairly wealthy parents with great health insurance and the best doctors, and it survives. Is that fetus viable or not, just because the one at the best hospital with better financial situation survives is it more viable than the other that just didn't have the money to have those options. Just some food for thought idk\n\nhttps://www.childrensmn.org/2020/12/23/baby-richard-born-21-weeks-one-youngest-babies-survive/",

It's sufficient to deal with the first assumption alone, and this is all from pro-choice perspective:\n\n>. A woman has no obligation to provide blood, tissue, organs, or life support to another human being... \n\nA sweeping general statement that is false. Any human being is obligated to provide for other human beings if they are in their care and charge. If a father abandons his young children without food or water and goes take a trip somewhere, won't he be arrested and they would be charged with negligence? If a prison holds adult inmates, wouldn't they be required to provide them food, water, etc. even if being in prison is kind of the prisoners fault? Can they just leave them to die? Can a disabled old grandparent be pushed off onto the street corner and left to die of starvation and exposure to the elements? \n\nThere's an obligation towards other human beings, and that obligation is not only moral but also legal if one person is charged with the care of the other. That also transcends whether the first person made an active choice or not in being the primary caregiver, they are REQUIRED to provide the necessary life support until they can safely handover responsibility, whether putting up a newborn for adoption or calling in a nurse to take care of a senile elderly. \n\nWhether they were planned or an accident, a 1 hour old baby or 14 year old teenager, a parent is responsible for their children and their welfare. Sperm cells and human ovum however are not living human beings and no one claims we are obligated to take care of our sperm and ovums.

and in turn, us humans who have brains, hearts, and souls, concerned with the actual impact of our society on the earth, who teach our own kids, give to them our own bodies, and do our part to suppress… global… extinction… events… we should be obliged to ensure her lack of obligation..?\ndouble edged sword, see? where does the obligation fall? to ensure these women dont suffer those other obligations?\n\nmaybe if you tell me who ideally shoulders the responsibility of fostering and bringing up life in your mind, i could better attack your opinion. the government, right? gives the parentless babies pills that teach them ethics, morality, human responsibility? maybe it’s ethically responsible, in your paradise, to make as many babies as humanly possible, because there are infinite resources, the government-tribe-based upbringing is widely exhorted, and we arent running out of room on the planet.\n\na beautiful dream. oh to dream. \nalas. yes. obligations today so that heaven tomorrow. in your heaven society, i guess, the tribe raised children dont have lopsided understandings of personal worth, they are all given a deeply rich, state-centric, education, and they all grow up to be level headed, worldly people, who have sex, yes, but take care of their offspring more tertiarily. by sending them off to the government and paying taxes to ensure their state-designed upbringing. \n it would definitely change the dynamic. love of family replaced by love of state. the feelings once reserved for someone special, which you learned being someone special to someone, become feelings the state taught you. the new concept of love becomes “the state will provide for us, do you want to have consequence-less coitus as we give thanks and unborn kids to our wonderful upbringers?” \nand likewise every emotion would be state-taught. happy, sad, good, bad. it would all be standardized and taught as a part of class for the legions of unwanted infants. aye, yes, class for all the babies the state adopts. as young as they can be made to sit upright. the state would provide wonderful teachers to every single baby, who do a blessed job raising them, not a mistake made. and every baby’s heart and tummy remain full straight into adulthood. sure, why not. \n\nbut. you argue using the present tense. that today, our women should not suffer these obligations…\nthe way i feel is that we were all born in the place we were supposed to make heaven, but we ourselves fail, each of us, to make it so. \nits our obligation to use what we know, the idea of heaven, while we are still alive, to give *ourselves* the heaven we expect is waiting when we die. does this mean youre obligated to suffer painful pregnancy and costly childrearing? you? not at all. you dont have to get pregnant at all, to bring about heaven. you are under no specific obligation, therefore, to sacrifice your organs. but, you know, what i’m saying is, modern woman is still obligated to sacrifice her body if anyone wants a baby.. lol. hers or a surrogate’s, still talking about women’s obligation though. \nand we are faaar from the alternative. the example youre painting, where the woman’s body is no longer the battlegrounds for reproduction, is a pipe dream from a more perfect society. \nin a perfect society, we wouldnt theoretically need vaccines or invasive birth control. we wouldnt theoretically have a patriarchy-preferring clown carnival where the cutthroatest alpha wins the world. we wouldnt have a waste-centric contraceptive system, where the pills that stop babies cost X but the pills to make those pills not make you suicidal cost XYZ. where the alternative is buying a fucking piece of disposable clothing every time you have sex. we wouldnt be struggling for our very lives against bezos and his ilk. but we do, and therefore we are. those who make it worse wont make it better. so its up to everyone else to pick up the slack for the rich’s neglected responsibility. \nso, the woman ideally does not have those obligations, in alien paradise, but the modern human, who hopes for the world you hope for, currently does. or else the ideal world you want won’t ever exist. else no ideal world will ever exist. if you still argue she has no obligation, maybe because she doesnt see reason for her sacrifice, i posit this: the universe does not generate unique souls for every person. our souls are connected, indeed we are eachother’s reincarnated spirits, i suggest. i think our lives’ experiences tally up to make our soul better, lovelier, as we stitch and weave our way through every single person there is. if you are inclined to agree this might be possible, you are charged with the responsibility to make other lives better based on the very understandable premise- that it’s easy to see you prefer it when your own life is better. and someday you may be them. \nso——sacrifice some of yourself now to make your experience better then? if it costs very little now, and feels very good, then, then thats measurable profit. profit good? obligation leads to reward, yes?\n\n2. i have no reason to disagree except on the basis that humanity in the present is really fucked up and currently asphyxiating so therefore cant afford to spare its dwindling resources on something as noble as removing pain from the woman’s experience.  uh. one note: you seem to argue that it would be fine to do that to a baby in today’s world. does your question portray the baby being government property once it’s put in the incubation chamber, or is mom coming back for the baby? if shes coming back, i… dont see anything wrong with situationally extracting an unborn into an incubator… unless the woman is just like “fat belly? f that, you can grow on your own”. \nlove grows off confidence. confidence grows off patterned behavior. if the story in the family goes that mom wanted to look skinny and keep taking drugs, it doesnt establish a very strong pattern. if you cant do nine months of discomfort, you dont look like you can take 18 years of parenting. again: in the modern day. \n\nso, today, pulling your baby out for aesthetic or comfort reasons would be like announcing that you dont care about limited resources, you dont think its wrong using the resources you unjustly have to have an easier life than someone else who lacks them, and you don’t value the bonding time between yourself and the miracle youre a part of. baby A grew in a womb and was talked to and had music played for him. \nbaby B existed in a tube, a sensory vacuum, emotionally cold, devoid of mother’s touch and sound, and then suddenly, the world! \n\n\npost split in half due to length. see reply by me below",

            "text": "Some thoughts:\n\n1. It seems to me that even active life-saving measures are morally imperative in some circumstances. Suppose you have the opportunity to save a child's life for cost=X. Where X=\"no cost\" or X=\"a matter of inconvenience,\" it seems to be morally reprehensible not to take action (supposing we control the scenario such that you have reasonable time to deliberate and be relatively certain of the outcomes, etc.). For example, suppose that you see a child about to get hit by a car. Suppose you have ample time to save the child's life and at the cost of the inconvenience of 30 seconds of your time, you chose not to save the child's life and the child is hit by the car and dies. I suggest that most people would find that morally reprehensible. On that basis, I think I take issue with your point as stated. We could imagine circumstances where, say, providing blood was a matter of inconvenience (as with, say, pricking one's finger as with blood sugar tests) where providing some kind of active life-saving measures would be morally imperative. Whether nausea, physical discomfort, distortion of body shape, social consequences, and several days in C-section recovery constitute a sufficient X-value to justify inaction is a matter of debate. That being said, the difference between these examples and the case of abortion is that we're not concerned with sufficient conditions to justify *inaction*, but sufficient conditions to justify *action*, i.e. killing someone. It seems to me that most people think nausea, physical discomfort, distortion of body shape, social consequences, and several days in recovery are not sufficient causes to kill someone. As such, killing someone for these reasons is generally seen as morally reprehensible. The reprehensibility would be compounded if irresponsibility on the mother's part led to that circumstance.\n2. I'm not sure I follow the logic of this point with reference to your argument, i.e. the fetus being alive is irrelevant.\n3. You seem to be saying, \"Suppose that consensual sex has an unforeseen outcome that was reasonably accounted for, i.e. we used contraception and still got pregnant, and that the pregnancy itself was not consented to. Isn't this equivalent to saying that appearing in public has an unforeseen outcome that was reasonably accounted for, and the sex itself was not consented to?\" This is an interesting comparison. But, it seems that pregnancy is a reasonable consequence of sex (and one most people see as an implicitly accepted risk in the sexual act), whereas rape is an unreasonable consequence of appearing in public. EDIT: \"No woman gleefully goes through an abortion\" doesn't seem to be true. \n4. I'm not sure I follow the logic of this point with reference to your argument either.",

Most genuinely believe they have science on their side and its simply evil feminism and leftist selfishness that keeps the law from recognising what they see as murder for what it is.\n\nLet me explain. \n\nFor most pro life people, it is self evident that when a sperm and egg meet, fuse and form unique new human DNA, aka conception (perhaps with a few days fuzziness either side depending on your view of the exact biological processes), that a new living human now exists to which the same quality of values exist as to any other living human. \n\nThe deeper thinking ones can then apply the same human rights analysis that pro choice advocates favour to this scenario, identify the conflict of the right of the mother to bodily autonomy and the right of the \"child\" to life and conclude the latter is higher in the hierarchy of rights and thus 'trumps' the mother's choices.\n\nNow this all has its own consistent internal logic until you dig a bit deeper and ask why we ascribe humans rights, or more specifically, what quality of a human is it that entitles them to rights. Saying \"they are human therefore they have rights\" simplistically is just a semantic argument about the meaning of human and not very interesting unless you dig to this deeper question. \n\nSo the question of what makes an entity entitled to human rights is a much more interesting one with many possible takes. Pro lifers are, at least implicitly, taking the view that novel human dna with the potential to form an independent person should immediately have these rights, but for me arguments based on future potential are fraught with difficulty, not least because they potential can only be fulfilled in very precise circumstances with a lot of passive and some active assistance from the mother. Logically those taking this view should (but don't always or even usually) take the view that IVF or storage of fertilised embryos is also murder, and (even less commonly but no less logically) that a woman who miscarries after doing activities that increase chances of miscarriage might be guilty of a crime (though less than murder).\n\nThe existing law in most sensible countries has taken an easy to understand view, which I think is ultimately poorly conceived albeit worlds better than the pro life view, of saying it is viability that should determine the point at which the foetus becomes an independent human and has rights, absent a threat to the superior right to life of the mother. This is problematic because he point of viability is a moving target, determined by medical technology and science. There's no reason to think that it won't in the near future be possible to go from independent egg and sperm all the way to breathing infant in a lab absent mother. This makes it an odd philosophical choice to hang rights on; its a purely practical division.\n\nA better but harder to explain distinction, in my view, is that the thing that makes Humans worthy of rights is our executive higher brain function. Just as a body which loses all higher brain function is pronounced irrecoverably brain dead, a foetus before about 22 weeks has no regular higher brain patterns at all and should not be considered yet \"brain alive\". This distinction is closely tied to the idea of rights attaching to personhood rather than humanity, with the former different from the latter semantically in the sense that one must have personality or animus to assert rights.\n\nHigher brain function can also be measured by EEGs, and thus this distinction is both philosophically and practically satisfying.\n\nI went a bit off topic but i hope I've at least informed if not changed your views",

Pro-lifers aren't going out and asking women to do anything else with their body. It's not even in the ballpark of our concerns. \n\nBut once we get past the physical process of artificial birthing, we now encounter problems. Unless we developed a very ethically complex system of pooling foetuses for adoption, caretaking responsibility would remain with the parents. The state is never going to commit to this level of expenditure, risk and moral question - especially not in a democracy where the entire government can shift every four years. \n\nSo while incubation separates the mother from the physical burdens of pregnancy, she would still end up with full ongoing parental responsibility - which is the main issue that abortion is aiming to solve. \n\n-----\n\n\nRegarding point 3, these are not equivalent\n\nHaving sex is an active choice to undertake a reproductive act knowing the risks and benefits. The entire decision is centred around the act of reproduction,  with time to consider contraceptives beforehand, factoring these into an autonomous and active choice to participate in reproductive acts\n\nBeing in public does also carry risks and benefits, but there's no active personal choice of reproductive actions.  If anything, I don't think it's a huge leap to assume that most women are actively aiming to avoid unwanted reproductive acts when they head out for a walk. In rape, the woman has all autonomy removed, and penetration/internal ejaculation (i.e. the actual reproductive act) is not an active risk-benefit choice\n\n\n-----\n\n\nRe: point 4\n\nI do agree with you that technology is going to solve things somewhere along the line....\n\n...*until* I consider what technology we currently have \n\nCondoms are available in every supermarket, petrol station, Amazon delivery and nightclub restroom. In the UK, Amazon will drop you 50 rubbers for under a tenner, so I don't buy the argument of affordability. Although if that's really an issue, condoms are free at every sexual health clinic.\n\nAlongside this, we have about 10 methods of women having complete reproductive choice through contraception, all of which (except the morning-after-pill) are in the bracket of 97%-99.9% effectiveness. And that's not 99% of sexual encounters - it's 99% of the subset of encounters would have ended in pregnancy. Even if you can't swallow tablets and your GP days that hormonal contraceptives are contraindicated, there are non-hormonal IUDs that are equally effective (in addition to the +95% condom you already have)\n\nNow let's say you don't carry a condom in your wallet, you can't take the pill, you are waiting for your IUD implant appointment, you are in the third week of your cycle and you have a random encounter where you absolutely must have a dude ejaculate inside you... the morning after pill will still eradicate 50-80% of those pregnancies.\n\nWhile you can always improve technology, contraceptives are probably one of the most effective, available and accessible medical technology, even considering personal preferences and varying levels of planning and spontaneity. \n\nAnd we still sit here arguing that *abortion must remain legal, while we wait for technology to improve*?

Ultimately, the question itself (not its answer) is a contra-indicator of relevance.\n\nIt *is* relevant, in the sense that it is connected to the larger topic of the ethics of abortion. That is to say, assigning a fetus to a category - like \"living human\" or \"non-human tissue\" - or even deciding it is in a category of its own - seems like the kind of thing that ought to factor into _some_ kind of ethical answer in the larger discussion.\n\nHowever, because the question is almost entirely inconsequential, it is almost entirely used, deployed, and debated by those intending to disjoin the conversation away from a philosophical discussion of abortion ethics. Even if we could definitively answer \"is fetus alive?\", we would not move any closer to answering the larger question. If anything, we would be further from answering it.\n\nOne problem here is that there are many, *very* different ethical frameworks we might be operating under, many of which would be implicated in different ways by the answer, and nothing in the \"is fetus a living human?\" question situates our discussion under any particular ethical framework. Worse, it's terribly unlikely that the answer tells us anything useful under the ethical framework anyone _is_ using.\n\nAbsolute moral stances like \"never take another life\" are rare, most of us do not operate under such strictures. Most humans who intend to behave ethically will attempt to strike a balance between their own needs and their responsibilities to others. In almost all ethical frameworks, those others are not required to be strictly other living humans. \n\nIn almost every ethical framework, it is unethical to treat harm falling on others as insignificant, whether the \"others\" are currently living humans, currently living animals, or *potential future* life. In most ethical frameworks, it is even possible to contemplate the ethics of [currently but not guaranteed to forever be entirely fictional] situations, in Westworld or Star Trek, say, that might involve aliens or entirely artificial forms of life.\n\nWhile there are absolutist frameworks like fruitarianism, most ethical humans would ask if the loss or harm of life is justifiable under circumstances. _Is executing a criminal legal?_ Depends. _Is harming another in self-defense justified?_ Possibly, it depends. _Is murdering soldiers in war justified?_ Possibly, but a lot depends on the circumstances. It almost never depends - at all - on whether or not the subject is technically a living human.\n\nAgain, there really are some people who believe it is unethical to end *any* kind of life for their own benefit, whether animal or vegetable. Many, maybe most people would not go quite that far, but would still draw a line at something like \"unecessary suffering or cruelty\". There are multiple legitimate ethical frameworks that will allow you to enjoy BBQ and still hate cock fights. \n\nWhether or not a fetus is a living human, a pregnant human is *definitely* a living human. The mechanisms of pregnancy mean there's no easy way to disentangle the definitely living human from the other entity (it's a vaguely interesting abstract discussion, but one with almost zero practical sense - somewhat literally: obstetrics accesses the outermost human almost exclusively and *hopes* for good outcomes for the fetus) and there's no way to separate the question \"how should we treat a fetus?\" from \"how should we treat the pregnant person?\"\n\nAll of this means the smallest atomic unit of the abortion question is not really \"is this entity alive?\" but \"who's decision is this?\" \n\nOr maybe phrased slightly different as: who do we entrust to decide whether or not this potential harming of life is justifiable under the circumstances?\n\nIf those are the key ethical questions, then in almost all non-fruitarian ethical frameworks, \"is this alive?\" is, at best, an irrelevant distraction. And if we've had this debate, in public, over and over, for many decades, those who are still asking the question are almost certainly asking in bad faith.\n\nThe lengthy history of this debate is an almost entirely inescapable conclusion that, in most if not all circumstances, the decision ultimately must come down to the pregnant person themselves (and possibly their medical specialist). The circumstances -- of consent, of viability, of maternal risk factors and support -- let alone the consequences are too much (too specific, too detailed, and too private) for almost anyone else to judge. \n\ntldr: the theoretical intent of debating \"is a fetus a living human?\" is that the answer to that question ought to have bearing on the discussion of abortion ethics, but - because this question is not situated in a framework for ethical decision making, and even if it were, in practice, almost always a distraction from the key ethical considerations - asking the question at all is actually a sign of someone engaging the discussion in bad faith.",

            "text": "I think the main point of Pro-Life isn’t just that a fetus is alive, but that a fetus is a human being. Even if a fetus can’t think, or see, or hear, or experience pain, it’s still a human being whose life has the same value as me and you. When you’re a child, you have less rights and freedoms, and as you get older the challenges, expectations, and rights you have change over time. However, you are never ever less human. Your life is never worth less than another person’s. Throughout history, there have been times when we as a society have dehumanized others and viewed them as not even alive or animals. However, we have never been truly proud of these ideas because they’ve spawned such evil and pain and because they run against the basic human emotions of love and empathy. That’s why, it doesn’t matter if you’re 2 or 20. A person isn’t inherently allowed to kill you at any age because of your age. Culturally, you’re still regarded as a person.\n\nYou talk about the fetus like it’s a thing, but pro-lifers view them as people, just like us. Children are people. Babies are people. You don’t have to be fully grown to be a person.\n\nA pro-choice person would then argue that the fetus isn’t alive and thus doesn’t count as a person. But even typing this, I realize that idea seems harshly cruel and this disconnect is why the issue today is hard to discuss. Pro-Lifers and Pro-Choicers are talking about life when what they really care about is does a fetus count as a human being. Are they are a thing or a person?\n\n\nEDIT: I wanted to add a last section detailing the logical steps that lead to why “being alive” is important.\n\nThe core argument to decide if Abortion is morally okay is “is a fetus a person, a human being?”.\n\nWhat does it take to qualify as a person? Do you need to be able to see, to feel pain? Do you need to be able to talk? Blind and deaf people are still people, so it’s not about sensory. Mute people are people. Children are people. Even a person in a coma is still a person. They can’t speak or talk or hear or experience, but you still think of them as a person, not a thing you can dissect or throw out or steal.\n\nIt becomes clear then that the only things you need then to be a human being, is to be alive and genetically a person/sentient being.\n\nSince fetus’s are obviously genetically people and will become people, the argument becomes are they alive?\n\nEven then, it’s a little sus because non-alive people (dead and fetus’s) are still seen as “kind of” human in our society. A dead’s person body becomes a thing but you still think of their soul, who they are, as a person",
