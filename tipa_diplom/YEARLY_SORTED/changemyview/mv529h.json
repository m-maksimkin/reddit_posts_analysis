    "CMV: In most situations, you should just assume people's pronouns. If you assume wrong, and they get offended, then they're overly sensitive.\nSome people make a big deal over not assuming anyone's gender. According to certain people, you're supposed to ask everyone for their pronouns shortly after meeting them. This is dumb. \n\n**Argument 1**\n\nI think the motivation for this way of thinking is misplaced. People get upset at the idea of someone purposefully using the wrong pronouns as an insult, and they want to emphasize that this is offensive. For this reason, someone came up with the idea that you should ask everyone for their pronouns. \n\nBut, there's a difference between using the wrong pronouns as an insult, and incorrectly guessing someone's pronouns. In the first instance, the person is trying to offend you. In the second instance, they're just making an honest mistake. You shouldn't get angry at the person making a mistake. \n\nIf you fly into an emotional fit because someone mistakenly used the wrong pronouns, then you're being unreasonable. That's a silly thing to get upset about. By all means, feel free to get offended if someone is trying to insult you by using different pronouns than you prefer. But, don't freak out on a good-natured person because they made a mistake. That just makes you look emotionally unstable. Simply correct them. It doesn't have to be a big deal. \n\n**Argument 2**\n\nSome people may argue that trans people are emotionally fragile. We need to be extra delicate with our use of pronouns because a trans person might become an emotional wreck if the wrong pronoun is used. \n\nMy first response is that if you think this, then you're really babying trans people. You're also counteracting the narrative that they're just regular people with one unique characteristic. You're acting like they're unhinged. Unless someone is being purposefully insulting, a regular person is not going to freak out if the wrong pronoun is used. If we need to tip toe around pronouns for fear of freaking out trans people, then that makes them seem like lunatics. I don't think that's the message people are trying to spread. \n\nMy second response would be that its possible for people to be sensitive about all sorts of issues. Some people are afraid of dogs. Should I refrain from mentioning my dog for fear that someone might have a dog phobia? Should I delicately ask someone if they have any animal phobias before bringing up the subject of pet ownership? Obviously, that would be unreasonable. So, why are we taking so many pains not to upset people with gender triggers? Why aren't we taking the same pains not to upset people with other triggers? Why is it ok to mention medical issues, considering that some people are squeamish about that subject? Why aren't we asking everyone to give us a list of emotional subjects before proceeding with a conversation? Why is gender the one issue so sensitive that we must not proceed with conversation before polling everyone? \n\n**Exceptions**\n\nAll that said, my title states that we should assume people's gender in *most* situations. Admittedly, there are some situations in which that might be less appropriate. For instance, you might wish to ask someone for their gender if they have an androgynous appearance. Its a reasonable question if someone is presenting in a way which indicates that they might not simply be a straight cis person. Depending on your social circles, the majority of people you meet will not fall in that category. That's why I say you should assume people's gender in \"most\" situations. \n\n**Concluding thoughts**\n\nFinally, I think that most ardent proponents of verifying everyone's gender are typically not trans themselves. I've never seen a trans person freak out over mistaken use of the wrong pronouns. I tend to assume that most people are relatively calm and reasonable, be they cis, trans, straight, or gay. \n\nFrom what I can tell, the unreasonable people are typically keyboard warriors who are getting offended on someone else's behalf. I think these people tarnish trans people by spreading the idea that they're hyper sensitive lunatics who might freak out over grammar mistakes. \n\nWhat's more, if you enter a conversation asking about pronouns, I think most people are going to worry that you are hypersensitive. Its just going to make everyone think they have to tip toe around you.": [

            "text": "I think you miss the point about what it means to people to be correctly gendered, and the goals behind creating a new norm of not assuming prounouns and gender. \n\nYou make the point that the reason why you feel like it’s unnecessary to ask for someone’s pronouns (as opposed to just assume their pronouns, and then be corrected if you’re wrong) is because 1) it’s uncomfortable for you to do it and 2) it’s not as important as it is for trans people to not be “offended” as it is for you to not feel awkward and unnecessary. \n\nBut that’s not the point. I understand not wanting to adjust your norm just to keep from offending a minority group of people. There are people who are offended because I have tattoos and cuss, that doesn’t mean I’m not going to have tattoos and cuss just to keep from offending them.\n\nHowever being gendered and referred to correctly is more than just preventing someone from feeling offended. Imagine everyone you meet or talk to refers to you with incorrect pronouns (for ex, if you use he/him pronouns and then all the sudden everyone started calling you she/her). every time you meet someone at a party, and every time you go to the grocery store, and every time you start a new job. I imagine it would feel pretty bad. Your confidence would plummet. You’d start having imposter syndrome, feeling like you can’t pass as cis so you might as well just not even try to be perceived the way you prefer. Your body dysphoria would get worse, and you’d feel so uncomfortable in your skin. You’d wish you could have a different face and body so people would see you the same way you see yourself. You’d start to hate yourself. Not to mention all these thoughts would make it basically impossible to muster up the confidence to correct people on your pronouns. Let alone the fact that there is an incredibly large amount of intolerant people, you never know if they would become violent, start to harass you, or see you differently if you out yourself simply by asking them to use the right pronouns for you.\n\nThat is how it feels for trans and nonbinary people. It’s more than just getting “offended.” When they ask for people to extend an olive branch, a small courteous action, it’s not so that they don’t get offended, it’s to help them feel more comfortable in their own skin. It’s to communicate that you respect them and the way they prefer to be referred to and perceived.\n\nI would also like to make the point that creating more gender inclusive social norms (including normalizing asking for pronouns as opposed to assuming) is beneficial for everyone. I’m sure a lot of people believe that gender nonconforming and trans identities are a “trend” because so many more people who identify as such have come out. However, that is not true, the reason why gender neutrality has become more “popular” or well-known is because as visibility of these identities increases, people have the tools, terms, and spaces in which to explore their identity and be their truest selves. The gender binary sorts people into harmful categories, stereotypes, and identities before they even have the chance to explore and communicate that themselves. \n\nEven for cis people, it is harmful. for example how men are encouraged to be aggressive and unemotional, and how women are encouraged to become mothers, and how engrained it is in society to divide and compare men and women. \n\nBut striving towards developing a gender inclusive status quo will allow all gender identities to be equal. Similarly to how we should strive towards an antiracist society where the color of your skin doesn’t matter at all, and all people are treated equally. Asking people’s pronouns instead of assuming is the first step in that. By abolishing the idea that there is a gender binary, and taking away gendered connotations of certain things in your appearance (for ex. makeup=feminine, facial hair=masculine, etc) we are creating a more inclusive and respectful society, where you are not restricted by preexisting stereotypes and categories!\n\nAnd finally, I find it very interesting that in most of your comments and in your post, you repeat “I think, I feel” phrases about whether or not YOU think it’s necessary and beneficial to trans people (not you) to ask for people’s pronouns. The LGBTQ+ community has expressed an infinite amount of times that it is extremely beneficial and inclusive when people ask for their correct pronouns, so why do you feel like it is appropriate to tell them they are wrong? I understand that you may feel awkward and inappropriate by asking people for their pronouns. It’s hard to get used to and often be the only person in a group who makes an effort to ask. It’s very difficult to feel comfortable in attempting to change the status quo! \n\nHowever, the whole point of being an ally of a marginalized community is to listen when they express how you can be more inclusive for them, and change your actions to be more inclusive. It’s not up to you to decide what is beneficial, and if you don’t want to change or listen to them when they tell you what you should do to be a good ally, then you can’t claim that you are inclusive or accepting of that marginalized group. Not that you ever did, just saying. Plus, saying that you don’t want to be more inclusive because it makes you feel awkward is kind of weak, imo. If a group of people (not as small as you think) wanted me to change a very small part of my behavior in order to make them feel safer and more included in the world, I’d do it, even though maybe sometimes I’m the only one in any given group making an effort. That’s called empathy and allyship.\n\nAll in all, I think I can sum this up by ye old phrase “To Assume just makes an ASS out of U and ME.” If everyone assumed you were like an axe murderer and treated you as such for something as mundane as, say, the color of your hair, that wouldn’t be fair, they didn’t even give you a chance to prove that you’re a good person! I know this is an extreme example, but in my opinion assumptions are rarely a positive.",

One of these senses is sight, so it is natural for someone to 'label' another based on the info provided to them visually (assuming no words are spoken up until that point). Pronouns are apart of how we label people - especially in latin based languages where gender is conveyed commonly as a apart of a conversation. \n\nIf you do not like or agree with the info you provide visually to others - then it is on YOU to correct that info and state your preferred pronouns if need be.

When people argue for everyone asking their pronouns it's because if you're only asking people who look a certain way, we're basically just back to asking trans people 'are you a man or are you a woman' but in a slightly more politically correct way.",

Though most people would fit the boxes you assume they're in, imagine what it's like for people who don't. There are cisgender, feminine men who get mistaken for women all the time. Same the other way around. But for trans and non binary people, it's much worse. These people have spent their entire lives not being taken seriously as who they are because of their body, because of their appearance. I'm not saying someone's going to blow up and throw a tantrum if you call them \"she\" at the grocery store. But taking the time to get in the habit of using \"they\" as a default could give that person a needed break. And in professional settings, having everyone share their pronouns helps not to single out trans people who may not \"pass\" as their gender. If everyone knows how everyone wants to be referred to, even if it is what you would have guessed most of the time, you save so much pain and discomfort for those who don't fit into those boxes.

We are more confident in correcting for other people than ourselves. Not defending our pronouns to even our best friend (and this isn't just pronouns it's also names) may be because of how un normalized it is in the world to mention pronouns. Asking for pronouns at some point in meeting greatly helps almost the entire lgbt community as it helps us get a little more strength to say \"Its they, thanks\" as really it's so scary.\n\n2: Asking for somebodys pronouns only takes a few seconds, you can throw it in at the end if any sentence and it won't distrust the conversation.\n\n\"Yeah and that one scene where the fell to the ground! Amazing!!'\n\n'I know!!!'\n\n\"Oh hey, by the way, pronouns? Forgot to ask.\"\n\n'Oh its they/them! Thanks! yours?\"\n\n\"No problem and He/him! I wonder how that one part with the blood was filmed, it was gross\"\n\ndoesn't take much time, and at \"worst\" the other person will say something about how people never ask their pronouns and slightly scew the topic. It doesn't take long to ask though  so the harm in it outweighs the very minimal bad, and the bad can help weed out people who may be toxic too! (If I ask somebody's pronouns and they start going \"Hahah pronouns what are those mine are nor slash Mal habahaha hope you srnt a tHeY.\" I might not be friends with somebody like that)\n\n3: It makes somebody's day if you ask. The first time somebody asked my pronouns I was giddy for the rest of the day, thought the person I asked didn't see it, I was telling my other lgbt friends just how happy I felt and that \"Oh my gosh somebody asked me my pronouns today nobody has ever done this iknso djdjdjndn\" and was just super excited. Simple.scentence made my day!\n\nOf course there will always be times you don't need to ask and can just use they, if it be referring to a post you saw once or the cashier, but if you are making a new friend or meeting somebody new who you aheb the chance to see again or to talk about, then slip a few words in to make life nice.",

Not even the people you think you are opposing here.  This is easily proven by taken a quick glance at some random reddit comments: how many do you find that start, \"OP -- may I call you OP? -- and what are your pronouns if I may ask?\"  You won't find that in \"woke\" subreddits.  You won't find it in left subreddits.  People just don't do it.  Calling the person \"OP\" works just fine.\n\nSimilarly, \"woke\" people don't ask their cashier at Walmart for pronouns before checking out.  There are plenty of situations in which nobody asks *because it's not important*.  (If you think they do, either you've run into the phenomenon of mascotization, or you've been bamboozled by satire.)\n\nBut that leaves... times when it is important.  You've already admitted it can be, so now we're just negotiating.\n\nSo back to the reddit example.  Do you notice a pattern how we don't tend to say, \"OP said blah, and then *he* said this other thing?\"  We don't assume OP's gender.  If we refer to gender at all, it tends to be \"they.\"  (As long as nobody is *thinking* about the gender issue, \"they\" seems perfectly appropriate to everyone.)  Even though we aren't even trying to get to know OP -- and we might even be calling OP a jerk -- we manage to exhibit this social skill.\n\nSo why would you make the assumption in real life?  You *don't* know.  Saying to yourself, \"Well, I see a bulge, so...\" is adding presumptions that simply aren't needed.  That doesn't mean you need to *ask*.  It just means you shouldn't assume.  If it comes up, then ask.  If it isn't important, then don't force it to come up.",

If you're talking to a person, you are just going to use \"you\" anyway while talking about them for the most part, which would make the whole pronouns debate practically needless. \n\nAnother sort of specific situation where I would sort of disagree is when you're online, talking to or about a random person for who you really can't assume anything based on their username or picture, or don't have enough context to assume anything, it's simply easier saying they if you really have to refer to them in third person rather than bothering to assume. \n\nIn places where the majority of people are of this or that gender, though, I don't mind people \"assuming\" and just generally calling everyone a he or a she based on the majority.

            "text": "Like you, I don't think it's a good idea to ask people's preferred pronouns beforehand. But I do disagree with you. From a different direction: just don't use pronouns.\n \nI agree with your point in **argument 1**: assuming someone's gender/sex isn't necessarily an insult. So you can see that neither usage wins out in this respect.\n \nHowever, not using a gendered pronoun is also not an insult. If you're habituated to using gender pronouns, it can be harder to set out of that habit. Because of this, it's easier to accidentally insult someone. The same cannot be said for not-assuming a gender/sex and using a neutral term, like: \"they\". It's equally not-insulting at first, but even later on, it's not denying any gender either.\n \nSo you could say: gender-neutral terms win in this instance.\n \n**Argument 2**: While some transpeople might be overly emotionally fragile, making it a good idea to ask gender first, I've also heard that some transpeople find it additionally exhausting to have to respond to that, because they just want to pass. Requesting pronoun preference is going to make it be annoying for them. Same could be said for cispeople who also strongly identify by their gender/sex. Especially very macho men can feel very offended if you doubt their gender/sex.\n \nSo what wins here, is also not very clear. Except that gender-neutral terms don't really have any problem with this. I've heard that some feel that \"they\" can sometimes feel more socially distant then \"he\" or \"she\". Which could be a point deduction. But if you don't know them, this social distance isn't even incorrect. So even on this account: gender-neutral terms win. \n \n**Exceptions**: Especially in the 'unclear cases', it might be extra painful to be asked what your pronouns are. Meanwhile, they could also come forward with it themselves. So in the case of these exceptions of uncertainties, the gender-neutral terms are most obviously the winner.\n \n**My own addition**:\n \nI think we should do away with gendered pronouns, why are they really useful? Even in cases where the sex/gender might be important, you don't really need it. Like:\n \n> Where is your girlfriend I would've expected her to be here now.\n \nvs\n \n>  Where is your girlfriend I would've expected them to be here now.\n \nThe meaning of the sentence doesn't change ~~that much~~ at all and it's clear, even to me (a non-native speaker) what is meant. So it shouldn't really matter.\n \nOther languages even give gender to inanimate stuff (e.g. in Spanish: la televisión; el control remoto). Why is this useful?\n \nIn my native language, we have pronouns for people of lower and higher social status or age, English has lost it. Some languages are even more extreme in this, having several pronouns (or other ways of indicating) for several social status levels (see [this video for example](https://youtu.be/GiAv7ypMqAI?t=1065)). Either way, English lacks all this, and I think, this makes it better. Why would we need such divisions? I don't think we do, I think it's actively making it worse. Not just in terms of practical usage and learning the language, but also in moral terms. I don't think it's good to facilitate people in power or with other privileges in their position, it often comes at the expense of people with less. \n \nI think it's more clear that these social pronoun divisions aren't a good thing if we suggest adding more. Pronouns based on gender and social status or age already exist, so, what if we add a couple of pronouns for ethnicity; fellow citizens vs foreigners; whether someone is employed or unemployed. I don't see this making anything better. I see this obviously making things worse.\n \nHaving gendered pronouns may seem categorically different from these, but it's not really. It just seems more natural because we're used to it and it has a higher degree of correspondence with our observations of people, but it's just a difference of degree (and in terms of ethnicity it might even be less clear if you have two highly segregated groups, like with black and white).\n \nSo let's not assume gender indeed, let's not even use those words. Let's just relax and throw that part of the language way just how we thew \"thou\" and \"thee\" away: it's just as useful, namely, not at all.",

I wish it was that simple.

Its disingenuous to pretend like its not. \n\nTransgender people don't have many places where they can be open and free in who they are. Being called \"sir\" or \"he\" can be like a kick in the gut out of nowhere.

Most people I know, when asked about pronouns (and not even the queer ones) will just give you their answer, ask for yours, and then have a conversation with you either about your identity or whatever else you were going to talk to them about.  Just saying \"Hi, I'm (name) and I use (these) pronouns, what about you?\" is just like asking for their name, but with a little more so that you know how to refer to them, don't people ask other people what their dog's pronouns are?\n\nIt's just a way to be polite especially to trans and gender-non-conforming people so that you don't cause anyone discomfort in a situation.

            "text": "As a nonbinary person myself, when you guess somebody's pronouns wrong, next to nobody would argue that you're being malicious. I agree with you entirely that it's an honest mistake, and that it's very difficult to justify somebody being really angry AT someone in particular for using the wrong pronouns with them.\n\n However, that honest mistake can still hurt, and be invalidating, whether you meant it to be or not. How much it hurts can vary a lot based on how the person's mental state is doing, how their day has been, etc etc, but in most cases, it does hurt. And when a trans person's interactions with the world outside of LGBT+ spaces unfortunately consist of so much constant invalidation and aggression, that normally small infraction can do a lot more to somebody than you think. I know it may sound silly, but it's like weight on a camel's back: if more and more is added, it can get to the point where even a small straw feels very heavy. And trans people are almost constantly having weights added by society at large's hatred, or even on the more \"innocent\" end, questioning whether we have a right to exist.\n\n You shouldn't ask for pronouns because \"a trans person might snap and freak out\", and I think that the language you use when you make that point is somewhat dismissive, and it sort of illustrates that you don't understand the issue, if you've conflated it to \"trans people are sensitive eggshells that you need to carefully walk around lest you break them and make them go crazy and freak out\". It's the far more simple, normal fact that asking for somebody's pronouns is an incredibly small piece of effort and time investment, that you could honestly do so much good with. It's just a small act that demonstrates basic decency, not some grand ritual that you need to notarize and get sent through miles of red tape to complete.\n\n With how little effort it takes to ask somebody their pronouns, and how much good it can do to make trans people that you interact with feel validated (not even mentioning how normalizing things like this can actively make trans people safer, as they're a big target of hate crimes, and anything that serves to normalize trans existence will actively make spaces safer) why would you NOT ask someone for their pronouns?\n\n\n\n The second point I'd like to make is that you most definitely aren't nearly as good at guessing pronouns as you think you are. Physical sex is rather easy in most cases to guess, as we've evolved to do so rather consistently, and \"passing\" as another sex is very very difficult to do, but pronouns are an abstract form of identification that exist only between the people that one chooses to share them with. Even when it's spelled out almost certainly for you, it can still be next to impossible to actually figure out somebody's pronouns until they tell you.\n\nFor example, when I said that I'm nonbinary, you probably assumed that I use they/them, correct? Well then, you'd be wrong, as I exclusively use he/him when interacting with others.\n\n\nWhat physical sex somebody is, what gender they identify as, and what pronouns they use to refer to themselves are all wildly separate and different things. And while it may be somewhat easy to guess physical sex in a lot of instances, somebody's gender identity and pronouns won't always line up with that physical sex. I have friends who identify as women yet use he/him, I have friends who use they/them despite being cis, I have friends who use neopronouns, and they're all valid.\n\nThe more and more gender non conformity and transgenderism are normalized and accepted at a higher level in society, more and more will we see people whose pronouns and gender identity don't line up exactly with the physical sex that you may see them as. And the more evident it will be that the current viewpoint you hold is aging, indicative of a dying time.\n\nThe times are changing, and it's important to change with them lest you be left behind.\n\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like to talk with me about this further, I'd be glad to explain more in detail if you'd like.",

I.e. that there is substantial utility to having gendered pronouns (provided that they are used correctly).\n\n\nIf a high standard of care is ordinarily appropriate, then it would suggest that the relative degree of risk & harm from incorrect use is also high. Conversely, if only a low standard of care is needed, then a cursory approach to assessing gender pronouns would be suitable - \"assume\" as much as you like in ordinary circumstances.\n\n\nI've used scare quotes there because I don't think \"assume\" is a sufficiently accurate term for our present purposes. We are either (a) presumptively associating their appearance with a particular gender or (b) straight out guessing. It's not feasible to sensibly do (a) unless the person's appearance is distinctively more in line with expectations for how people of that gender often appear.\n\n\nThe more distinctly gendered those appearances are, the less likely there is to be incorrect pronoun usage based on such presumptions. The required standard of care when the risk is lower need not be (and usually shouldn't be) as high as when the risk is higher.\n\n\nA standard of \"never presume someone's gender\" requires avoiding use of gendered pronouns for >99.5% of people until you have received details of their gender (among other things). Obviously after that point those pronouns can still be useful, but this is still a significant reduction in the utility of gendered pronouns. \"Announce your pronouns\" seems to me to be (in part) a recognition of that reduction in utility. Announce so that other people don't need to presume or ask.\n\n\nSo we're talking about a significant reduction of something which (in these premises) is of substantial utility, from which it follows that the level of risk would have to be significant enough to justify that.\n\n\nThe prevalence of transgenderism is less than half that of people who are wholly or mostly homosexual and it seems to be around about the same or a bit less than the prevalence of asexuality. Western society doesn't presume as much about sexual orientation as it used to, but we do heavily presume that people are not asexual. The expected standard of care when it comes to avoiding getting people's sexual orientation and attraction wrong remains fairly low.\n\n\nOn the other hand, the disparity between people's images of themselves and society's expectations for them for those categories (while often severe) are arguably less frequently at the forefront of their interactions with people from day to day and hour to hour than it is for transgendered people. The potential harm after a transgender person is \"out\" is different to that of a L/G/B person who is out.\n\n\nWhat would be the efficacy of trying to implement this new standard? Can it happen? I don't think so. Accuracy when it comes to orientation and attraction matters most when dealing with people we are acquainted with.  Gender comes up more frequently and here we're talking about people who are practically strangers, which is a wider and much more fluctuating set of people. Brevity and convenience do not favor it. It's counterintuitive to those used to English. Which makes it difficult for it to be passively adopted as custom through increased use. The active social pressure to adhere to it will be relatively low.  Large parts of society will reject it entirely. There won't be as much pressure from the media because most fictional shows that explore social awareness do so in the context of either close relationships or criminality. You can have many stories about people misgendering established characters but it's difficult to have many stories about people assuming the gender of random people the audience knows nothing about.\n\n\nBut let's assume it's realistic or still useful for harm reduction at less-than-customary levels of adoption.  Then we're back with the issue of whether expecting this standard of care from people in ordinary circumstances would be justified by the level of risk of harm without adoption of it. That depends on one's assessment of how much likelihood of harm there is, of the severity of the potential harm, and how inconvenient the standard would be. Most of which is subjective.\n\n\nIf you accept that there is a subjective component, then you should appreciate that people's answers to the question of how cautious/polite we should be about pronouns will differ based upon their own experiences and mindset. In any event, it's less about what any particular misgendered individual feels, as it is about how making efforts to avoid foreseeable and unnecessary harm. \n\n\nNot all subjective positions are equally arguable though. I would say that in circumstances where the main and conveniently controllable features of one's appearance are clearly distinctively masculine or feminine, then if you presume that gender the risk of misgendering is negligible and/or more the result of them not adjusting those features (hair, clothes, etc.).\n\n\n**Question 3**\n\n\nI don't think your two descriptions of the arguments capture the underlying reasoning for support of the idea. Pretty much everything else I agree with.\n\n\nYou're using the language of \"fragility\", \"sensitivity\" etc. and while you're correct to say that trans people shouldn't be characterized that way, both arguments are still only about trans people having some major reaction to being misgendered. Your interaction with them, not their interactions with you and everyone else. Little bits of negative messaging and thinking often adds up. Harm can be suffered without causing such any major or immediate reaction. If nothing else, it's not good to be misgendered.\n\n\nI phrased question 2 by reference to the \"minimum standard of care\" but whatever that \"minimum\" might be, that's only the boundary between \"below minimum\" and \"above minimum\". It's not \"bad\" on one side and \"ideal\" on the other.\n\n\nThe potential harm of asking a woman wearing a wedding ring about \"what her husband is up to today\" because she might have a wife instead is negligible. But if someone finds it easy enough to instead ask about \"her spouse\" then doing so is not about how offended or sensitive this or some other lesbian or bisexual woman might be. It's about trying to do more good, even though it's not normally necessarily expected of you.\n\n\nSome of the vocal proponents of this are simply going be jerks. That happens for everything. Making logical inferences from the arguments of irrational people is rarely as useful as working out what lead them there and making what you from that broader context.\n\n\nLike you, I imagine that the more reasonable proponents aren't making a big deal over it. I expect that want to imply about trans people is nothing more than that \"this would help them\". Less of a mandate and more simply \"be excellent to each other.\"",

            "text": "A bit late on the topic, but wanted to give an insight as a trans girl.\n\nFirst, virtually no trans person will get \"offended\" at a stranger using the wrong pronoun for you. Personally, I think the widely acceptance of using he/him as the neutral pronoun I online spaces is often disheartening. I don't go correcting everyone that does that to me online because I would have to be correcting myself too much every single time, also potentially exposing myself to sexist remarks depending on the setting. When it's irl, it does hurt because of dysphoria, but if this happens when I'm in a small group or if it's a one on one conversation I'll correct them. However, if it's in a large group or if I feel like I'm not in a safe setting, I usually don't have the courage to correct them, even if my fears of them being a bad person are wrong.\n\nSecond, English is lucky enough to have a non-gendered neutral pronoun. So in most situations, you should just use the non-gendered neutral pronouns. It's that simple. People who make a fuss about \"the trans lobby is trying to control how we speak!!\" are the ones making a big deal about it. No one is trying to control how people speak, nor get you a fine for misgendering anyone by mistake. This is just a societal norm we think would benefit everyone if it was more common-place. We might, however, consider someone an asshole if they insist on assuming the gender of everybody they meet instead of switching to the convinient non-gendered pronoun their language has.\n\nThird, asking for pronouns isn't formal at all, and I don't even think that it's singling out trans people (unless you're asking the pronouns only to the gender non-conforming person in a group). For example, I had a girl I my class approach me after class and ask for my pronouns since I dress kind of ambiguously. That made me happy, and it wasn't awkward. Her asking that to me also allowed us to form a friendship faster than with the other people in my class. So really, it's a show of respect rather than just formality and it allows for a personal connection to be born. \n\nHopefully this was helpful. I also wanted to state that most trans people don't get \"offended\" by misgendering the way that some media paints us: getting angry, pulling our hair screaming or any other \"average SJW\" stereotype. What might happen, is that they get hurt and upset, suppress it internally with a sigh and look for the fastest way to get out of this social situation. Trans people are often exposed to violent media that makes you believe correcting someone will more often lead to a worse outcome than just slowly making yourself more miserable about the fact that you need to 'pass' in order for people to see you for you.",

You can't always tell by just looking at someone so if you're worried about offending just uses neutral pronouns or refer to them by their name. For example, I wear dresses and have long hair. But those things don't make me a woman, just as someone who is assigned male at birth is allowed to wear a dress without being assumed trans. The way that people present themselves doesn't need to align with what is generally considered to be the norm for their gender. So assuming is not really a good, nor respectful, way to go about it. If you don't feel comfortable asking, don't. Stick with they/them and if someone gets upset they're probably transphobic or not someone you'd want to spend time with anyway. \n\nSecond, asking for pronouns is really just the same as asking for a name and is often done in the same introductory conversation. If you're on a name knowing base, you're also on a pronouns knowing base. For me, this is almost exclusively people I either went to school with (small college) or work with and see often. I'm not going around flaunting my gender identity and pushing my pronouns on people who I'll never see again. If the server at the restaurant refers to me with the wrong pronouns, I just smile, ignore the weight in my chest, and move on. I'm never going to see them again.\n\nLastly, it's kind of terrifying to announce my pronouns to people I just met. I just worked at a place for almost a year and only one person asked, so only one person knew. How do I know that the people I work with isn't going to harass me because of my gender? Are they going to make fun of me? Are they going to threaten me? Physically harm me? Kill me? These are very real fears a lot of trans people have, especially in new settings. You just don't know and if you have the privilege to hide it, you will until you're made to feel safe. A really good way for cis people to help trans people feel safe is to acknowledge pronouns. Either state your own or ask for theirs. For me, it let's me know that you're accepting of my pronouns and not going to harm me for them. Of course, read the room. I've been places where I know it's safe to be out about my gender, but in a lot of the USA it's not. Try thinking of it as less of an inconvenience for yourself and more of a way to help other people feel safe and accepted and not worried for their safety.",

I'd argue in most situations you don't, in fact - because if you are talking to someone for the first time, you're typically talking to them, not about them. Second person language in English is already non-gendered!\n\nFrom there, you usually have context clues to listen for - other people who are close to them using their pronouns, them talking about themselves using their pronouns, or even a 20 second lull where you can pull out your phone and see if they have them listed on a social profile. Or a minute lull to ask one of your mutual friends. This will get you there in most situations.\n\nUntil you know their pronouns, if you're not comfortable asking because it isn't a social norm yet, you can just use they/them.

So imagine you're a trans person. For whatever reason, your presentation is such that people often confuse your gender. It's an honest mistake every time, but it's with every. Single. Person.\n\nKeeping in mind that gender dysphoria is a thing, one may begin to see how after years of this sort of thing, the person may develop a more emotional reaction.\n\nOf course, trans people are a very small portion of the population. So what should we adopt as a general rule? Should we continue guessing pronouns, knowing that there are people out there, even if only a few, who may take it roughly? Should we ask every new person we meet for pronouns, despite the fact that most people present either very clearly as male, or very clearly as female? Should people tell *me* their preferred pronouns, if they feel necessary?\n\nOne example of a solution (online, that is) is putting your pronouns in your username. It's clear, visible, and explicit. Problem neatly sidestepped.\n\nIn real life, I suppose one could write one's pronouns on their nametag, if they're wearing one. Of course, most people don't go around wearing nametags.\n\nMaybe we should just use they/them for everyone? That would be a little excessive though. And unintuitive, language-wise.\n\nPersonally? I guess pronouns. But if I upset someone as a result, I don't necessarily blame them. Because if I guessed theirs wrongly, I couldn't have been the only one, and if people called me a girl all the time (I'm a guy), eventually I'd get upset too.

            "text": "I want to start by saying that asking for pronouns doesn't hurt anyone. It only stands to benefit society by normalizing not being cis, and helping trans and nonbinary people feel safe and accepted. \n\nIf you're argument is that it shouldn't be mandatory to have to ask for pronouns than I agree, but literally no one thinks that. No one will get mad at you if you don't ask for pronouns as long as you are polite and use someones preferred pronouns when they correct you. You even admit this \n\n>I've never seen a trans person freak out over mistaken use of the wrong pronouns\n\nThis quote of yours is contradictory to earlier statements and shows that you seem to be arguing against imaginary people here.\n\nTo address your first argument, you're not actually arguing against the idea of asking for pronouns. You're arguing against the idea that trans people should be mad at you if you accidentally misgender them. However you know that this doesn't happen. \"I've never seen a trans person freak out over mistaken use of the wrong pronouns\". In most cases a trans person will not be mad *at you* if you accidentally misgender them as long as you are polite and apologize when they correct you. They will just be upset at the fact that it happened because it can feel invalidating and trigger gender dysphoria. I know it's hard to understand for cis people but being misgendered can genuinely be very upsetting for trans people. Asking for pronouns is good because I want the people around me to feel safe, happy, and welcome.\n\nIn the first part of argument 2 you are trivializing how upsetting it can be and calling trans people sensitive for being upset about being misgendered. In the second part of argument 2 you make the analogy with phobias and PTSD. I know that you wouldn't say avoiding triggering someone's PTSD is babying them so why can't you extend that logic to not wanting to misgender people. \n\nTo address the second part of argument 2, the comparison between asking what someones pronouns are and asking what someones phobia or PTSD triggers are isn't analagous. Phobias and PTSD can be triggered by anything so it's impossible to predict what subjects or behaviours to avoid. Everyone has pronouns, the same way everyone has a name. The reason you ask people for their name is so you know what to call them. Think of it the same way for pronouns. Now imagine if being called the wrong name could be potentailly triggering or very upsetting to some people. That would be another reason to want to make sure you know everyone's name. In a world where trans and nonbinary identities are becoming more accepted and normalized it's increasingly likely that people you meet might have pronouns that you don't expect or don't know just by looking at them. \n\nThere is one instance where it can be harmful that u/Xylotophone mentioned. So it is generally good to use the ask everyone or ask no one rule.\n\nIn conclusion, it doesn't hurt anyone and it's not very hard. And guess what, you don't have to ask for pronouns. There are many situations where it's not necessary. But in many situations it can have positive impacts and help people feel safe so I don't see why you are so completley opposed to the idea.",

I am a trans woman, and I, due to my situation, still present masculine, most of the time correcting people about their use of he/him pronouns just isn't worth it, my interactions with 99% of people are limited to 60 seconds. If I am in a conversation with someone I am interested in having a kinship with, I normally eventually state something like \"...by the way, I go by she/her pronouns...\". In my experience, I have never gotten offended by someone assuming my pronouns to be he/him. What *is* offensive however is the reaction that is given when you correct someone. The nice thing about someone asking your pronouns, or presenting their own, is simply that you don't need to guess if they are going to be an accepting person or not. I get one of two responses when I correct people on my pronouns, which are either \"Oh, sorry, I didn't know\" and they fix it right away, that is the right response, at least in my personal opinion. The other response is the \"Oh I don't conform to your agenda\" \"Stop being a snowflake\" \"I don't change my vocabulary\" or \"Oh, I'm sorry, ***she*** (and then continues to use the wrong pronouns and \"correct\" it by saying this *every time* they address me).  \n\n\nPersonally, I've stopped using gender specific pronouns in conversation, unless I know. At work, instead of a \"Hello Sir/Ma'am\" I usually just say \"hello.\" I've never been seen as disrespectful, in fact, when I worked for my father as a cashier as a teenager, most cis people I said \"ma'am/sir\" to asked me not to, simply because it made them feel old. A vast majority of this is a shift from the norm, transgender people have existed for millennia, however we've only been publicly acknowledged for the last couple decades, and only in a positive light for the last half decade. I recently started watching Futurama again, and the episodes from the early 2000s are incredibly demeaning and transphobic, but show a huge but later episodes and the writer's new show are much better. I also moved a few years ago from Nevada to Texas, and the expected vocab is so different, yet still evolving. Addressing people as \"sir/ma'am\" has gone from necessary to respectful and it's becoming more and more commonplace to not use them in the first place more and more. In NV, I almost never heard \"sir/ma'am\" but here in TX I hear it everywhere, and it's becoming less commonplace even here. I don't think that not assuming someone's pronouns is dumb, I think it's new, and we're in the middle of this particular shift in typical conversation vocabulary, that is, unfortunately, getting blown out of proportion due to the political implications, if transgender people weren't a topic of political debate today, and this was simply cis people saying \"sir/ma'am makes me feel old\" I feel this wouldn't even be a question of debate, but because there is such a heated debate and trans rights have been at the forefront of political discussion lately, it's been made into a much bigger deal that it would have been.",

You call for someone based on the apparent and for the legal papers and if somebody knows your gender then it's based on that. Those are set rules you can't change.\n\n\nAnd most languages unlike English can't be changed because everything is connected to each other and missing with one rule will miss with many other rules. \n\n\nSo yoy are basically changing languages that span over thousands of years just cuz a person is throwing a jissy fit because they have mental issues....",

Asking for pronouns is normalizing asking for pronouns, and therefore it won't be awkward or worry other people that you're trying to be hypersensitive.\n\nI can't speak for anyone else so I'll speak for myself. I ask pronouns not because I'm hypersensitive or trying to baby trans people. It's because I used to get misgendered. A LOT. It was extremely damaging to my mental health, because I used to get bullied for having feminine mannerisms, a feminine shape, and now people saw me as feminine enough that they'd assume I'm a woman. It destroyed my image of myself, and pushed me so far in denial of who I am and not being normal that I projected my insecurities by hating myself for being bisexual and hating trans people for being 'weird'.\n\nThis isn't everyone's story, but it's mine. And it's why I always ask. You never know what someone else is going through, or what their pronouns are. Period. You can make educated guesses, but you could also be wrong. And I don't want to add on to any trauma that some people might be experiencing over their presentation, regardless of it's intentional or not.\n\nMy personal discomfort when people look at me weird or think I'm overworrying for asking pronouns is far outweighed because I personally know how it feels to be constantly misgendered, and I'd like to avoid that for every person I possibly can. I default to they/them, just like we usually do when we don't know their gender, until I ask or they offer.\n\nThere's also a hidden pro for everyone when you ask pronouns.

It's not hard, it causes me no distress, and it's an easy way for me to show them that I care.

At several points in your post, you refer to insults, emotional fits, freaking out, and the like.  What if it just hurts a little bit every single time?  I'm not going to go into a detailed explanation of microaggressions here, because there are many good resources available online that can do it better than I can, but if you would like me to help point you in the right direction on that, I can.\n\nWhen you incorrectly assume what a person's pronouns are, it puts them in the position of either having to correct you, which can be socially awkward and uncomfortable, especially if they have to do it all the time, or else having to be referred to by incorrect pronouns, which can be profoundly uncomfortable or even distressing if they are someone who has struggled with their gender identity.  It takes the person who is already in a disadvantaged group in our society, and puts the burden on them to do anything to change it.  And it casts the decision to use correct pronouns as something we are doing *for them*, making it seem like we're going above and beyond rather than extending simple courtesy.  For example, there are a lot of men who would be upset if someone called them \"she\" instead of \"he\"; why should those men be assumed to be more deserving of having their correct pronouns used than someone who is not cisgendered?\n\nI'm going to try to give two analogies that I hope will help illuminate the point.  The first is around another identity marker: religion.  In America, a majority of the population are Christians of some kind.  There are some people who are actively offensive about it, railing against anyone who doesn't believe in their religion, demanding that America be a Christian nation, using their religious views to justify public policy, and so on.  But there are a lot of smaller things, too.  Christianity pervades every aspect of our society.  We get Christmas as a holiday from school or work, but in most places, Rosh Hashanah, Eid al-Fitr, and various other major holidays from other religions are not days off.  God has been inserted into many secular aspects of our culture, from money to the Pledge of Allegiance to the way we curse.  There are still blue laws in several states.  And so on.  For someone who is not Christian, there are constantly reminders of how they are outside the mainstream, ranging from mild discomforts to significant obstacles to daily life.  If we assume everyone is Christian, and make the people who are not Christian push back for equality, then they hold all the burden.\n\nThe second analogy is going to go in a completely different direction.  When you go through a spring-loaded door, and there is someone directly behind you, do you hold the door for them, at least to the point where you can confirm that they have either cleared the door or reached out to hold it themselves?  The societal norm is yes, this is the polite and correct thing to do.  Are you obligated to hold the door for someone else?  No.  Should someone be aware that a door is spring-loaded and prepare themselves to catch it?  Probably.  But are there going to be a few people who get smacked in the face with a door if people don't follow this norm?  Absolutely.  The burden on the front person who has to hold the door is much, much less than the impact on the rear person who gets hit with a door when they don't expect it.  So even if we think each person is responsible for their own safety, we still hold the door, to avoid the unlikely case where someone gets hurt.  Bringing this back to pronouns, if you assume someone's pronouns, the mostly likely outcome is that they will correct you.  But there will be a significant number of people who are hurt by it.  If we can avoid that hurt with an extremely minor effort on our parts, why wouldn't we do it?",

It is effectively a societally informed guess of what a woman, man or nonbinary person might look like. Now this works the vast majority of the time but that is its only real merit. \n\nThe minute you encounter someone like me who has been called mam and sir in interactions minutes apart (And this was when I was trying to present as a woman and clearly not succeeding to the degree I wished) it puts the social burden of correction onto the person you potentially misgendered. Not only is it wildly uncomfortable for me to correct you because nonbinary pronouns aren't always accepted by a lot of people, it also doesn't feel very good because thats what misgendering feels like. Now I am never angry with people. I either let the interaction slide because it is short, or respond to someone I wish/need to spend time with of how I wish to be referred to and assume they operate in good faith. \n\nThe best alternative to make social interaction better for the people who are most likely to be harmed by this mode of gender assumption, trans people. Is to have pronouns be a normal part of introductions and try not to assume pronouns. This normalizes people whose presentation don't comport with the societally informed ideas of gender and acts as a social lubricant for these people. \n\nThis approach does have the major limitation in that it is kind of obnoxious for short interactions like at the store and there I just want to get out of the store as soon as possible instead of explaining gender theory and my identity to the cashier. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo the biggest issue with your argument is shifting the social burden of potential misgendering to the person you are describing to the point of discomfort and potentially pain.",

            "text": "I think that gender has been given way too much power in modern society. Because of that, pronouns have been given a lot of power. Calling someone \"Sir\" or \"Ma'am\" carries a fair amount of meaning, and using the wrong one can actually put trans or gender-nonconforming people in a very tough spot. If I'm a trans woman who generally passes as a woman (meaning, when people see me, they assume I'm a woman) and I'm out with coworkers or some other people who are involved in my life but who may not know I'm trans, and you call me \"Sir\" OR ask about my pronouns, suddenly everyone I'm with is looking at me and questioning my assigned sex, or simply considering why someone might think I'm a man. That is not a situation I would want to be in.\n\nWhile I generally do assume everyone's pronouns in my own mind, and if I'm talking to a friend about a stranger I'll usually assume their pronouns, I try to wait in conversation until an indication of a person's pronouns has been given before using gendered terms to refer to them. There actually aren't many situations where you *have* to use gendered pronouns for someone - you can use their name, you can use gender neutral terms if you don't know their actual pronouns yet (Calling someone \"them\" in conversation when you don't know their pronouns is actually really common; we don't notice it much until we're trying to do it consciously). But really, if you're talking to someone one-on-one, there's no need to use gendered pronouns for them. You'll be calling them \"you.\" You use gendered pronouns almost entirely when you're talking *about* someone, and here's where my issue is - I think we assume way too much about strangers in general. \n\nWe gossip about people we see on the street or in a cafe, and we talk about them while they're in earshot, often in ways that are really presumptuous and sometimes objectifying or otherwise rude. If you're saying someone who passed by is wearing a cute shirt, sure, it doesn't really matter how you refer to the person, you're just saying something vaguely nice about what they're wearing. And if you've recently met someone and are talking to a mutual acquaintance about the person, I don't blame you for assuming the person's pronouns. In fact, as I mentioned before, asking about a person's pronouns can be just as bad as assuming the wrong ones - it's calling their assigned sex & gender into question by either admitting you can't tell what they were assigned at birth or assuming their assigned sex and gender identity may be different.\n\nSo, the main ways assuming pronouns becomes in issue are 1) when you purposely continue to use the wrong pronouns after you've learned what pronouns the person actually uses, 2) when you assume a person's pronouns based on criteria that don't make sense in the modern world (like if someone in every way looks like a woman but has a more prominent adam's apple than most women), especially if you're doing so to purposely try to out people as trans or gender nonconforming, 3) when you're gossiping in an inconsiderate way (especially if you could easily be overheard), or 4) when guessing wrong (or even right, but referring to someone who isn't using those pronouns publicly yet) could endanger the person.\n\nThe problem is, you generally have no idea whether that last one could be the case. Maybe a closeted trans guy is out with their parents and is dressed somewhat masculinely and you (accurately) assume they identify with male pronouns, so you call them \"Sir.\" His parents could suddenly look at him and decide the way he's dressing is too masculine and they need to enforce more rules about him dressing \"like a girl.\" Maybe a 'stealth' trans woman (just meaning she passes as/is read as a woman) is out with friends, not all of whom know she's trans, and you call her \"Sir,\" and someone who hears this is deeply transphobic and is suddenly angry because they feel they've been \"tricked\" into thinking she's a \"real woman\" (ugh) and either resent and avoid her from there on out, which could have really negative social repercussions for her, or actually verbally or physically attack her. Being outed is a really scary thing, and while it's unlikely that we as a society are gonna stop outing people (intentionally or unintentionally), it's a kindness to try to avoid doing so. If you're trans and you don't \"pass\" perfectly in every situation, it's like navigating a minefield just trying to exist in public. \n\nMost trans people know that they will probably be misgendered at least once on a given day if they're out in public enough (because most trans people, and especially trans women, do not pass 100%), and this actually manifests in really debilitating social anxiety and even panic disorders for a lot of trans people. And it's not akin to being socially anxious because of irrational fears about something horrible happening - horrible things happen to trans people because they were identified as trans *all the time*. It's not something that they should have to live with, it's not right that trans people live in a world that doesn't protect them. So we should make an effort to at least avoid giving them more of a reason to feel unsafe, and especially to avoid putting them in harm's way.",

Because it makes the world shittier for everyone.\n\nRead this article: https://judedoyle.medium.com/the-wrong-questions-9d07d1cedfca\n\nImportant excerpt:\n\n> You can seek to limit an idea, if you believe it’s dangerous. You can disagree with an idea, or counter it with a better one. You can push ideas into the margins. But people are not ideas, and when you disagree with a person’s existence, the only thing you can do is to try to make them not exist any more.",

In my opinion asking someone what their pronouns are should become a socially normal thing, like asking them their name (you could even just combine the questions, \"Oh cool I like baseball too, what are your name and pronouns?\" rather than \"Oh cool I like baseball too, what's your name?\") It isn't a huge change to the way people interact, and it helps to make trans people more comfortable at no cost to anybody.",

Because of the difficulty in determining offense in the other person, a false categorizing of ‘over sensitive’ would increase the division between your good intention and their good intention (assuming it was a misunderstanding over offendedness, and you both meant well, but they were just correcting you.) \nThe aim then would be lost to bridge between what the language would specify as ‘difference’ between you, and leave an assumption that the bad-feeling was based on no care about acknowledging that difference. They may actually be offended, but often- people who react are better-off if someone gives a balanced response in return, that leaves it open- judging someone as offended is an actual basis for offense, and holding someone as overly sensitive more so.
