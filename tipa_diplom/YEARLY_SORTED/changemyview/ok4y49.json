    "CMV: The US media frequently uses propaganda to turn lower and middle class groups of people against themselves\nThe powers that be are terrified of what a unified lower and middle class focused on bettering their communities are capable of. They fracture communities by making the groups of people within them believe that they are fundamentally different and have reason to hate each other with identity politics and Omni-channel propaganda. You can‚Äôt look something up on google without getting targeted clickbait designed to make you angry shoved in your face.

And of course, Fox News discovered that when you target someone who is even slightly leaning to the right, you can scandalize them with all kinds of stuff about the left. Universal healthcare will turn us into Venezuela (and not Norway) has been one common team. That was so successful that the other media followed suit and started targeting those leaning to the left. Trump gave them ample opportunities to scandalize their target audience and they took it. It is not a coincidence that CNN viewership fell so dramatically after Biden took office.

            "text": "TL;DR: You are hypothesizing a central cause, but the problem is actually the product of mostly distributed dynamics.\n\n(Sorry this is so long...)\n\nFirst, I think that a lot of what you say about the function of the media - what it does, in practice - is broadly accurate. So we agree on that.\n\nThe place where I think your analysis goes wrong is in assuming that there is such a thing as 'the media' and 'the powers that be' that can act in a unitary way. We can look at media at multiple levels to see what I mean. At the broadest possible level, there are a lot of media outlets in the United States focused on a myriad of things. Surely some of them don't function in the way you describe and surely you would concede that. (Think of independent newspapers or local newspapers in some area where you think the political discourse is more to your liking.)\n\nSo right there, we have to qualify your statement by only applying it to a subset of the media. Perhaps this is a dominant and hegemonic subset. Fine...\n\nSo let's look just at the mainstream media. Are you arguing that Rachel Maddow at MSNBC somehow has her show coordinated with Tucker Carlson at FoxNews? How would that work? Do you think they're both in on it...you take this side, I'll take that one, and we'll divide and conquer? When they go and hire staff...do they bring this up in the interview? \"Just so you know...\"\n\nI don't think that's very credible. But, you could argue that they are co-ordinated in another way. The could be hierarchically coordinated...each of these organizations is part of conglomerates and those conglomerates have elites at the top of the organization. It is isn't unreasonable that these people know each other, have common interests, etc. The question then becomes: is there any evidence of that? If these coordinated efforts were going on, wouldn't instructions have to be communicated down the organization? Why aren't there leaks about that? Memos? Expos√©s? How do these organizations make sure that they only hire people who will keep up the conspiracy?\n\nAnother way in which an organization might be coordinated hierarchically is through incentives...we punish you if you get out line and we reward you if you do the things we want you to do. It's almost definitionally true that this happens. So, the questions now become: (i) is there evidence of this sort of coordination leading to that kind of messaging, (ii) how purposeful could coordination in a system like this be? I encourage you to look at the work of John Dickerson. He's hosted Face The Nation and he's done some other projects. He's a mainstream media guy. He doesn't match the sort of propaganda you're describing. What about David Brooks? He's pretty kumbaya...if a bit tedious. So why would the mainstream media tolerate guys like that if they're set up to do the sort of thing you're describing?\n\nSo, to recap: the media isn't ONE thing, so it can't do ONE thing purposefully, there is no credible evidence of a mainstream media conspiracy and we haven't identified any mechanisms through which the folks at the top could have the sort of control over their organizations that your argument requires.\n\nOk....but your argument does FEEL right, so what gives? There are two other forms of coordination...they just aren't purposeful. \n\nThe first is incentives-based and other people have brought this up....every commercial media outlet has an incentive to drive up viewership and the most reliable way to do that is to scare that audience and engage their negative partisanship. THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM. But it has a distributed cause, not a central one. (Mind you, someone else argued that media outlets have as a goal to establish complete marketshare...that doesn't actually explain the situation you're describing, though. We know what a more concentrated media environment looks like from the mid-20th century: it's pretty vanilla because if you want a lot of viewers, then you can't afford to offend anyone. Once an audience that big is no longer an option, though....then you need a very committed audience. The reasons for this shift are regulatory and technological.)\n\nThe second form of coordination is idealogical. Everyone says the same sort of thing because they believe the same sorts of things because they were socialized in similar settings and share similar experiences. THIS IS ALSO A PROBLEM and it is clearly SYSTEMIC. This is where the sort of playground-elite background of a lot of people in the media is a real issue. But we don't need conspiracies to understand how elite institutions replicate privilege and how elite media institutions tend to bring in people from an elite background. That's a pretty standard dynamic.",

The \"common purpose\" is what people think they find in their subgroups, and react to all others as being hateful or wrong.\n\nThe default is much more exclusionary, and it's a learned behavior that requires thought to be inclusive.

With a history of successful manipulation like that, the \"powers that be\" have no more reason to be terrified than people that live downstream of a dam or ones that are driving across a bridge do.\n\nIt's also naive to think that the mass media manipulation needs to get people to focus on \"each other's differences\" in order to manipulate them.\n\n\"... Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in every country.\"\n-- Herman G√∂ring",

            "text": "This is a classic ‚Äútheory‚Äù where you state ideas that technically can‚Äôt be proven false but have no evidence at all. It feels good to believe stuff like this because it vilifies a lot of peoples current position and sets you above all the other ‚Äúsheeple‚Äù who can‚Äôt see the truth.\n\nOf course I can‚Äôt prove it wrong, but let‚Äôs go through what you‚Äôre suggesting. There must be a secret society of super rich people that are actually scared of this conspiracy theory that middle and lower class people will revolt and take ‚Äúwhat they deserve‚Äù from the more well off people, even though every single time this has happened in history has resulted terrible and eventually reverts back to capitalism. \n\nIt assumes this secret society of the super rich have been in cahoots for a long time, atleast a century now. And every single time the hands are changed over or a company is bought by someone else or is passed to someone else this new person is perfectly fine with the secret society and agrees with the idea of oppressing over half of all Americans. Inb4 they‚Äôre forced to do it! Inb4 the billions of dollars that warren buffers Elon musk Jeff bezos bill gates etc is all just for show to convince the people that they actually care! It‚Äôs just too hard to believe there has never been one whistleblower before his death bed and all this philanthropy and all the money  these people have given and the charities they‚Äôve created is just for show and it‚Äôs all really just in agreeance with the super rich secret society who has a master plan to continue to trick the sheeple. Yet countless of these billionaires were apart of the sheeple middle lower class for half their lifetime. \n\nHow did all these majors news stations get power in the first place? They literally are at the will of the people. If their ratings go down they will lose all of their power. The stock holders of literally own the companies and all they care about is profits. Do you think cnn wanted to play Donald Trump every other second in the 2016 primaries? They had to because he was always the big story that got people to turn it on. Big inb4 they did it because all the news stations are in cahoots and they wanted trump to win because that‚Äôs how they can tear the middle and lower class apart because all the rich people are in a secret society that foresaw the lower class of people rising up so they knew exactly how to buy/ make all the major popular news outlets so they could brain wash them. It actually sounds funny when you say it.\n\nThe middle class is light years away from revolting, there‚Äôs no so reason for the rich to be scared of this at all. The US has the fourth highest wage in the world. Yes that‚Äôs above all the beloved Scandinavian countries! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage?wprov=sfti1 and is number 6 in highest median income https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/median-income-by-country \n\nThe boring truth is that the US is a very good country economically for even average people and below average people ( or else people wouldn‚Äôt be trying to come here in droves ) compared to other countries. Most people in the United States are happy with where they are and they‚Äôre odds of their life getting better compared to other countries.",
