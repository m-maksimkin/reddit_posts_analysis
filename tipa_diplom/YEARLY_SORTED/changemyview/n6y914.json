    "CMV: Cutlery should be placed at the end of a buffet line\nI'm not sure how strongly people feel about this, but it is definitely something that I've been annoyed by at almost every buffet I've been to. Almost always, cutlery is placed at the beginning of the buffet line, and by the time I get to the end, I realize that I needed to grab a spoon/fork/knife/whatever. Additionally, holding on to cutlery as you attempt to put food on your plate is kind of annoying, and it would be better suited to just grab at the end of the line after your plate is in order. I think that this is silly because a lot of times it isn't obvious what cutlery I'll need at the beginning of the buffet line, so I think it would only make sense to place it at the end.

For one thing, if its closer to the seating area, then anyone can come up, grab an extra (maybe you dropped yours, or forgot to grab one before, or want to do a cool trick that requires three forks) and sit back down without disturbing too many people. In a similar vein, if the staff who put out clean dishes have two different places to go to do that, that's twice as much annoyingly maneuvering around people and twice the chance to drop what they're holding. Also, maybe this is just me, but I would forget to grab the utensils like 40% of the time because I would put the last bit of food on my plate, think \"yes, my plate is full, i'm done now,\" and then quickly walk away to make space for the people behind me.",

But you don't have to carry the soup spoon since you put the big shallow plate under the soup plate (so you don't touch the hot plate with soup, and you can carry your spoon without having to hold it dorectly with your hand).\n\nUsually on the table there should be bread slices, bread sticks and/or small buns. Salt and pepper shakers, and for each seat there should be a cloth napkin, and on each side of napkin cutlery you need for your meal. Closest to the plate from the right there should be 2 big knives, on the left 2 big forks.\n\nThe reason why it is like this, is because people usually go for soup first to start the meal and then we (the servers) take away empty soup plates while the guests go back to the buffet to get more food to bring back in new plates. Then the main course meal. Usually only 1 knife and fork is used but the 2 set is there in case a guest goes back to the buffet again and needs a new set of cutlery. Less work for the servers trying to go around the guests and to bring more cutlery. \n\nAddicionally, there should be ready polished cutlery and arranged napkins so you can fix new seats once the guest leaves, so in turn there will be enough seats for the new incoming guests.",

I get that. I agree. But if our choices are the beginning or the end, then I see one significant flaw:\n\nThe way that cutlery is often distributed in a buffet is generally in bulk fashion; you have some sort of dispenser, or basket, or container that houses all of the cutlery by type. These cutlery are touching other cutlery. Now, when I eat, I'm going to be concerned about the cleanliness of my cutlery; it touches all of my food and it goes in my mouth. What's potentially cleaner? Someone grabbing cutlery as the first thing they touch, or something grabbing cutlery when they've dealt with food - perhaps touching some of the food with their hands - and have handled shared serving devices? I'd rather grab my cutlery at the beginning of a line where people's hands are going to be cleaner.\n\nNow, this is arguing the way that buffets are currently set up and not some potential innovation. If we're going to talk innovative techniques then I would argue that the best way to distribute cutlery at a buffet is going to be to place clean cutlery wrapped up at each table when it's cleaned so that we don't have to worry about carrying cutlery with us at all.",

And let me tell you, I have had the same thought. \n\nAnd yet, there is some sort of lizard brain sort of thing that takes over when people are loading up a plate of food to gorge themselves on. I don't know…they get stupid. I tried various arrangements with the napkins and cutlery. \n\nIf the cutlery was at the end of the line, inevitably I would see some friends attempting to eat salads and crumbly desserts with their fingers or by tipping the bowl to their mouths. I don't have stupid friends, but I swear there is something about being hungry and anticipating all that food that turns off the smart parts of your brain. \n\nHaving napkins at the beginning or the end of the line didn't seem to matter. Either way, there were people who didn't see them in about equal proportions. And napkins were something that women would tend to go back for if they forgot or needed another. Men would tend to just stick with whatever they ended up with on the first go-through until they went up for seconds and planned a little better. Married men would get handed napkins from their wives regardless of the placement on the buffet.\n\nOh, and also related to the brain shutting down when food is presented… Since we often ate in the backyard when the weather was nice, I would use something to hold down the napkins from the wind. I have this lovely half-geode that my parents bought when they were just dating. It is about the size of a half of a baseball. It was perfect for holding down napkins. Well, after the third party where I found the geode on the lawn and napkins flying around, I gave up on the geode. Apparently the lizard brain just goes, \"Rock, ground. Move there.\" Lizard brain is unaware of wind.",
