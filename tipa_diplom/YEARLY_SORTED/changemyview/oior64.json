    "CMV: For environmental reasons it should be acceptable and even respectable to wear old, worn clothes\n\n\nThe production of clothes consumes resources and generates pollution. Hence one of the things we can do to protect the environment is to buy less new clothes and use our existing clothes for longer. I am not interested in discussing what fraction of our environmental footprint this constitutes. This is just one of many things we can do to help the environment, and every little thing helps.\n\nUnfortunately this is not always socially acceptable. Wearing worn clothes looks like a sign of poverty and can get you discriminated against. This is perhaps especially bad in a professional environment. Customers and business partners can be unwilling to do business with someone whose employees dress like poor people. This is incentivizes employers to pressure their employees and prospective employees to dress up. This is a negative-sum arms race that harms the environment.\n\nWe should not discriminate against people who wear worn clothes (within reason). Instead of assuming that the person is poor or lazy, it is better to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they might be environmentally conscious.\n\nFancy new clothes should be thought of as a luxury, not a social necessity.\n\nThe environmental benefit may be small, but it is still worth it.\n\n**EDIT 1**: I've given a delta already for the argument that it's good to buy quality clothes that last longer.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Some people seem to think that I am trying to outlaw new or fancy clothes. That is not what I said. I just want it to be socially acceptable to wear clothes that are neither new nor fancy.": [

Getting a new and better \"x\" thing every month or every year is often a literal way to simply flex wealth and usually takes little consideration to the side effects. \n\nThat being said, there is nothing unique about clothes working like this. It's a universal deal. So I am not sure there's much merit in zeroing in on the clothing industry regarding this. \n\nAnd honestly, I do not think that this approach is really the social norm for two reasons:\n\n1. I think that more people than you are giving credit to are wearing the majority of their wardrobe until items lose function. Until they start to fail at warmth, comfort, water-resistance, or the general ability to maintain or keep generally clean. \n2. Also, there is a difference between nice clothes and new clothes. Most wouldn't look down on someone for the \"age\" of their outfit... without a fashion marker you probably can't even tell age most of the time. Or age may even make it work better, depending. It is the condition or style of clothing that someone is going to judge. I can spend 10x as much as you for a pair of pants but my intent actually be to own pants that I can wear for much longer while they maintain fit form or function. In fact, I might even think that more average people are spending a little extra money for a brand known for higher wear quality, comfort, or duration of life than to simply look more extravagant than another or to replace something they have already worn a few times. Alternatively, there are a lot of people (that I see and probably judge) that will buy new clothes more often than they need to in order to feel or look cooler, but they are buying cheap or knockoff junk, and anyone paying attention can tell. Poorer people, as you bring up, are a different example of this. If you can only afford cheaper materials that don't last as long, it will be harder to maintain these items and you will need new items more often. At least generally speaking. So in that case spending less on clothing could be worse for the environment long term, not to mention that you can literally also pay more for more enviro-conscious brands that mind this issue from fabrication to your home. \n\nSo yes there is definitely consumerism and marketing always suggesting at people to buy new things and throw away the old. But that doesn't make the idea of \"new clothes\" or \"nicer clothes\" bad for the environment across the board. That's just peer pressure working.",
