I’m not debating the legality of religious exemptions. I’m questioning the sincerity of those who use the Bible as grounds for opposing vaccines]**": [

There's plenty of documentation that explains the process of this so I won't go into that. But if you have a religious issue with abortion, there's a valid point that the vaccine was developed from it.\n\nNow, this doesn't mean it's automatically a sin to get the shot. Not at all. My pastors got it and yet they agree with me on this point and the validity of my claim. One can argue that the vaccine is something good that was brought out of something bad. Absolutely, I don't fault any Christian who decided to get the vaccine.\n\nHowever, my conscience is against using anything that comes from or supports abortion. In Romans 14, Paul is discussing questions he's received about whether it's OK to eat meat in the market that was from animals sacrificed to idols, and we see that Paul says it is OK to do so, it's just meat and you aren't the one sacrificing to idols. He does, however, point out in verse 14 that although it isn't unclean in and of itself, it is unclean for anyone who thinks it is. \n\nThis passage, as well as 1 Corinthians 8, 1 Corinthians 10:28, is where we get the idea of \"Christian liberty\" as some call it. The same concept that applies to drinking alcohol. It isn't a sin to partake, but if your conscience tells you it is wrong and you go against that conscience to partake, you have sinned. These passages go on to say that if you have the stronger conscience and don't have an issue with it, you are not to cause your weaker brothers to stumble in it, as it would be a sin for them. And those who have the weaker conscience should not shame the stronger for being ok with it.",

Many people do have legitimate concerns about the way the government is running the country. That’s what you have to understand. It isn’t the vaccine, it’s more “should I get an injection being forced on me by a government I do not trust?” That’s an question we have all had to come to grips with, and for many individuals, the answer is “no.”\n\nAs far as work is involved, the religious exemption policy comes from the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, which says employers must make reasonable accommodations for employees who object to work requirements because of “sincerely held” religious beliefs.\n\nOf course, how do you work out who is sincere?

Just that you “know the Bible and Christian doctrine well”.\n\nI would say you are most likely someone that left faith at some point.  Going out on a limb and say Catholic.  But, I would say you are not a practicing Christian today.  Otherwise, I feel some of your statements would be different.\n\nHere is my ultimate response…\n\nThe Bible is all about emphasis.  Take Baptists, you emphasis getting baptized almost over communion or other sacraments.  Almost to a fault.  Anyone that takes one part of the Bible to “prove their point”, will almost always fail.\n\nSecond, no the Bible doesn’t say… Thou Shall Not Inject Vaccines Into Yourself…  Vaccines nor the knowledge to understand something like the flu or Covid didn’t exist.  Let’s just say that even if Jesus was aware of Covid in his time… He might not have even said anything about it… NOR would it have been important enough for someone (like Paul) to write it down.  You have to understand the value of paper and writing down the history and story of Jesus in those times.  He didn’t have a person with a laptop typing all his words down.\n\nThe Bible is supposed to help direct you in life.  It doesn’t contain ALL the answers.  Your personal relationship with God is also an important part.  It’s very hard to understand if you haven’t developed that relationship over time.  Heck, I wouldn’t even claim that I have.  I have a lot of personal experiences of “feeling” a certain way in a particular moment… and maybe doing something because of it… only to find out later, it was the right thing to do…. Example… I was walking down the street with my dog years ago.  There was a girl walking the opposite way.  Something just told me to say something.  We talked for maybe 3 minutes max.  Months later, she told me that she was thinking about killing herself that night.  Had a plan and everything… Mainly because she felt “nobody saw her”… The fact that I stopped to talk to her made her realize that people do care, and she “was seen”…. All because I had “a feeling”…\n\nSure claim it’s just something random… but I tell you, I have had more of those moments…\n\nAnyway… back to vaccines…\n\nI am vaccinated… I wasn’t super into it at first…. BUT, I would NEVER tell someone to do something that they don’t want to do… if I had a church friend tell me that they prayed over it and decided not to get it… I would respect it… just like they would respect my decision to get it…. I personally think that is more “love thy neighbor” then looking down on someone for their decision…. All this talk of people not getting vaccinated should t be allowed to eat in a restaurant or even leave their house to work… that doesn’t seem “love thy neighbor” to me… We all sin… None of us are perfect… we still love them anyway, just like I hope they love me with my sins and imperfections…",

You should probably understand that Christian doctrine is also not solely sourced from the Bible. Plenty of the Bible contains parable and teachings that influence plenty moral positions within the Church without ever explicit mentions. Therefore that cannot be the benchmark by which you must measure the validity of religious opposition.\n\nWhat you can take as the benchmark is the actual doctrine of the religions. I will not comment on any further than the Catholic Church as that is my experience, it is very much \"frowned upon\" in the cases of [embryonic cells utilised in the development](https://theconversation.com/cells-from-human-foetuses-are-important-for-developing-vaccines-but-theyre-not-an-ingredient-157484) of vaccines. [Current doctrine](https://www.cbcew.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/03/catholic-position-on-vaccination-110820.pdf) suggests it is morally permissible to receive certain vaccine that **in the past** utilised this methodology. The basis of the opposition from what I recollect is the position of the Church in regards to life beginning at conception. As the R&D of certain vaccines utilise the stem cell lines of aborted foetuses, this is viewed as morally impermissible as murder.\n\nIn regards to the current circumstances, at least for the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, they are [perfectly fine to receive](https://www.cacatholic.org/CCC-vaccine-moral-acceptability) as they use a different technique altogether.\n\nSo your understanding of even the Christian viewpoint is lacking. The Bible is the Holy book but not the entirety of the Christian doctrine. Each sect has additional doctrinal texts or teachings dependent on the Patriarch or Pope etc. \n\nAnd if you want a realpolitik answer, there are religious exemptions enacted in regards to vaccination programs, thereby disproving your claim that they don't exist (different from they shouldn't exist or are based in weak principle).",

So if a christian believes it is a sin to do something, then they necessarily are right (so far as it pertains to their own sinfulness). Therefore, to make them violate their conscience by engaging in that behavior is akin to making a muslim eat bacon. \n\nAs far as religious exemptions go, there is a lot of legal precedent to establish what should qualify, but it generally shakes out like this (and iirc, this is called “the Lemon test”): \n\n1) is there a sincerely held religious belief. If so, then…\n\n2) is there a compelling state interest in violating it?  If not, then give exemption. If so, then…\n\n3) is this the least restrictive means of achieving that interest?  If no, then exemption. If so, then *maybe* not, depending on other vague or subjective factors (including a judgement call about how “compelling” the state’s interest is, and if that justifies violating someone’s religious rights). \n\nIf we apply this standard to a covid “vaccine” mandate, then easily anyone who objects to a jab should be exempt. Aside from the longstanding precedent of people having the right to decide for themselves what medical treatment to get or not, the fact of the existence of any treatment options (even if you want to rail against hydroxychloroquine or ivermectin, monoclonal antibodies have been very effective) means that forcing vaccines is not the least restrictive means of mitigating against the public health crisis of covid. And that is even if you could make the argument that such a “crisis” were compelling enough to violate religious liberties (if there weren’t any viable treatment options available), which is highly dubious, given that covid is less deadly than the flu for most people and that so many people are already voluntarily “vaccinated” and therefore (presumably) protected.",

The concept of a \"Christian\" really doesn't exist. If I had time I'd like to post one of these saying there is no such thing as a universal Christian. \nIf you got a Baptist, Catholic, Lutheran, Methodist, Anglican in the same room together you could find lots of things they do not agree on. And I've only covered a small fraction of the different sects. Southern Baptists are different from Canadian Baptists. I grew meeting lots of very liberal minded Lutherans until I moved to Iowa and met people who are part of the Missouri Synod. Some of these folks I've talked to are farther right than some Southern Baptists I met in Alabama. I think in a universal sense the only thing you could use to describe a Christian would be they believe Jesus died on a cross and he did it for us all. If you start adding more to it you might start getting disagreements.\nAS far as your idea about religious restrictions. Plenty of sects of Christianity have rules against you doing things. People like to bring up the blood transfusions and JWs. I grew up Catholic. Didn't eat meat on Fridays except for fish. Is that on par with taking a vaccine? No probably not but its something that really doesn't have anything to do with that actual faith. But when my wife and I were trying IVF to have kids, she was reading up on some stuff she got from her sister (ultra catholic) about the church's views. There is a lot of crap in that literature. I have been done with religion for years but that just really ticked me off. The church's position on \"creating life\" is that god does it and man should not interfere. So getting sperm and putting together with a harvested egg is a big No No. Unless you use a ton of loop holes. To collect the sample of the man he has to use a condom with a hole in it or something like that. And the doctors have to put the sperm in the same dish as the egg and let god do his work. Otherwise they are interfering in god's plan.\nEvery faith has their stupid rules. People can expand and stretch those stupid rules to claim lots of things are against the rules. Most mainstream christian based faiths have all stated that vaccines are good in the past. There has been some controversy around the use of fetal cells. But I've never heard the official stances by the different faiths governing bodies saying \"nope, can't use that one\". I bet the Southern Baptist Convention would probably come out in favor of the COVID vaccine if it came to a vote but then they would end up with a schism because of all the wackos.\nJust my opinion.

That scripture that you quoted just now comes from that particular book. “For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.” \n\nI’m carefully following the format of your CMV.\n\nI did not grow up in Church, but I have been attending one for about 5 years so this is something that we have been talking about for a while now. \n\nAct 17:11 \nThese were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.\n\nThe reality of this whole faith conversation is that it’s more than “The Bible is the word of God therefore love”. \nThere are over 2,000 different doctrines just in the US alone. I will only speak about and for one. \n\nYou are right that the Bible does have a priority in Love, but that doesn’t mean what you think it does either. One scripture for example says Love is telling the truth to some who might be in darkness. (Euphemism for being ignorant or just not knowing something. \n\nHere’s the truth. Jesus is coming back. The Bible says and talks about a second coming and judgment. \n\nWhy are we talking about a judgment? Because before that day “the day of the Lord” the Bible prophesies about a certain figure. Two of them actually. A false prophet and an anti-Christ. These two will implement a system that effects finances. \nLong story short because it’s really long winded. The vaccine being mandated some feel is like a sort of prelude to this mark.

Some have chosen to\nbe anti-Covid vaccine because they feel like this is how they can train their mind to condition themselves to be anti mark.\n\nWhat that mark will be is heavily debated. \nYou’ll receive a different answer depending that that persons denomination.",

Of course, none of us wanted to have dangerous chemicals sprayed in our homes, but the reality of the situation was that we needed to treat most, if not all, of the units for the treatment to be effective. Why should the refusing residents get a cockroach-free home at the expense of their neighbors who risked their health? Ultimately, we instituted a $500 fine if you continued to refuse to let the exterminator spray your unit. Of course, we made exceptions for health reasons such as if someone was sick, pregnant, or elderly.
