    "CMV: Politicians spreading vaccine disinformation should be held legally responsible.\nPoliticians are elected to lead us especially during major events like the current pandemic. Ignoring scientific data from experts and telling citizens not to trust vaccines is literally killing people. These people have influence socially and in the legislation they support. I’m not talking about your crazy uncle on Facebook. He’s not elected or in a position of leadership. I think politicians that give false medical advice that is refutable by science should face legal consequences. Knowingly giving someone an STD is illegal. Spreading false information from a place of leadership and enacting policies that aren’t supported by science needs to have consequences or they will keep doing it. Next time we might be dealing with a virus with much higher deaths rates.\n\nEDIT:\n\nHey folks I’m going to bed soon so don’t expect more posts tonight. I just wanted to clear up some stuff and tell you how I think I can do better. \n\nFirst let me clarify my position. When I say “legal consequences” I don’t mean criminal charges. In my mind it could be them being censured, barred from running again or even civil suits. Jailing politicians is a terrible idea and I wouldn’t support it. Also because this seemed to be an issue…I don’t care if a Democrat or a Republican is the one lying. \n\nI’d also like to talk a bit about my experience here. This has been really interesting and I thank everyone for posting. In the future I’ll definitely word my initial post better. I definitely made some assumptions in terms of us all being on the same page. My wording wasn’t great and I didn’t think everything would be picked apart like it was. That’s fine and I appreciate it in a debate. I want to apologize for getting kind of defensive as well. I definitely got overwhelmed trying to answer everyone. I also gave the trolls way too much of my time and didn’t stick with the quality posts as much. For that I’m sorry. I’ll be better in the future. I also want to apologize for not really knowing the etiquette here. I’m imperfect and always looking to improve. I’ll try to answer posts here and there for the next couple days. I hope you all will welcome me back in the future. \n\nOne last thing, this goes for me too…we’re all so divided politically right now. I really truly hope we can all find some common ground with each other. If you’re pro or anti-vax I hope you all stay safe and healthy during this pandemic. Goodnight and don’t forget to love each other.": [

You say well there's lots of science saying it is but advisor 1 could argue, as the advisor i still believe it isn't for whatever reasons.

            "text": "OP, I’m going to start by saying that I largely agree with your view on covid and vaccines and preventative measures. When the vaccine was made available to me, I got it immediately. I just got over a bout of having covid and being a symptomatic, which I believe is because of the vaccine (based anecdotally on how people related to me reacted to the virus being unvaccinated). So, based on my understanding, I believe that people should get vaccinated and I would like it if politicians saying things that I believe to be misinformation would stop saying those things. (I’m on mobile, so I’m using caps for emphasis as opposed to italics. I’m not yelling lol).\n\nHowever, if you ask me about whether they should be in legal trouble for that, my answer is an unequivocal NO. To specifically address the issue at hand, there is SO MUCH that we don’t know about this virus and these vaccines. Both are brand new and both need further study, years down the road for us to truly know what we’re dealing with. Even basic things many took for granted, such as the effectiveness of masks, are not useful, as many have pointed out in the comments. What I’m saying is that what you and I are taking as fact is not something other people are because of the uncertainty. \n\nWhat I have seen in the comments is a total unwillingness to acknowledge these concerns people have. You have labeled people disagreeing with you as anti-vaxers without seeming to fully read their comments or arguments. You latch on to minor things and go down rabbit holes without actually addressing what people are saying. It seems, from my perspective, you don’t actually want your view changed. \n\nI know that you are having trouble keeping up with all of the arguments people are making. That’s understandable and, honestly, the main reason I never post my own CMVs and just stick to commenting. But you took on this post and owe it to the people engaging with you to give them the respect of reading their arguments. \n\nI think there’s a wider point about the value of dissenting views in a republic and a right of free speech and free protest. But those seem less pertinent than addressing the specifics of covid to actually change your view. \n\nI’ll end with a personal anecdote to again show you that my sentiments lie with you. I lost my grandfather to covid in April 2020, around the time all of this began. We couldn’t be in the hospital with him, we couldn’t say goodbye in any real way, and we couldn’t have a funeral service. Since then, my mother has suffered crippling anxiety about this virus in a desperate attempt to ensure that no one else she loves is lost in the same way as her father (not to mention that my grandmothers dementia has deteriorated significantly since the loss of her husband; she only knows who I am about half the time now). It has been HARD. It SUCKS. I want it to be OVER. But my experience is not everyone else’s. Many people are equally as anxious and scared of new medicine and the potential side effects of that in the face of what is, to them, basically the flu. As much as I value MY experience, I have to also be empathetic to theirs.",
