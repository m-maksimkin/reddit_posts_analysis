    "CMV: The Prophet Muhammad, claimed under Islam as the Most Moral of All Men, was a child rapist.\nThe hadiths make it clear that he took his wife Aisha for marriage when she was 6. Many Muhammad apologists try to say she was actually much older and the Hadiths in question can't be trusted since they aren't \"the word of Allah\".. even though many are first hand accounts of the girl herself. By following the logic that the hadiths can't be trusted  then we would have little to no knowledge of Muhammad himself and also getting rid of the hadiths turns the Quran into mound of disconnected contextless writings. The Hadith's in question :\n\n* Narrated 'Aisha: I used to play with the dolls in the presence of the Prophet, and my girl friends also used to play with me. When Allah's Apostle used to enter (my dwelling place) they used to hide themselves, but the Prophet would call them to join and play with me. (The playing with the dolls and similar images is forbidden, but it was allowed for 'Aisha at that time, as she was a little girl, not yet reached the age of puberty.) (Fateh-al-Bari page 143, Vol.13) Sahih Bukhari 8:73:151\n* 'A'isha (Allah be pleased with her) reported that Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) married her when she was seven years old, and he was taken to his house as a bride when she was nine, and her dolls were with her; and when he (the Holy Prophet) died she was eighteen years old. Sahih Muslim 8:3311\n* A’ishah said : I used to play with dolls. Sometimes the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) entered upon me when the girls were with me. When he came in, they went out, and when he went out, they came in.\" Sunan Abu Dawud 4913 (Ahmad Hasan Ref)\n* It was narrated that 'Aishah said: \"The Messenger of Allah married me when I was six, and consummated the marriage with me when I was nine, and I used to play with dolls.\" (Sahih) Sunan an-Nasa'i 4:26:3380\n* It was narrated that 'Aishah said: \"I used to play with dolls when I was with the Messenger of Allah, and he used to bring my friends to me to play with me.\" (Sahih) Sunan Ibn Majah 3:9:198\n* Aisha said she was nine years old when the act of consummation took place and she had her dolls with her. Mishkat al-Masabih, Vol. 2, p 77\n\nMany defenders also like to point to the context at the time being normal for child brides to take place. Agreed! It was! However again he is a prophet and he is the most moral of all men, there is no way to in todays day and age give him a pass and say its ok to that he only be held to the standards of the society around him at the time, He was founding an entire religion, he was a \"holy man\" so he should be rightly held to a higher standard, to which he has failed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*EDIT\\*  Please see my reply to  u/[Subtleiaint](https://www.reddit.com/user/Subtleiaint/) for extensive additional sources\n\n\\*EDIT2\\* Alright been replying for the better part of 4 hours, plenty of good discussions. Also I want to make it clear that while  pointing out that Muhammad may have engaged in some very problematic practices, I'm not attempting to make a blanket commentary on modern day Islam or modern day Muslims, so for those of you that are trying, please stop turning it into that. That said I will have to come back later to continue the discussions and replies.": [

In the Hadith, Aisha mentions getting her periods so we know she had hit puberty and hence, according to the culture and time, it wasn't wrong. \n\nMuhammad was a man of his time and place.

She was ten years older than her sister Aishah (RA).\n\nAsma would have been 27-28 years old at the time of Hijrah and since she was ten years older than Aishah (RA), therefore the age of Aishah (RA) would have been 17 or 18 years at the time of Hijrah.\n\nAccordingly, her birth falls about four or five years before the Call, and her age at the time of the consummation of marriage in 2 A.H. will work out to 18-20 years.”\n\nAnd here’s this which is also supposed to prove that she was indeed much older than nine years old: http://m.hindustantimes.com/india/hazrat-aisha-was-19-not-9/story-G4kaBHqM0VXoBhLR0eI2oO.html \n\nSo according to a couple sources, this proves that Muhammad (SAW) is not indeed a child rapist.\n\nI’m not very well-versed in this topic which is why I derived my answer from online but I’d still like to know where your sources on that she was nine come from?",

            "text": "This piece of misinformation has led to the wrong view that The Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) married a minor. . It must be noted that establishing the authenticity of hadiths, the narrators’ circumstances and the conditions at that time have to be correlated with historical facts. There is only one hadith by Hisham which suggests the age of Hazrat Aisha as being nine when she came to live with her husband.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMany authentic hadiths also show that Hisham’s narration is incongruous with several historical facts about the Prophet’s life, on which there is consensus. With reference to scholars such as Umar Ahmed Usmani, Hakim Niaz Ahmed and Habibur Rehman Kandhulvi, it can be proven that Hazrat Aisha was at least 18. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAccording to Umar Ahmed Usmani, in Surah Al-Nisa, it is said that the guardian of the orphans should keep testing them, until they reach the age of marriage, before returning their property [(4:6)](https://quran.com/4/6) . From this scholars have concluded that the Quran sets a minimum age of marriage which is at least puberty. Since the approval of the girl has a legal standing, she cannot be a minor.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHisham bin Urwah is the main narrator of the hadith that say Hazrat Aisha was a child. His life is divided into two periods: in 131A.H. the Madani period ended, and the Iraqi period started, when Hisham was 71 years old. Hafiz Zehbi has spoken about Hisham’s loss of memory in his later period. His students in Madina, Imam Malik and Imam Abu Hanifah, do not mention this hadith. Imam Malik and the people of Madina criticised him for his Iraqi hadiths.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAll the narrators of this hadith are Iraqis who had heard it from Hisham. Allama Kandhulvi says that the words spoken in connection with Hazrat Aisha’s age were tissa ashara, meaning 19, when Hisham only heard (or remembered), tissa, meaning nine. Maulana Usmani thinks this change was purposely and maliciously made later.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHistorian Ibn Ishaq in his Sirat Rasul Allah has given a list of the people who accepted Islam in the first year of the proclamation of Islam, in which Hazrat Aisha’s name is mentioned as Abu Bakr’s “little daughter Aisha”. If we accept Hisham’s calculations, she was not even born at that time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome time after the death of the Prophet’s first wife, Hazrat Khadija, Khawla suggested to the Prophet that he get married again, to a bikrun, referring to Hazrat Aisha (Musnad Ahmed). In Arabic bikrun is used for an unmarried girl who has crossed the age of puberty and is of marriageable age. The word cannot be used for a six-year-old girl.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome scholars think that Hazrat Aisha was married off so early because in Arabia girls mature at an early age. But this was not a common custom of the Arabs at that time. According to Allama Kandhulvi, there is no such case on record either before or after Islam. Neither has this ever been promoted as a Sunnah of the Prophet. The Prophet married off his daughters Fatima at 21 and Ruquiyya at 23. Besides, Hazrat Abu Bakr, Aisha’s father, married off his eldest daughter Asma at the age of 26.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHazrat Aisha narrates that she was present on the battlefield at the Battle of Badar (Muslim). This leads one to conclude that Hazrat Aisha moved into the Prophet’s house in 1 A.H. But a nine-year-old could not have been taken on a rough and risky military mission.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn 2 A.H, the Prophet refused to take boys of less than 15 years of age to the battle of Uhud. Would he have allowed a 10-year-old girl to accompany him? But Anas reported that he saw Aisha and Umme Sulaim carrying goatskins full of water and serving it to the soldiers (Bukhari). Umme Sulaim and Umme Ammara, the other women present at Uhud, were both strong, mature women whose duties were the lifting of the dead and injured, treating their wounds, carrying water in heavy goatskins, supplying ammunition and even taking up the sword.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHazrat Aisha used the kunniat, the title derived from the name of a child, of Umme Abdullah after her nephew and adopted son. If she was six when her nikah was performed, she would have been only eight years his senior, hardly making him eligible for adoption. Also, a little girl could not have given up on ever having her own child and used an adopted child’s name for her kunniat.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHazrat Aisha’s nephew Urwah once remarked that he was not surprised about her amazing knowledge of Islamic law, poetry and history because she was the wife of the Prophet and the daughter of Abu Bakr. If she was eight when her father migrated, when did she learn poetry and history from him?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is consensus that Hazrat Aisha was 10 years younger than her elder sister Asma, whose age at the time of the hijrah, or migration to Madina, was about 28. It can be concluded that Hazrat Aisha was about 18 years old at migration. On her moving to the Prophet’s house, she was a young woman at 21. Hisham is the single narrator of the hadith whose authenticity is challenged, for it does not correlate with the many historical facts of the time.",

            "text": "Aisha was not simply some six years old girl, she is an extremely important and prominent figure in Islamic history and she lived until she was 66. The source that lists Aisha's age at marriage is a quote by Aisha herself in the authentic books of hadith as you noted. This is not the only quote by Aisha in Islamic heritage. In fact some scholars estimate that we learned about a quarter of all Islamic laws from quotes from Aisha which she heard from the prophet PBUH.\n\nThe hadiths you provided are authentic as far as I know. And they are quotes of discussions between Aisha and the prophet's companions and followers that happened when Aisha was much older. Aisha did not suffer because of her marriage, nor did she hate her life with the prophet. Like I mentioned, she lived until she was 66 and there are dozens of quotes from her that mention how much she loved and respected the prophet, how much she cherished her time with him, and how hurt she was when he passed away. Moreover, Aisha spent her entire life teaching people about Islam and honoring her late husband's message. Someone who was abused would never do that.\n\nAisha was not weak-willed or timid, she was outspoken and she argued a lot with the companions of the prophet about different matters of Islam. She even rode with an army after the third Khalif Othman was assassinated to demand the punishment of his assassins. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is:\n\n1- If Aisha was hurt in any shape or form, she would have let the whole world know. And if you search through all authentic books of hadiths you will never find a single quote by Aisha which belittles or insults the prophet in any shape or form. \n\n2- If Aisha was here, she would be the very first person to stand up for her husband. She did marry young, but I don't know why you are claiming she was raped. She lived many years after the prophet's death, and we have thousands of quotes from her, and yet, there is nothing to proof that she was hurt by the prophet, not to mention raped. \n\nThis marriage happened between Aisha and the prophet and many years after their marriage she was extremely happy that they married by her own admission. The crime you are proclaiming didn't exist and never happened by the admission of the alleged victim herself. \n\nIt is useful to mention here that the prophet offered Aisha the chance for divorce at some point in their relationship, but she refused and told him that he was more precious to her than her mother and father. If she was hurt or hated the prophet then she would have left him given the chance, but she didn't. Moreover, after the prophet died many people left Islam and fought against the Muslims, if she had a grudge against the prophet she would have left with them, but she spoke out against them and remained with the Muslims till she died working for their cause and doing her best to spread Islam.\n\nTo wrap up this topic, several points must be mentioned first. The prophet's first wife (and relationship with a woman) was a 40 years-old-lady (Khadija) that he married when he was 25, and he stayed with her for 25 years during which he didn't marry another woman even though it was religiously and socially acceptable at that time to have more than one wife. The prophet PBUH loved Khadija so much that even after her death he cherished her memory and her old friends. One time Aisha saw him chatting and laughing with an old lady and she grew jealous, turned out it was one of Khadija's old friends and they were remembering about their days together.\n\nAfter Khadija's death, the prophet was extremely sad, so much so that that year was called \"the year of sorrow\". His second wife was a woman called Sawda who was five years his elder and had multiple children from a previous marriage. Pained to watch him mourn and hurt, Sawda offered to marry the prophet a second wife, and she suggested Aisha. The prophet requested to make the official offer and they got married. My point is, the prophet was not the one who came up with the idea to marry Aisha. And when the point was raised he thought nothing of the topic.\n\nActually, no one made any comment on the age difference, not his companions, nor his enemies who were actively trying to kill him. His enemies had been calling him names for years and Khadija died because the Muslims were surrounded and starved by the non-Muslims. They never passed an opportunity to insult the prophet and harm him and yet they didn't bring the age difference between Aisha and Mohammed at all. Why? Those people hated the prophet more than anything and they started several wars to annihilate Muslims. Yet they never called him out on his supposed abuse of Aisha or even thought to mention the marriage in a bad light. You can claim they were bad people and I wouldn't disagree, but Muslims had many enemies over the years and the claims that the prophet PBUH was a pedophile or raped Aisha is a relatively recent accusation.\n\nBack in that time, people used to marry much much younger, especially in Arabia. In fact, Aisha had a fiancée before the prophet which was considered normal. Today, the age of consent is different around the globe. In one country, if an adult had a sexual relationship (not marriage) with a 15 years old that wouldn't be an issue. But if he/she were to travel with the same 15-years-old to another country and do it again he/she would be arrested. Cultures have different definitions and understanding of marriage, and sex, and the relationships between men and women. And while some times these differences are based on things like culture and public view, the Arabs of ancient had a very good reason to marry young. \n\nAisha and the Prophet's marriage happened before the industrial revolution, before electricity became a part of life, before medicine evolved, and before all the advancements of science that we know today which has greatly improved our lives. Ancient Arabs had many dangers to fight against, from diseases to bandits to wars and famine and even wildlife and the weather, the mortality rate was extremely high and it was especially higher for children. Moreover, the strength of a tribe in Arabia was determined by the number of its capable fighters, which made the need for people to marry early even higher. It was a harsh world for both men and women. and children were considered adults much earlier than today's standards. One can claim it was not ideal or perfect, but that was the state of life for people living in the desert 1400 years ago. If those people were to use our modern standards and views regarding sex and marry late then they would have gone extinct. For ancient Arabs, everyone needed to marry young and therefor it was no issue for the prophet to marry Aisha.\n\nToday, if a person would marry young, there is a high chance that he/she would be later negatively affected in life especially if this marriage denied them getting the proper education that would support them in getting a decent job and living. This was the opposite case for Aisha, as she got the most important form of education at her time. She was a renowned Muslim scholar and her marriage elevated her social status greatly.\n\nAisha's marriage to the prophet served an important role for us Muslims. Like I mentioned before, there are hundreds of quotes from Aisha about the prophet. Those quotes teach us Muslims various aspects of Islam, many of which we would never have had the opportunity to learn if it wasn't for Aisha. Her youth and bright mind helped her catch on many of the teachings of the prophet and pass it on to us. A recent book by Dr. Eyad Qunaibi (Also available as a video on his channel, both in Arabic only ATM) with the title \"Nada complains to Aisha\" teaches both the husband and the wife how to handle various issues and problems related to marriage by following the example of the prophet and Aisha. Together, they set an amazing example for how one should treat their spouse, how to handle differences, how to resolve disagreements, how to avoid hurting your loved ones accidentally, and many more points. What I am trying to say is \"We Muslims do not believe that prophet Mohammed PBUH is a role model despite his marriage to Aisha, but we can only consider him as a role model because of his marriage to Aisha.\" As without her we wouldn't have the insight into his every day life to be able to consider him as a role model in the first place.\n\nYou see, before the invention of mobile phones and social media, you will not find any person in history with a record of his life as accurate and detailed as that of prophet Mohammed PBUH, and a huge part of that is credited to Aisha. By the way, hadiths are ranked on a basis of authenticity, and the ones which mention Aisha's age at marriage have the same authenticity rank as the ones which mention how much she cherished her husband. If anyone were to reject the hadiths or suspect their authenticity, then they are by extent doubting the proof that lists Aisha's age at marriage, and therefore, have no claim against the prophet.\n\nFinally, I will mention that during the prophet's life, he was offered several times wealth and beautiful women, on the condition he abandons Islam, and he always refused. If he was a man who desired power, wealth, or women he had had ample chances to get what he wanted and he repeatedly rejected.",

And whoever, \\[when acting as guardian\\], is self-sufficient should refrain \\[from taking a fee\\]; and whoever is poor - let him take according to what is acceptable. Then when you release their property to them, bring witnesses upon them. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.\n\nThe context of this verse is referring on when to give (adopted) orphans their property as they grow up. Notice the language here - the Qur'an mentions the existence of a *\"marriageable age\",* and implies at this *\"marriageable age\"*, these orphans could be feasibly capable of owning their own property and wealth, if they have *\"sound judgement\"* (hence test on whether this is the case or not). No six year old, even the most developed ones, is mature enough to own their own property and wealth. Hence six would not be a *\"marriageable age\"*, further casing doubt on that this was the age of Aisha at her marriage to the Prophet Muhammad.",

            "text": "Here are some of the reasons why this argument is weak:\n                        \n1- we do not set age in Islam. Consent age in liberal philosophy is based on social construct (socially acceptable and favorable). Although social construct can play a role, it is certainly not enough to determine what age to choose and what to leave. Countries globally have different ages of consent. In the west , it can range from 12 years old to 18 years old, or even older. The best approach is the approach of Islam which ties it to 2 points. Reaching biological puberty, and reaching mental maturity. And we know that these things differ from person to person, not only that, but also between both genders\n\n2- additionally Islam does not put restrictions on people choosing to get married later on. Which increasingly becoming the case globally including in Muslim majority countries. In Islam العرف normative and socially favorable behaviour are endorsed as long they are within what Islam allows. \n\n3- people do not realise that the majority of people did not live as long as we live today, due to illnesses, plagues, diseases, famine... etc.... People up to the 18th century lived about  25~30 years old globally on average . It is expected that people would marry earlier than today. Today we live longer, thanks to many things, people also choose to go to universities and get education before starting a family. That and many other factors pushed the favorable age of marriage much more further than what people used before. \n\n4- regardless of any explanations given by Muslims. Islam position on age of consent is much logically coherent, justifiable and in line of science and human biology as well, and better than what liberals give as justification. We will keep holding on our position that age of consent is not set in Islam, however, people and Muslim majority countries may choose what is much more befitting to them and their needs based on العرف normative and socially favorable behaviour (as long it is within what Islam allows). \n\n5- Here some quotes from academics and different literature since we love having evidence of what we are saying!... Just scroll through them,, they are not necessarily directly related to the subject! Now salam! \n\nDr Colin Turner is Islamic Studies and Thought Professor at Durham University. He says on prophet Mohammed marriage to Aisha.... \n\"a marriage between an older man and a younger girl was customary in among the bedouins, as is still is in many societies across the world. It wasn't unheard of that boys and girls promised to marriage to each other almost as soon they were born, particularly if the union was of direct political significance to families concerned. However, such marriages were almost certainly not consummated until both parties have entered adulthood, which Arabs at 7th century tended to reach at an earlier age than westerners today. It is highly unlikely that Muhammad would've taken Aisha into his bed until she was at least in her early teens, which is holy and keeping with the customs of the day, and in context, not in the least improper\" page 34-35, in Islam The Basics \n\n\"There is no impropriety in Muhammad betrothal to to Aisha. Marriages conducted in absentia to seal an alliance were often contracted at this time between adults and minors who were even younger than Aisha. This practice continued in Europe until well into the early modern period. There is no question of consummating the marriage until Aisha reached puberty, when she will be married of like any girl\" \nFrom the book... Muhammad: A Prophet for Our Time Book by Karen Armstrong (Christian theologian and author) \n\n\n\"A year after his wife death, as the priest announced through Judia, that they wish to find in the tribes of Judia a respectable man to espouse Mary, then 12 to 14 years of age. Joseph who was at that time 90 years old went up to Jerusalem among the candidates\" from the Catholic encyclopedia in new advent website 1995\n\n\n\"Age of concent throughout history has usually coincided with the age of puberty. Although sometimes it was early as seven. Early on, age of consent was a familial or a tribal matter, and only become a legal one at the Greco-Roman period. The roman traditions served as the base for Christian Europe as well as the Christian Church itself, which generally essentially based on biological development at 12 or even 14, but continued to set the absolute minimum at seven... Traditionally across the globe, the age of consent for sexual union was a matter for family to decide or a tribal custom, in most cases this coincided with signs of puberty, menstruation for a woman, and pubic hair for a man.... In 19th century in the United States the age of consent was 10 years old, and in the state of Delaware until the 1960s it was 7 years old \" from the book \"Adolescence, Sexuality, and the Criminal Law.  Multidisciplinary Perspectives\" \nBy Vern L Bullough (American historian and sexologist)\n\nFrom the book \"A Guide to America's Sex Laws\" Book by Katharine B. Silbaugh and Richard Posner (chief judge of the United States courts of appeals). Authors say \"the law governing the age of consent has changed dramatically in the United States during the 20th century. Most states codified a statutory age of consent during the 19th century, and the usual age was 10 years\"\n\nAccording to the British Common law during the colonial period, the age of consent was 7 years old. Today we are astounded to know that girls were assumed to know about sex or about sin to make such a decision competently\n\n\"The doubt comes after the reasons for marriage at a younger age in the past have been explained and hence, the falsehood of the accusation of pedophilia made clear. They then try to make it appear that this explanation itself necessitates that Islam encourages marriages of nine year olds. This is not true at all. \nRather, as we have stated, Islām does not specify any particular age for marrriage as this is a matter that is determined by the socio-economic and environmental factors of each society or culture. Further, contemporary Muslim scholars are aware that women may have their rights violated by their parents or guardians and have spoken in this regard. A notable Islāmic scholar, Shaykh Muḥammad bin Ṣāliḥ al-ʿUthaymīn (d. 2001) spoke about unscrupulous and unjust fathers who marry off their daughters out of their desire for the wealth of suitor, to extract lots of wealth out of the suitor. In his commentary on the Ṣaḥīh al-Bukhārī, a compilation of Prophetic traditions, he explained that the marriage of ʿĀʾishah to the Prophet cannot be generalised by fathers to justify marrying their daughters early and that it is a must that a daughter only be married by her father when she reaches maturity and gives her consent. He states that any other opinion: “Will lead to corruption in this era of ours ...” and further states: \n“... And that which I consider is that from the angle of regulation and disciplinary measures in the present era is that a father should be prevented from marrying his daughter, absolutely, until she reaches maturity and is asked for her permission... And there is nothing to hinder us from preventing people from marrying off women who have not reached maturity, absolutely [without exception]...” and then the Shaykh went on to give numerous precedents from the caliph ʿUmar who \nimplemented laws to curb the excessive, unjust behaviours of people in the affair of divorce and to suspend, temporarily, the application of laws for theft in circumstances which demanded that. This shows that Muslim scholars are aware of circumstances which may demand regulation in matters that affect personal rights or that affect the welfare of people. Thus, upon what Shaykh al-ʿUthaymīn has mentioned, Muslim rulers have the capacity to implement rules in order to address evils or violation of rights, and this would include harms that come to women who are married off without their consent at an early age. Today, given the changes that have been brought to societies and nations, to their economies and social structures—and we include Muslim societies here too—it is clear that full mental maturity is reached at a delayed age—unlike times gone by—and that marriage at ages below mental maturity can bring about harm or exploitation. We also see in many Muslim countries that the age of consent for marriage are around 18 for males and slightly lower for females at around 16 to reflect these changing \ncircumstances. However, it should be made clear that the Islāmic legislation does not specify any particular age for marriage and leaves the affair to the customs and norms and habits of each society. And since most developing societies are undergoing the same changes today due to globalisation of economies and markets, access to \neducation, and mixing or merging of cultures, it is inevitable that age of marriage is going to rise in all places.\"",

Outside of the Q'uran, that is.\n\nNow, if your premise were \"if the hadiths are true, then Muhammad was a child rapist\", then I don't see a way out of agreeing with you. But if the veracity of the hadiths is disputed, as you say it is, then you can't use them to make statements of fact about Muhammad, or anything else, as if they are agreed upon by every muslim. You claim they aren't agreed upon, and therefore, the counter to your argument is built into this very premise.\n\nFinally, my christian-raised mentality would respond that being the \"most moral\" doesn't mean being perfect, because only God is perfect. In fact, in christianity prophets are anything but perfect - they're people, often deeply flawed, with whom God communicates for some reason. Their word is trusted because they were in communication with God, not because they were impeccable men who did nothing wrong. \n\nBut this is a christian take, I don't imagine a muslim would think similarly.",

That would make it an anomaly that she would have commented on. \n\nall of his other wives were complete mature adults, widows and divorcees. \n\nso if he had wanted to marry a child or was a paedophile, or was a slave to lust, why the huge discrepancy in his lifestyle and complete lack of secondary evidence? \n\nwhy this anomaly? the far more likely outcome is that she was an adult teen.\n\nto me it makes no sense to think aisha was anything other than past puberty. \n\nand yes it does mean scholars got it wrong. \n\nand nothing in islam says they can't get things wrong. \n\nIt is common for girls in their teens to have dolls, especially 1400 years ago. \n\nheck just go to comicon to see adult women with dolls. \n\nGiven all these contradictions, it is impossible to me to think she was anything other than over 15.\n\nAt worst all we can say is we don't know. \n\nBut to say she was prepubescent is illogical, given the evidence contradicting that position is greater. \n\nand the only, THE ONLY evidence that said she was younger is invalidated due to the transmitter contradicting himself. \n\nWHICH IS A BIG THING IN LAW. \n\nImagine your only witness giving contradictory evidence. \n\nIn hadith studies, that's actually considered grounds for disqualification of all that persons hadith transmissions. If he contradicts himself like that. \n\nAnd yes, you have a point Muslim scholars have had a problem with this hadith that has led to some of them being stupid and pushing the boundaries of marriage low. \n\nBut one thing I have noticed about scholars who do that, it's usually a cultural thing in those areas. \n\nthe main schools of thought which dominate sunni tradition all laid down age of marriage as being over 15.\n\nAs they emphasised the stronger hadiths, which directly dealt with prophet talking about marriage, where prophet said they had to have reached sexual maturity. \n\ninstead of this one hadith. \n\nthat is why nearly all muslims countries have age of consent set at 15 or older. \n\nLastly traditional muslims scholars usually used the age of menstruation as determing sexual maturity. \n\nOne of the massive interesting thing about menstruation (which is the usual basis for determining sexual maturity) is that before industrialisation women would regularly go into their late teens and 20s before menstruating. \n\nTHAT WAS THE NORM. \n\nThe age of menstruation was so much higher than it is today, it was 17 18 19 years before girls had their first menstruation. \n\nDue to lack of food meat, dairy, and body fat, women's bodies would delay menstruation by years. \n\nSo they would be well past todays sexual maturity before they would get their first menstrual cycle. \n\nBut modern diet high in fat, meat, dairy means girls as young as 13, 9 even 6 do get menstruation. \n\nWHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE WITH A MEDIEVAL ECONOMY DIET. \n\nthe Muslims would regularly experience mini famines. So much so, they would eat leaves and tie stones around their bellies to tighten the stomach. \n\nSo the requirement prophet laid down of menstruation actually would have meant the women of his period who did get married would have been on average much older than teens menstruating today.\n\nIn 1860 in the west the first menstruation was at 16.6 years of age.\n\nThis is 1860, where society already is experiencing much better diets. \n\nWhich is a huge difference, and makes sharia law much more sensible. \n\nSo again pushing aishas age most likely into 17, 19 area. \n\nSo yes. Muslims scholars have probably made a big mistake here i think. And they probably aren't willing to admit it.\n\n\nP. S. if anyone comes from a 3rd world country or knows people from a 3rd world country. If you ask them their age, majority of them will be unable to tell you. People in 3rd world and even more so all societies premodern 20th century never kept track of their birthdays.\n\nif you ask someone old their birthdays they will give rough statements like a year or two after the great flood or the 3 to 5 years before the bad harvest or something ridiculously vague like that.\n\nit's even such a well established reality that people joke about the ages of African sportmen. \n\nnow imagine this same problem 1400 years ago. We really don't know aishas age.\n\nwhat we do know is the 3 laws the prophet pbuh laid down, and by all accounts aishas marriage did not violate them.\n\nso on the basis of innocent until proven guilty. on the basis of the overall evidence. \n\nyou can decide. and if you don't have a biased prejudiced pre-agenda. you'll come to a different view i think.",

They were compiled long after Muhammad’s death, often conflict with one another, and even conflict with the Quran itself in places (for instance, the hadiths prescribe circumcision, which the Quran states that Allah made the human body perfectly and it should not be physically altered unnecessarily).\n\nIn recent decades, one particular theory has infuriated the Muslim world. The theory attempts to look at early Islamic history through a neutral historical lens. And, doing so, these scholars theorize that the early Arab invasions were not religious in nature, and only during the Umayyad caliphate did they begin to shape the narrative of what had occurred. One important part of legitimizing their dynasty was establishing the supremacy of Aisha, through whom they claimed descent and authority. For this reason, she was depicted as uniquely young, the only virgin Muhammad married, and his favorite wife. Despite what apologists claim, it is, in fact, very likely untrue that in this time period a marriage would even be allowed and accepted if it was so such an exceedingly young child.\n\nFurther reading:\n* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_hadith\n* https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revisionist_school_of_Islamic_studies\n\n(Sorry I can’t write out more and give more links, but I need to head out.

Same with no monogamous relationships, eating meat, and considering the way the world is going, most likely water and energy usage. In fact, I would argue that the value of a prophet is particularly focused on his ability to connect with his era (compatriots) and try to lead them towards an ideology.

            "text": "Hey, I was writing this but forgot to finish it and post it. I realize you already gave out some deltas, so I'm happy about that. I figured I might post this anyway since I bothered writing it haha.\n\nWell, the first thing that I want to point out is that it says they married when Aishah was 6 and consummated when she was 9. In Arab culture, \"marrying\" someone is generally the equivalent of the Western engagement, and \"consummating\" would be obviously intercourse but also the actual marriage with the contract. I'm sure there are differences of opinion, but mine is what I just said, that she was engaged at 6, and married at 9. So I know the engagement is a big part of this, but I'm going to mainly focus on the consummation/marriage part when she was 9 particularly because of [this](https://sunnah.com/abudawud/43/161) Hadeeth that mentions consummation.\n\nThis isn't a question of is the Prophet a child rapist if the basis of this is characterizing Aishah as a child. Then it's the question of, was Aishah a child? Why or why not?\n\nSo the first thing is, we need to find out what defines a child. Nowadays, it's legally 18. But sometimes you won't find a single difference between an 18-year-old and a 17-year-old, so there's more to it than just turning 18. One day you're 17, the next day you're 18, but humans don't just \"become\" adults overnight. To add to it, back then, turning 18 didn't mark you as an adult. So what's the actual difference between a child and an adult? How do we define a child in a time where there wasn\\\\t a set age to mark someone as a child?\n\nPuberty is generally accepted as the universal biological mark of transition from childhood to adulthood. Okay, well you wouldn't typically think of a 9-year-old to have gone through puberty and matured enough (notice how I said and matured enough because I know loads of people who begin puberty at 9, but they haven't nearly gone through it and neither are they at a certain level of maturity). So this is where biology comes in. Whether you believe in major evolution or not, minor evolution is obviously a thing, and in the past [100 years alone](https://www.livescience.com/46894-how-humans-changed-in-100-years.html), humans have evolved so much. So now think back a whole freaking 1400 years ago, it's obvious that humans were very different back then, and I'm just going to touch the tip of the iceberg. There are many aspects, but to me, the prominent ones are the (biological) physical image of a child, the (psychology) maturity, and education. Psychology kind of falls into both the biological and the educational aspects.\n\nFirst thing, lifespan has increased. Human lifespan was no doubt shorter back then, so it only makes sense that we developed at many different rates than we do now. If you use that logic, then it would make sense that people of all genders would also experience puberty at a younger age. The [average](https://tinyurl.com/ageofpuberty) age for girls to begin puberty now is 11, where for boys it's 12. Some experience it anywhere between 8-14 (or some people even earlier or later). The [average](https://tinyurl.com/endofuberty) age for girls to finish puberty is 14, and for boys, 15 or 16. I haven't found data on the puberty ages of people from so long ago, but according to religious texts and things of that sort that go way back (as I've seen a few other comments mention this), it seems like the age difference between a parent and their child or a grandmother and their grandchild was hardly much, and it would only make sense that they had kids at a young age. Obviously, you can't have a kid until you begin puberty, and so we can conclude that if those sources are accurate, then people experience puberty way earlier than they do now. And this adds up to the fact that lifespans were shorter, so people developed differently than they do now.\n\nRemember how I said I'll be focusing on when Aishah got married at 9? Yeah, so in [the last Hadeeth](https://sunnah.com/abudawud/43/161) that I linked, Abu Dawood interpreted what she said to be an indirect way of saying that she menstruated. But since that was Abu Dawood's interpretation, let's use [this](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/8/124) hadeeth and a bit of logic, she clearly mentions puberty. Prior to her consummation, she lived with her parents, and in this Hadeeth, she obviously lived with her parents but she's already pubescent. So if after she consummated the marriage, she no longer lived with her parents, then it's safe to say she went through puberty before the occurrence of the evens in this Hadeeth, and she got married after the occurrence events of this Hadeeth, therefore resulting in that got married post-puberty. So now we got the biological point down, she did experience puberty.",

            "text": "This is a very difficult topic to talk about, because the history and Hadith authenticity is all over the place. \n\nSince when are Ahadiths narrated by a person themselves considered \"authentic\"? Usually you would read something like Person A heard person B say \"...\" Or person A narrates that the Prophet ... - There are no Ahadith directly from the prophet.\n\nHow come that most Ahadith saying Aisha is 6 or 9 are mostly narrated by herself? Shouldn't there be other people who can testify her age, especially since she is such a prominent figure. \n\nFrom a Muslim's perspective the narrations of Aisha about herself are trustworthy. But if you look at it objectively: Aisha could have lied. So the logical thing to do would be look at what a third party source or neutral source that gives information about her age. Or we can compare Aisha to other people's ages. \n\nIn your Edit: You gave a source to one specific narration where the backstory is that Aisha was accused of adultery and people defend her by saying \"she's too young and simpleminded to do that\". No specific age given. - this doesn't help. This can be a 20 year old women too.  Also this story is a bit weird. Usama bin Zayd was 13 years old when that story happened. Why would the prophet ask a 13 year old boy whether his wife was cheating?\n\nOne narration is by \"Hisham's father\" who I assume is Urwah ibn Zubayr, Aishas nephew who was born 20-30 yeears after the prophets death. So he didn't witness any wedding and his testimony is unreliable.\n\nGeerally speaking. Any account of her age is unreliable. She could be of any age and no narration can prove it. \n\nTo cite user RelaxedOrange: One important part of legitimizing their (Ummayad) dynasty was establishing the supremacy of Aisha, through whom they claimed descent and authority. For this reason, she was depicted as uniquely young, the only virgin Muhammad married, and his favorite wife. \n\nThis legitimacy was later disputed by the Abbasid empire. The Abbasid's started a hate campaign on Aisha. For example amplify Ahadith that make Aisha look bad. This is where all the historical distortion is probably coming from",

            "text": "\\>  By following the logic that the hadiths can't be trusted then we would have little to no knowledge of Muhammad himself and also getting rid of the hadiths turns the Quran into mound of disconnected contextless writings.\n\nWell, we do have little knowledge of Muhammed. His life and writings are narrated, but whether they are in oral tradition or even in the Quran, we are still talking about stories from well over a thousand years ago. So, we must look at what sources we have, how early they are, and if they corroborate each-other. We can neither blanket throw out, nor blanket accept either option.\n\nThe Hadiths are oral traditions, gathered in writing in the 8th and 9th centuries. Rather conveniently for us, that would put them around the same time as later Christian texts, such as, for example, the Sayings Gospel of Thomas. They were oral traditions, and then they became written.\n\nSo, what we know would be that if we had a Hadith allegedy from Aisha, we know that someone in the 700s-800s thought that Aisha said it. Whether Aisha ACTUALLY said it is another issue entirely. If they widely attest to her existence, and to her saying something similar, we might presume she existed and that, even if she didn't say it, they could reflect somehting reasonable to think she said.\n\nSo, for example, we can say that we know that around 846, someone wrote down that Aisha was married at 6 and the marriage was consummated at 9. And you provide many similar quotes to back that up. That does sound good, but the problem is that they all seem to back up similar things. A couple times, such as in Mishkat al-Masabih, you're talking about something that explicitly sets out TO collect previous writings. So that's not necessarily NEW evidence, that's an expansion of a collection of two previous things that you've already cited. We know why that person thought it, because we know earlier people thought it.\n\nIt's somewhat problematic for us to use the Hadiths because of how much time passed, for the same reason it's hard to use something like the Gospel of Thomas. Did Jesus REALLY say he was going to turn Mary into a man because women don't have souls? Well, maybe, maybe not... But we know nobody thought he did until then.\n\nWhen you cite the Hadiths, you're citing a person 200 years later claiming that it had been said. Well, that may mean it was said, that may not. After all, when I was in highschool and middle school, we used to play a game where we'd all sit in a circle. One person would whisper a short story to another. That person would whisper the story to another, who would whisper it to another, who would whisper it to another. Then the last person, sitting at the left of the one who started it, would tell the story they heard. Remarkably, that story would almost universally bare relatively little resemblance to the original tale.\n\nAnd that, of course, was a story told over a few minutes by people of similar ages, cultures, and socioeconomic statuses. With Hadiths, we have the problem of them travelling through well over a century, across all manner of people. People who were, sadly, far more interested in making the subject of the story look good, or bad, or what have you, than we were when playing our party game, which meant they were more likely to change.\n\nYou seem to be presenting a rather bizarre binary view. That either we think that the Hadiths are reliable, and that what they relate is necessarily true, or we throw everything out and render everything nonsense. But neither, I think, is quite accurate. What I think we can safely say would be \"Muhammed was believed, 200 years after his life, by his followers, to have had sex with a 9-year-old girl.\"\n\nBut WHY they believed that can be different things. We are all pretty sure that Aisha was his youngest wife, however young she was. And we know she was one of his most fervent followers. And we know that her father became Caliph after Muhammed, and that she participated on the Sunni side of a battle between Sunni and Shiite armies.\n\nThat makes her a very touchy figure when it comes to stories about their relationships. One side (Sunnis) would naturally want her to seem closer than she actually was, while another side (Shiites) would want her to seem less close to him than she actually was. It makes us hard to take any claims about their relationship seriously. After all, the Hadiths aren't actual things the people said, they're what someone said that they said, well over a century later. There was undoubtedly a strong oral tradition that he got married to her at age 6 in the 8th and 9th centuries.\n\nI mean, think about it. People in the 21st century are often falsely believed to have made some statement or another. And we can often check. I can check to see if the quotes that are attributed to various politicians are real, and yet, we often get them misunderstood or just outright made up. When we are talking about contemporaneous accounts of people whose words were recorded at the time, that is, what did (various politician) say on the floor of the Senate, we often get stuff made up. Why on earth would we assume that a widely believed claim 150 years later is going to be true?\n\nWe have some claims that she was 6. But scholars who think she was 19 aren't pulling stuff out of their asses. They also base it on accounts, including Hadiths, which portray her acting very much like a fully mature young woman shortly after marriage.\n\nAnd let's be clear, it's not like there are just some Hadiths which say she acted smart, and but her having sex at 9 is BETTER attested than her spending 9 years being a genius while married to him. There are more stories about her talking and acting like an adult than there are about her talking and acting like a child.\n\nThat does not, of course, mean she was not a child. It just means that her being a child would require more Hadiths to be false than her being a child would. All that means is that by the time the Hadiths were written, there was a better oral tradition of that.\n\nAnd of course, because this is Aisha we're talking about, one of the more controversial figures at the time, that means that she is unusually susceptible to lies being told about her. If we accept that at the time, sex with a 9-year-old would be permissible, we could also assume that a person would make up a story where Muhammed has sex with her at age 9 to boost her prestige. I mean, we have people making false claims about things said by people like Barack Obama. A shocking number of people genuinely believe that Sarah Palin said \"I can see Russia from my house\" in a Vice-Presidential debate. And that's a claim that you can actually just watch video and check. But what videos could an 8th-century Muslim watch showing Aisha and Muhammed's personal life?\n\nSome Hadiths are false. It is possible all Hadiths are false. It is not possible all Hadiths are true. There was a definite oral tradition which claimed she had sex with him at the age of 9. Whether that is true or not is impossible to say, because we are relying on a by-that-time century-old oral tradition. We can be certain that that amount of time after the death of, say, Simon Peter, he was being quoted as saying all manner of things it seems impossible for him to have said. Why would Aisha not be subject to the same thing?\n\n\\-c-",

This is what I have reached which Changed My View on this topic.\n\nIn Islam (and possibly other religions), a human is considered an Adult responsible for their actions and sins and accountable for them once the human reaches puberty.\n\nIslam (and possibly other religions) does not define a specific age \"in digits\" for any man or woman for marriage and/or pregnancy. The religion has left the age out of it and limited it to being an Adult. The age of marriage is left unset, but the religion has set the minimal \"age\" to \"reaching puberty\"; leaving the actual age \"in digits\" open for social, customs and standards in the time period which it is being applied.\n\nBased on reading your responses to the comments, you seem to be more focused on the \"a religious figure should not be the one doing so even if it was a normal practice in that society in that time period\", so I will focus my response based on that.\n\nThe Prophet is not doing anything to please the majority of a certain time; should the age been 16, 18, 21, 25,..etc??. His actions were not about a specific age. He obeys the word of God and applies the religion as it is set. So the Prophet was doing something that obey the religion limits \"Puberty\" being minimal \"age\", and at a \"digits\" age which during that time was permissible and not viewed as \"rape\" as we might be seeing it in current society. \n\nWith that view, we should not be looking for why he didn't do it according to our current standard. Instead I am seeing that he did what was permissible and acceptable at the time by the religion and society.\n\nLook at the society of that era. Early teens were not considered children. There was no high schools and universities that go into the 20s of digit age. In that society, reaching puberty \"women getting periods and boobs\" and \"men getting a wet dream and some hair above their lip\" was considered a grown person that worked, went to war, looked for food, got married, had children and took responsibilities of families (both men and women).\n\nIf he had only married someone over 18, we would probably be having the same conversation in 50 years when our society evolves to view marriage age as nothing less than 25; same as the people before us \"maybe -100 years\" used to view being married at 16 was normal.\n\nAs for the religion that the Prophet represents, Islam has set the minimal \"age\" to \"reaching puberty\"; leaving the actual age \"in digits\" open for social, customs and standards in the time period which it is being applied\n\n \n\nThis is how I viewed it and reached the conclusion that Changed My View on this topic.",

The two other books are Sahih Muslim and Al-muwatta written by Malik Ibn Anas, born between 706 and 716 and died in 796.  \n\nBecause the books weren't from the prophet's living time or soon after his death, you can assume they aren't all true. Especially that they weren't brought by God either but humans. \n\nAksow Al-Bukhari said himself he collected 600 000 hadiths in total before deciding that 593 000 were false. Meaning, if he started collecting them at age 10 until the day he died, and did so everyday, he would have collected and verified an average of 33 hadith a day :\n50 × 365 = 18 250\n600 000 ÷ 18 250 ≈ 32.87\nThat seems quite a lot if I'm being honest but if you choose to believe he actually did so, you do you.\n\nNow, if I remember well, the first and last sayings you quoted were brought back by a single person who gave only those two hadiths. They weren't quoted by anyone else and they didn't quote any other hadiths. And i remember having read somewhere that this person had a different with the prophet (this section has to be verified as I didn't check sources at the time and it's all based on my memory, i might be wrong)\n\nAnyways, those books aren't followed by all muslims because not everybody considers them legit as once again they were written long after the prophet's death and therefore, you can't verify his sayings nor those of the people who lived at his time. So Aisha may have been 6, or 9, or 19, or between 21 and 24 (a study had been done comparing the dates of possible birth and showed she would have been somewhere between those ages), but we can't be certain, because Aisha wasn't there to write herself what she possibly said in those books",

            "text": "Old Testament of the bible says if a man rapes a women he must \"buy\" her, paying her father in silver and marrying her in some sort of lifelong forced monogamy punishment that completely overlooks the women. Christians are quick to point out those were Jewish laws for society to function and Christ's sacrifice turned them from *requirements* to some kind of *guideline* to understand history and morality. And progressives complain about it.\n\nThe Quran says Muhammad was attracted to six year old and he had sex with her when she was nine and well before puberty living some sort of pedophilia fantasy life that some could only sexually fantasize about. Islamists are quick to point out those Hadiths don't count due to conflicting stories that may or may not suggest she was older and it also doesn't really matter because it's not a guideline of *your* morality but an autobiography of man living in a *different culture*. And progressives jump to defend it.\n\nIt's a shining example of bias, and I suggest reading up on [Presentism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentism_(literary_and_historical_analysis))\n> In literary and historical analysis, presentism is the anachronistic introduction of present-day ideas and perspectives into depictions or interpretations of the past. Some modern historians seek to avoid presentism in their work because they consider it a form of cultural bias, and believe it creates a distorted understanding of their subject matter. The practice of presentism is regarded by some as a common fallacy when writing about the past. ... Presentism is also a factor in the problematic question of history and moral judgments. Among historians, the orthodox view may be that reading modern notions of morality into the past is to commit the error of presentism. ... Some religious historians argue that morality is timeless, having been established by God; they say it is not anachronistic to apply timeless standards to the past. (In this view, while mores may change, morality does not.)\n\nAnd let's branch off that last bit there. The argument that morality is static but mores can change. Both religions attempt this, Christianity separates it's self into the Old and New testament while the Quran sort of borrows the Old testament and Torah but then updates them with Sharia Law. Christianity has a singular Pope to further modernize concepts while any self-proclaimed Islamist can essentially issue a Fatwa. These examples suggest there is an element that can change.\n\nAnd that is how you get into the real religious debates. Is pedophilia morally wrong, or in an age where it's 1/3 your life span and just 1~3 years short of a traditional starting point of a new family somehow less serious? Perhaps the morality is the willingness after a three year waiting period. Maybe the sex has nothing to do with morality, rather the message is that Aisha had extensive history with him and those quotes as just the early days of a longer narrative that extends into her being a war general.\n\nI apologise this is a less than direct opposition to your view point. But the question of what is morality and what is not is a driving force in religious texts and you've only just begun to start learning them. A good Bible Study group in Christianity actually discusses the subjective elements in hope of better understanding it, and I imagine many Islamists due the same. For all we know, given how much the Shia hate Aisha, the \"moral\" of the story is pedophilia raises terrible people that'll later poison you.",

            "text": "There is a single origin for the Hadith claiming Aisha was six or nine, originating from Ibn Hisham, a friend of the prophet.  in his later years, ibn hisham was said to be going senile, and his writings from this time were ignored by his students, and his student’s students until all Hadith were compiled a century  later. This Hadith was not considered valid until the 1800s with the rise of the salafi movement, a movement which  considers Hadith infallible and as important as the Quran. \n\nHadith were passed down orally for 200 years after the prophet died before being compiled and standardized. Hadith were simply stories of the prophet and his interactions with individuals and small groups of people.  When Hadith were compiled, the scholars who compiled it said they included all of them, just to be safe, even if they contradicted each other or seemed questionable.  The Quran, on the otherhand, was standardized 10 years after the prophet died, and Quranic verses were recited to the entire Muslim community at mosques and Friday prayers, and were often repeated. The reason I bring this up is to show you the flaws in the historiography of Hadith. Half of all collected Hadith were found to contradict the Quran, and are considered fabricated. Other Hadith have their chains of transmission graded as strong or weak. A strong Hadith doesn’t mean it’s true, it just means the oral transmission seemed to have no known liars passing it down. Several strong Hadith contradict each other. Even harmless ones. \n\nNow with that out of the way, the Hadith in question, about Aisha being 6 or 9 at the time of marriage is contradicted by several other Hadith and secular historical facts. Things like how the battle of badr started 1 year after the prophet and Aisha married, and Muhammad forbid anyone under 15 from going to the battle. Aisha was at that battle supporting the soldiers.  \n\nAnother being Aisha’s sister was 30 at the time their wedding, and Aisha was said to be about 10 years younger than her sister. \n\nThe biggest contradictions to the claim Aisha was 6 or 9 a was that Arab nobility (which Aisha was) did not get married until the individual getting married could Understand their own finances. Muhammad established this practice for all Muslims, (along with puberty). A 6 or 9 year old has no ability to understand finances, and this wouldn’t have been allowed in Islam, or even under the culture of pre Islamic nobility. Also, before the modern era, people reached puberty later. It would’ve been very uncommon for Aisha to have reached puberty at 9. \n\nThe Arabs at the time did not have a standard calendar, so ages were estimated until the Muslims standardized time keeping during Muhammad’s time in Medina, which was years sheet Aisha and Muhammad married. \n\nA side note, Muhammad first and favorite wife was Khadijah, Who was 40 when she wed Muhammad, who was 25 at the time. All of Muhammad’s 11 other wives were middle aged widows or divorcees. Muhammad married Aisha as a political alliance with abu bakr. \n\nLastly, in the old world, it wasn’t common for women to be married young because pregnancy would literally kill them if they weren’t old enough. Women were a very important resource in a healthy society, and keeping them alive was important because women are the only people who can give birth. Until the modern age, it was common for women to outnumber men, because men had to do all the risky stuff. Because a single man can impregnate multiple women, but women can only give birth to a single child a year. Aisha, bring nobility, would never be allowed to risk her life being pregnant young. \n\nSecular historians estimate Aisha to be 16-19 at the time of marriage. Only ibn hishams original Hadith claims otherwise.",

            "text": "What really stands out to me is that despite multiple people explaining that there are issues with the Hadith you keep copy-pasting, you just go on with the exact same Hadith. I have read multiple replies and have seen a lot of very well written and logical arguments, and even though you read them and replied to them, the next comment you copy-paste the exact same ‘sources’. There is also a verse from the Quran you keep referring to and a lot of people have explained very profoundly that that particular verse is about menopause or women who don’t get periods for any other reason. Yet you keep using it as if it backs your statements. I’m having a hard time believing it’s possible to change your view about this. \nAnyway, I didn’t read everything of course, but I’d like to add some things, on top of the arguments others have made about the illogicality of it all. \n\nMohammed pbuh had many wives and none of them were younger or of an inappropriate age, even for modern standards. His first wive was even way older than he was. If he really was a pedophile and if it really was considered normal, he would have chosen more younger girls to be married to, right? As a Muslim, he would have to wait until a girl hits puberty and starts menstruating. He would never have broken that rule. \n\nAs a Muslim I did learn she was younger (but we don’t know how old exactly) than his previous wives and there is an explanation for that. The reason his last wife was a younger woman, was so she could recall and report on his ways and statements. She is a very important part of the Sunnah. Her memory was strong and she could narrate a lot of significant stories that would help Muslims in the future with practicing their faith. Of course there are flaws within that thinking, because no memory is perfect. But we can assume a young and intelligent woman would be more capable of remembering things correctly than for example his first wife. And there’s the bigger chance she would live longer and have more time to narrate everything that needed to be passed on. So the marriage wasn’t just an older man marrying a young woman because that’s what he liked. It was a strategy to spread the Sunnah. This would also make it extremely illogical that she was 6 at the time of marrying him, because that would defeat the entire purpose (her being able to spread the word about his life and statements). So that’s another reason to dismiss that one unreliable source that states she was six-nine. \n\nIt is of course still possible that she was anywhere between 12-15 because puberty could hit at that age and for me in this day and age I’d consider it very inappropriate. With our modern standards and the way children are brought up these days there is NO excuse to feel lust and sexual feelings for a young teenager. I find it disgusting. BUT we are talking about a period of time over 1500 years ago. In that time and place, it was normal for families to bury their daughters alive, just because they weren’t men. Not to mention the ‘normal’ practice of very very young prostitutes. It was the prophet pbuh and his message that gave women rights such as the rule of not marrying without consent or hitting puberty. That’s called progress. Why would someone who implemented those rules, break them himself? Especially after being married to many women of all sorts and ages, but none of them being particularly young. We can conclude that he was really not just another pervert who liked young women, despite the fact that in his culture and time it was extremely common to do so. \n\nIn regard to her actual age: I don’t think we will ever figure it out. Logic states that it’s not possible she would still be a literal child, but we can’t know if she was 13 or 20 at the time. My mother is in her 50’s and from a rural part in Morocco. Her age and date of birth are also a little ambiguous. We know her date of birth is incorrect and that’s because it wasn’t that big of a deal where she’s from. And I’m talking about someone who is born in the 60’s, let alone 1500 years ago. \n\nI think the most important conclusion is that there is no way she wouldn’t have hit puberty before they got married. 6 is therefore not even a possibility. \n\nAndddd I’d like to thank people who toke the time to reply to you with respect and well written arguments, I have learned a lot.",

FYI if you go by that then every one up to the 1700s was a rapist. the pioneers used to marry teenager to 40 yr old men. And as some one mentioned before morality is subjective  to time and place. So as of the times he may have been very moral compared to the heathens around him. at least he didnt sacrifice his children to Baal!",

Our laws say sex with anyone under 18 is rape.

One may be more plausible than the others, but the quality of the evidence is the same—-and it is a bad practice to form and hold strong opinions based on poor quality evidence. My understanding of the Mohammed child marrriage was that this was a formality with legal meaning in uniting disparate tribes/power bases not a romantic or carnal event.

No-one can surpass him... except we all have. If he sprang back to life tomorrow nobody would assume he was a messenger of God - he'd be an illiterate paedophile diagnosed with severe mental illness. \n\nBut given that he is supposedly the greatest man who ever lived, people seek to emulate his life. To this day people in the Arab world drink camel piss because it is said Muhammad liked to do that.\n\nApologists invariably flock in and make excuses, such as the one oft used here; that he was enlightened and progressive *for his time*. Except he wasn't. Muhammad preached that women were essentially chattel, suitable only for fucking and housework. The divinely inspired Sharia law he supposedly gave to us codifies the idea that a woman's testimony is worth half of a man's, and that said testimony is entirely worthless unless at least one man can back the women up. Meanwhile, in the civilised world, the Anglo Saxons believed that women could run their own businesses, could make and settle commercial contracts without a man's involvement, and were entitled to the same personhood under the law as men. While Islam proudly proclaims Muhammad married a six year old and raped her at age nine, the Anglo Saxon world held the view that consummation of marriage should wait until the bride has at least grown some pubic hair, and even then it seems marriage was typically taking place between people in their late teens and early twenties.\n\nSo we can throw out the utterly false notion that Muhammad was anything but backward even by the standards of his own time period. Perhaps not his native culture, but certainly by the standards of what would become my own country. This is not what I would expect of a messianic 'perfect man'.\n\nThis veneration of an utterly twisted and evil individual as the apex of mankind is in no small part a source of fundamentalism, and it is why I despise Islam and its apologists. The likes of ISIS or Boko Haram are not some fringe extremists corrupting an otherwise virtuous faith; in their beliefs, attitudes and behaviours they are in fact much closer to Muhammad than the vast majority of Muslims. The things they do are inkeeping with what Muhammad did - from the butchering of non-believers to the enslavement of women.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow before someone accuses me of being an Islamophobe who is only picking on the Religion of Peace because I have an irrational hatred of good boys who never flew planes into anything, I will point out this problem exists in all religions. There are Jews in Israel who adhere to religiously inspired laws based upon the laws of the Torah, and I condemn these people just as fervently. There are fundamentalist Christians who take inspiration from the Bible's most vitriolic passages, and I condemn them as well. However, the Jews are still waiting for their messiah to deliver the one true will of God, and for all the contradictions of the New Testament Jesus begged God to forgive his killers, not avenge his death.\n\nIslam is unique in that it is a militant faith. As someone one put it, if your goal was to create a religion that could unify people under your war banner and justify the conquest of your rivals, you couldn't do much better than Islam. It is a uniquely evil religion, and we as a society need to stop pretending that Islam is simply \"Christianity for brown people\". We abandoned notions of Christendom - Islam did not abandon the Caliphate.",

(I hope that this is not taken as an attack against the Jewish faith or people, I'm merely discussing history)\n* Sahih Bukhari and others are the life work of great men who dedicated their life to try to purify the hadiths from the wrong things that was put there, Sahih in Arabic can be translated into true and Bukhari is the name of the author.\n* because these books were written long after the prophet's death (more than 150 years), the way that they relied on to judge the hadith was mainly 2 things :\n   * Does it conflict with the Quran teachings?\n   * The history and reputation of the narrators, for example if a hadith has been told through multiple people and one of them was known as a liar then that hadith was dropped and judged as weak or corrupt and recorded in the books as such.\n* Those great men were human who were trying to do their best, so, these books contain mistakes and for such reason you will find different books with some differences between them and until our day and age people with the knowledge have been purifying them. \n\nNow to the point.\n\n* There are Haidth that say Aisha was 6 / 9 and there are others that say differently 13-17.\n* Aisha was engaged to another person before breaking the engagement and getting engaged to the prophet, so, it was either a common thing to marry 6 years old (It was not) or she was old enough to get married.\n* The enemies of the prophet called him everything but never did anyone call him that and try to shame him as someone who married a child. \n* Islam dictates that for a woman to get married she has to:\n   * Reach puberty\n   * agrees to the marriage without anyone forcing her\n   * her guardian / parent agrees to the marriage (if it is her first time)\n\nIf any of the above is not true the marriage is considered void.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Why just one? out of all his wives she was the only one who was claimed to be that young? if that was his thing wouldn't there have been more for someone so powerful and influential at his time?\n* There are a lot calculations to determine the exact age of Aisha based on the known age of her sister Asmaa and the difference between them, you can find online if you're interested.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nas for \n\n> By following the logic that the hadiths can't be trusted  then we would  have little to no knowledge of Muhammad himself and also getting rid of  the hadiths turns the Quran into mound of disconnected contextless  writings.  \n\nIf a Hadith conflicts with the Quran teachings , yes it can't be trusted, the Quran is the holy book of Islam, you don't need to read anything else to understand it and get the message that was intended for you to receive it. yes some hadith discuss some explanations about some stories that were not detailed in the Quran but that doesn't really change the message, you will get it whether you know the details or not. \n\nI encourage you to try to read the Quran from a point of view of understanding the message that is being sent.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthank you for reading this, I hope that I added something useful to the discussion and I hope that I may have helped you change your point of view.",

            "text": "I believe the flaw in your view is that you’re linking your standards to an age when you should be linking your standards to what the age represents.\n\nIn Islam, there are standards that must be met before a marriage can be consummated (or be considered halal/legal). Some of them are: \n- he/she must have hit puberty (hard to tell in men but for women it is 30 days after her first mensuration)\n- he/she must be mentally ready/mentally matured\n- he/she must agree to the marriage\n- Her guardian (if available) must agree\n- And there are others I can’t recall.\n\nIf you look at these standards without associating an age or gender to it, I think these standards seem fair and logical. All of them are objective except for the 2nd one. In order to make it easier to answer \"Is someone mentally matured or not?\", society takes the average age of when boys/girls are typically mature.\n\nNow, the age that fit the standard 1600 ago was 9+ (actually- less than 150 years ago Delaware (US) had an age of consent at 7).\n\nThe age that fits those standards today, in the western world, is probably 16-25. I say in the western world because if you visit any 3rd world country, you’ll see how sharp some of these young kids are when they’re tossed in the real world rather than in front of cartoons and video games.\n\nIt is very possible that age is even higher 100 years from now.\n\nMy point being, Muhammad's marriage to Aaisha fits the standard (I'll cite my sources if you like)\n- Aaisha had hit puberty\n- She was mentally ready (she was actually engaged to another man prior to Muhammad, but the groom’s family called it off as they didn’t want to be associated with anyone who was associated with Muhammad)\n- She agreed to it\n- Her father agreed to it\n- The marriage was not consummated until 30 days after she had menstruated\n\nSince the age of mental maturity varies from person to person, society to society, time to time; the number is not as relevant as what the number represents.\n\nNow if your view is the standards are wrong- then that’s a different topic for a different discussion.\n\nI hope this helps.",

Allah proposed this marriage because Allah wanted someone young by prophet (s) side all the time so that she could record everything prophet (s) did 24/7. \n\nProphet Muhammad (s) was a slave of Allah and he did what Allah told him to do. It's not like he liked her before marriage or anything. Allah told him to get married, thus he did. \n\nMaybe you don't believe in divine order or Allah, but we do. So please refrain from calling someone a \"child rapist\" without even knowing the context. Freedom of speech doesn't mean that you should attack someone without understanding why someone did what they did. For example, Allah allowed prophet (s) to marry 13 women, but Allah didn't allow all men to do so. It was an exception for Prophet (s). because it was for a divine reason. Not for personal satisfaction or anything sexual!  Everything Muhammad (s) did, he did it because Allah told him to. He never questioned Allah. Did you know during the war of Badr, Muslims only had 300 soldiers, while their opponents had 3000 soldiers? They could have thought that they were going to die because the scenario itself was so brutal. Still, they went, because Allah told them to, and guess what, they won the war. This is what makes religious people different from non-religious people. We are ready to sacrifice our lives if our faith and Allah tell us to do so. Because we believe there is a greater good in it. For us, this world is an exam hall. There are rules, and we need to abide by them to pass the exam. If we pass the exam, we will get heaven and we will be able to do whatever we want in our afterlife if we can please Allah.  So please before questioning something, know the context.

To learn more about the structure of the QUR'AN , look for the information on the Coherence in Quran.\n\n  \nand Prophet Muhammad(PBUH) did not founded Islam rather he was the last prophet of the Abrahamic monotheistic religion. The Quran describes the events of lives of Prophets such as Musa (Alhai Salam) and Isa (Alahi Salam) among many others. The Hajj, Salah and Fasting predates Islam.   \n\n\nFor the Coherence, you could ask for any single Sura and I can provide the central theme being discussed and how it relates to the rest of the QUR'AN.  \n\n\nAll the Best",

It is stated that her parents were companions of The Prophet before “The Call” and that her father had already promised her to another man previously. This may have happened when she was six.\nAfter she was betrothed it was five years before she was married, this is evidenced where it explains she was betrothed two years before the hijra to Medina, which took three years and she was married the year after the hijra took place.\nAisha is said to have died at the age of 66 years old at 58 AH, this means at the time of the call she was eight years old. If she was only engaged after the call (even by a year) she must have been nine and as her marriage was three years later she would have been a minimum of 12.\nHowever, Aisha’s sister Asma is stated to have been ten years older than Aisha and is listed as being 28 years old in the first year of the call. This makes Aisha 18 years old at the time and then 19 at time of marriage.\n\nClearly these two factors contradict each other, added to the problem is that the Hadith were traditionally passed on verbally and as stated Aisha’s age (unlike legal hadith) was not really a matter for discussion.\nAisha was reported to have taken part in battles alongside The Prophet, riding a camel providing water for others. Muhammand prohibited children from fighting and taking part in battles in any way, meaning she must have been reckoned as an adult.\nFinally, The Prophet forbid marriages to take place unless both parties independently agreed as adults to it. As a nine year old, Aisha would not have been considered an adult and as a result could not have given permission for the marriage. Fathers are not allowed to force children to marry under the Prophet’s decrees",
