    "CMV: female dating strategy is little more than a sub for hating on and devaluing men\nI lurked on there to see if there was any solid advice, but 80% of the posts I see are just people complaining about men. I got out of a several-years-long relationship on good terms a while ago and visited the sub to maybe find some tips on getting back out into the dating world. I totally get venting about a date gone wrong, or posting about not meeting someone who fits their standards, but how are people expecting to find a relationship with such a consistent negative mindset? \n\nLike many who post there, I also personally aim for having a partner that is socioeconomically equal to or higher than me, I work hard, have a good education, and can hold my own, I need a partner who can do the same for themselves. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they work construction or if they‚Äôre a professional streamer or what have you, I just aim for people who are doing /something/. The ridiculous standards on FDS are a little wack. Being told I /deserve/ someone with 6 figures when I myself only land in the 40k range is a bit of a reach. All in all, if the person I‚Äôm talking to doesn‚Äôt have ambitions or a sort of life plan, I kindly move on and have even remained good friends with a couple of guys I once casually dated. \n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm off topic. \n\nThe downfall of the sub is they‚Äôre consistently crapping on dudes who they deem ‚Äòbelow them‚Äô for myriad reasons that don‚Äôt make much sense. If it‚Äôs not a good fit, move on, that‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs future spouse, so don‚Äôt stress about it. They tout themselves as having high standards, when in reality many posters just want someone to be ‚Äòchivalrous‚Äô and pay their way. A key to a good relationship is when both partners feel as though they have the better deal. Have I not lurked enough to come across decent posts? Should I post my own opinions there and risk getting dragged?": [

As an admittedly female sub, this will of course involve some shitting on men, but that's not my larger point.\n\nLike a lot of relationship commentary, and especially that aimed at people focused on breakups, there is a lot of talk of who is owed what in a relationship. This is the kind of sub that will naturally be sought out by women like yourself who have recently been reintroduced to the dating scene, whether by choice or force and whether fairly or unfairly.\n\nAfter a relationship ends, it's a fairly normal reaction for someone to try to convince his or herself that he or she was the good guy and that it wasn't his or her fault. Online fora catering to people who recently have broken up will therefore populate mostly with those in that mindset.\n\nSome people, like you, will look at it and say that they don't want to focus on that negativity or break down every relationship they see in the media as some microcosm of the higher platonic form of 'relationship'. Some others, though, will look at it and dive in. That sub seems to be mostly people who have dove in.\n\nThat all said, trees do grow from dirt and others have pointed out that the sub does have some good advice. I think that advice, as well as the overall sub, is not limited to just women, and so that is likely the shortcoming of the sub (which is most likely because the mods of such a sub are those who dive into breaking down relationships the most).\n\nI mean, \"don't date a loser\" is fairly universal advice that anyone would agree to in abstract, but that for some is hard to stick to in practice. The kind of people consistently going to these subs are going down a rabbit hole of overanalyzing relationships and drawing some wrong conclusions because of that. They may sometimes shit on men, but they also have some good advice. And that's a hell of a lot more than I can say about my ex wife :)",

They really don't see dating as a path to a relationship. They don't want a relationship. They want to trade what little they have to offer (largely sex and looks) for power and money that comes from being associated with a man who has high social status and good income. \n\nWhat's funny is that the people I know who have those things (and I include myself in that) really are turned off by the sort of people who value those things above people. \n\nI am a high earner. I am likely \"desirable\" by FDS standards. I'm in my early 50's, I'm very well off, I have more than enough money to retire comfortably whenever I want, I am a well-respected expert in my field, I have a PhD, I'm in a leadership position in a public company, etc.\n\nMy idea of a great first date would absolutely get me kicked to the curb by FDS -- thankfully! I want to go to the park by the lake, walk along the path and talk. We can stop at the stand and pick up a coke and a dog and munch on that if we get hungry, and we can just have fun getting to know each other. I don't want to go drop $400 on a fancy dinner to see if we like each other, I want to find out who the person is without pretense. \n\nAnd my second, third, fourth, eighteenth dates would likely get me thrown away too -- because I like to do simple, easy, everyday things: go for walks, play with my dog at the beach, hit up a museum, etc. \n\nI am no interested in being a stuffed shirt showing off for other people. I have to do that to earn my paycheck, I sure as hell don't want to relax that way. And any woman who wants a relationship with me would understand that!\n\nAnd, I know I'm not alone. Most guys (and gals too!) who have high profile, good paying jobs don't want to have to show off on days off. Putting on a performance for others is hard work. Relaxing and being accepted for who one is, now that's what can be the start of a great relationship though!\n\nBut FDS doesn't want that. They want someone they can show off and use. \n\nSo, I don't think it is that they hate men. I think you have that wrong. Rather, they just don't see men as part of the equation. They aren't thinking in terms of a relationship where there are two people in a partnership and each is getting something of equal worth and value. They are thinking totally in terms of what they get. And that's all they are interested in.",

I'd ever bet the majority of men who are actually looking for a long term relationship are also open to a quick hookup. So women, who tend to be more selective anyway, can have an overwhelming number of potential matches to sort through. Sites like Tinder that only show you people who like you if you like them make this problem even worse because a lot of men k know on Tinder literally swipe right on ever woman so they don't miss a potential match.

Of all women, only women that use reddit, and of all women that use reddit, only women that:\n\n* Are struggling to find and hold down a relationship; i.e., are not having success dating.\n\n* Are the kind of people that seek dating advice on reddit.\n\n* Are likely to also use /r/datingoverthirty, /r/datingoverforty, and /r/AskWomenOver30 according to [subredditstats](https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps/femaledatingstrategy).\n\n* Are most likely to also use /r/PurplePillDebate according to [subredditstats](https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps/femaledatingstrategy). PurplePillDebate is a subreddit for debating with \"RedPill\" people (see /r/TheRedPill (or don't - it's super toxic), which is a segment of the [manosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manosphere).\n\nGiven this, I would speculate that it is reasonable to characterize the subreddit's demography as women, aged 30+, lonely, and terminally online. In other words, this is a particularly vulnerable and desperate population, which is ripe for preying upon.\n\n#####Radicalization and $$$\n\nWhen you have a population that is relatively vulnerable and isolated, then inundating them in information, ideas, and ideology that lacks broader appeal will server to further isolate that population by pushing away the people around them, leading to them relying more and more on their radicalizing community as a place of support and socialization. This process then repeats itself and becomes difficult to break free from. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy whereby the FDS population adopts toxic ideas about love, sex, and relationships, and in doing so works against themselves in their search for love, sex, and relationships.\n\nNow, this is where things get spicy. The moderators of FDS have a captive audience in the FDS users because the FDS advice is far more likely to harm than help their dating prospects. So, what do you do with a captive audience? Well, you turn them into customers! The FDS mods have created a corporation, \"The Real Female Dating Strategy LLC\", which has a website, podcast, and social media presence across basically all platforms, all of which can be found in [the FDS Sub wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStrategy/wiki/index). In addition to any sort of ad revenue, site traffic, or sponsorship they have, they also have [merchandising](https://www.thefemaledatingstrategy.com/fds-merchandise-1).\n\n#####Summary\n\nSo to your claim that FDS is *merely* for hating men, I present to you the case that actually FDS is for radicalizing women and then taking advantage of said women for financial gain.",

You can see this in how closely policies line up with the BITE model (behavior control, information control, thought control, emotional control). \n\nSo I guess my thesis statement is that if you round up FDS to just being a group of women you don't like bitching about men, you've missed the really significant mechanism for how it is operating. You're seeing the part you find hurtful or offensive, but being unable to see past that you're missing what's really being done at the center of things. \n\n* So we're going to first need people in binary catatgories. There are high and low-value men. There are queens and pickmeshas. There's no middle ground, you either have value or you don't. Be alpha or be a beta cuck. Be a chad or a manlet. We've now created strong in-group and out-group identies. \n* Next, lingo. We're going to create a bunch of words and terminology specific to our community that have specific definitions that only we use. Scrotes, pickmeshas, monkeybranching, AFBB, hypergamy, LVM, NVM, etc. etc. Giving you language specific to this philosophy to think in shapes your thoughts and your ability to communicate about situations to a specific series of jargon all set to reinforce a specific set of ideas. \n* There's going to be some actually helpful advice. Vet guys before you give them too much emotional attachment. Don't proceed hoping he's going to improve. (I could list RP/MGTOW/Incel examples here too if you're interested). This is very basic advice about self-respect and boundaries that a lot of people need to hear and it feels great to have someone talking about your problems like they are real and offering solutions. \n* Typically the group is going to *say* in their literature and philosophical pieces that you can kind of take what's useful and use it how you want to. It usually pitches itself as kind of flexible and you can do whatever you want. But in *practice*, being in the group means that no one else is supportive of that. If you come in saying \"Look, I like what you say about vetting, but I love kinky sex and I am going to keep doing that\", the group is really hostile to diverging from the plan. The only thing bringing this group together is a strong adherence to the doctrine, and working against it or questioning it will cause the in-group to shun you and try to talk you out of it. You are told that if you're not on board with the entire package of ideas, you're weak or still thinking like the outgroup and you'll be pressured to accept in-group ideas. \n* A huge portion of energy will be spent looking at fear-based and anger-based examples that reinforce the needs of the group. Incels will look at chadfishing, Mgtow will post articles about paternity fraud, redpill will post tinder studies that reinforce hypergamy, and FDS is going to post about scrotes fucking over women. He left his wife after her cancer diagnosis. Look at this unhappy marriage and how she married a LVM and now she's stuck with kids. This creates a loop. The loop is you go to the site, you get angry and afraid, you rage in the comments about how [inert group here] has the right ideas, and then you come back and do it all over again. You end up kind of addicted to the anger and fear because you see things that are painful in the real world or online and you run back to the people you know will react the way you want them to and you just live that way. It keeps you coming back to their site again and again so that it becomes a significant part of your day. \n* Outside thought and critique is harmful. We can't let people participate here who aren't believers, we have to excise members who aren't taking the whole idea set at once, and we have to make sure that we're never really talking with outsiders about what we think, because that could challenge the opinions. We're going to constantly talk about our haters and how we're unpopular and everyone wants to shut us down, because persecution is a strong motivation to stay in the in-group. We're going to use fake or extreme examples of critique so poorly thought out that we can mock it as a kind of false example of engaging with outside thought, but it's largely a strawman to reinforce in-group thought. \n* Practical results aren't required. You don't have to get the thing you were promised to stay here. You don't see women fleeing the sub when they find their HVM and go off to live a perfectly happy life. There will be highly fictionalized and, by any rational standard, imaginary \"success\" stories posted from time to time, but largely you won't see an exodus of people who are successful and get to leave the group. There's no actual plan for people to succeed and move on. There's no endgame. People joined to manage their pain over bad relationships, but the goal shifts to being about your membership in the in-group and not really about your outside life and how this is really playing out in terms of your dating experiences. And some people will see *some* positive results of course, because there are some practical nuggets of advice scattered around, but it won't usually result in the wholesale change promised. \n* This is the point where you realize you could go back and replace FDS with Scientology and this list would look pretty much exactly the same. \n* If it isn't working, you're not doing it right. People who get frustrated that they aren't seeing results promised are told that they are just not embracing the philosophy the right way, and if they try harder they will get the results they are looking for. This is always a case of user failure and never prompts anyone to consider if the philosophy is actually sound. \n* People have a very hard time leaving. You can stop hanging out with the group, you can physically leave the site, but you've been indoctrinated in a way of thinking about people and human behavior that is really hard to unwind. I know, because I spend a lot of time talking to people trying to unwind the thoughts they've internalized. You're used to thinking in the lingo and the philosophical terms you are used to that needing to unlearn that is painful and difficult. \n\n\nI could go on. \n\nYou say FDS is about little more than hating men. I'd argue it is about a LOT more. It is really important that people be able to identify this kind of group structure on sight. No one joins because they hate men. They join because they are frustrated in dating and feel like they are being used or taken advantage of and they want strategies to avoid painful experiences and find what they are looking for. It's what happens afterward that causes the problem. These groups are happening a lot online and you should be able to see these common elements and label them and recognize them on sight. Are they giving you a bunch of new lingo and terminology? Are they dividing people into classes and groups with hard, binary features? Are they using rage and fear to keep you interested in the material? Big, big red flags.",

It‚Äôs likely these are women who serially date unemployed men who are takers, who disrespect them, who spend more time at the gym than with them.
