    "CMV: Philosophy education should be mandatory curriculum in high school.\nLet's start by clarifying the minimum condition that I am arguing for. I believe there should be, *at the very least*, a one year class at the senior level (no less than junior level but senior would be ideal) that covers 101/intro-level text and ideas. \n\n**Why philosophy is important to everyone, not just philosophers**: virtually every aspect of our lives, no matter who or where you are, is intimately altered by the various structures of power and decision making surrounding us whether that be governments and laws, corporate policies, or the decisions ordinary individuals make on a daily basis. All of these decisions and behaviors are immediately underpinned by ethics or morality and the often intense disagreements in how we evaluate them. You can hardly name a political issue that doesn't invoke strong if not intense fundamental moral disagreements. The world has been in a state of strife regarding capitalist institutions for as long as they have existed. There remains a massive division in attitudes toward interpersonal relationships regarding things like sexuality and race which at their most extreme have led to regular acts of violence and terrorism. The connective tissue between all of this is that we have these wildly inconsistent and disoriented world-views that constantly clash because of their incompatibility but philosophy promises us the possibility of a solution. Philosophy suggests that there is an identifiable truth that could correct and align these entanglements, that we could work through a system of logical and critical thinking to find resolution and peace through a coherent and discoverable truth to these polarizing questions. In short, I argue that every one of us basically understands that ethics and morality are indispensable foundations to human living and that the skill set of being able to critically evaluate these things is likewise important. It follows then that we should be extremely interested in making sure all citizens have a basic, working understanding of philosophy so that they have the tools to navigate the moral decisions they make throughout their lives at the individual level, the international and political level, and everywhere between.\n\nFinally, I want to briefly summarize the structure of philosophy and make it clear why it is needed in its entirety and not *just* the ethics component. If we start by defining philosophy as the discipline of trying to identify and make coherent the most fundamental truths of life and the universe, what should become evident is a certain structure or flow of logic from the starting point to the finish. The most fundamental set of questions that must be answered are those of \"what makes things true?\" and \"what is knowledge? how do we come to know something rather than merely believe it?\". This is the branch of *epistemology*. It follows that we cannot exactly determine ethical truths if we haven' t even defined what truth is in the first place. Next we deal with questions of *metaphysics* that all stem from the question \"what is real?\". It does us little good to attempt to reconcile moral disagreements if we don't agree about the nature of reality. Do we have free will? Does a god exist who makes demands of us? Do \"rights\" actually exist in some sense or did we just make them up? All of these are metaphysical questions that need to be answered before we can find answers about morality. After our predicates of knowledge and reality are established we can start asking questions of \"what is right and wrong?\", or *ethics*, and using this come to agreements over how to approach government, laws, and international relations. This is philosophy in a nutshell and we need all of it, not just ethics, to make coherent and consistent decisions.\n\nTo conclude, I believe fully that highschool juniors or seniors would be fully capable of and immeasurably benefited by philosophical education. It would create the conditions we need for our society to escape this environment of perpetual strife, confusion, polarization, and manipulation that is the beating heart of most or even all of our current problems as a species.\n\nEdit: Just want to say before I forget: thanks to everyone for the engagement. I'm very pleasantly surprised by how much feedback and respectful debate I've seen. I'm pretty new to Reddit (my account is a year old but I've only actually been active for the last month or two) so I don't quite understand the awards or what they do or signify, but I always see people thanking others for them so they must be at least somewhat meaningful, so thank you for those too!": [

If they remain unsolved (or if they're eventually solved), they wouldn't impact people's lives dramatically compared to curing cancer, solving poverty or climate change, or even finding a cure for balding.\n\nPhilosophy and philosophers don't have a place in modern society because there are bigger problems to solve than \"who we are\" and \"what are things\". When all problems are solved and no person has issues at all, then it is beneficial to focus on philosophical problems.

And I even got good grades effortlessly!\n\nBut did it benefit me intellectually? No. Honestly, my philosophical thinking has been better improved by being online and talking with people. Because, the problem a lot of philosophy classes have is that the teacher is just BORING. They're all nerds who have a great passion for philosophy, but since they're teaching uninterested high schoolers, they can't get as deep into it as they want and almost nobody in the class is as fascinated by the subject as they are. So they stay with simple, easy subjects who are simultaneously kinda hard because they don't have time to get into the principles of philosophy and they can't explain what you're supposed to do and how you're supposed to write.\n\nI don't doubt that philosophy is a fascinating subject -but not for everyone. It IS good when you have experience with it, when you know the rules, when you have read lots of philosophical papers to have some general ideas of what things are.

            "text": "I will first make a caveat that I think that a grasp of basic philosophy would be useful for a nations citizens, if only to help guard against propaganda, and have them question cultural values.\n\nThat said, your proposal will not solve the problems you claim it will solve. The idea that people will just realize that they should support a better world, calls into question the nature of said world, and brings up the people who are incentivized to act against it, and the forces opposing your goals, such as propaganda to sway the populace.\n\nLets take terrorism. You think that everyone being educated in philosophy would stop that? That it would make people sit down in rational discussion, and just debate it out? Of course it wouldn't, because there are a myriad of reasons radicalisation happens.\n\nLets look at a case. This can be the topical issue in Israel and Palestine. Lets set aside the anti-semites for a moment, and focus on what motives Hamas, or the Israeli government might have to continue the struggle. Hamas knows that it can retain power by continually radicalising the populace to maintain its support. And at this point, there are legitimate greivances the palestinians have against the actions of the state of Israel, such as the maintenance of an apartheid state, the settlers, the violence and evictions, and the original grievance of displacing the populace in favor of Israeli citizens. Israel on the other hand was a state born in the aftermath of the worst genocide in human history, surrounded by neighbors hostile or unsympathetic, and the periodic rocket fire from Hamas serves to continue to keep the right wing in power there. I am not going to argue for either side in this thread, as it defeats the point. But needless to said, the issue is complicated, and philosophy will not solve it.\n\nNow lets look at some issues that you oppose, and take a look to see what the cause is. The war on terror, the war on drugs, and the recent behavior of antivaxxers during the pandemic.\n\nThe War on Terror is not a result of people not knowing philosophy. It is a result of political maneuvering, and it will never end. Sure, it might be a failure and waste of lives and resources, but the United States as an entity benefits geopolitically from being able to maintain it. And as long as it does so, it will not end it. \n\nSimilar to the War on Drugs. It was a move based on political expedience, an explicitly racist move meant to garner votes and suppress problematic elements in American society. The War on Drug is not a failure, because it is doing exactly what it is intended to do. Every nonviolent criminal locked away for decades, is an intentional desired outcome, and knowledge of philosophy does not alter the way people gain political power. Now, with decriminalization instituted in numerous states, one might be tempted to chalk it up to us knowing more, being better informed about the relative risk of substances. And that is a mistake, because what is happening, is that it is no longer as politically useful to ban marijuana in those states. Being able to decriminalize and tax it are more useful, especially as the opinions of the population shift.\n\nOf all of these, only the antivaxxers perhaps could be improved by this, but even then, I would be skeptical of the efficacy. You can have all the tools needed to question your core beliefs, and understand the world through a different lens, but at the end of the day, they are just tools. It still falls to the antivaxxers to take those steps, willingly step out of their comfort zone, and admit that not only they are wrong, but they are a dangerous ideology which is causing the injury and death of people, especially those close to them. \n\nAntivaxxers fundementally live in a different worldview. In their worldview, they are the ones who are right, who know things the population doesn't. Others are being mislead, but they have the ability to wake them up. Its a worldview which reinforces and is reinforced by distrust and lack of understanding of the systems around them, and the perceived intelligence of the person. People fundementally like to think they are smarter, they know better, they know the secret but everyone else is wrong. Thats why conspiracy theories are so prevalent. And they oftentimes surround themselves with people who agree with them, and social media which both agrees and sticks them in an echo chamber. And so they are perfectly happy not vaccinating their children.\n\nThe reality that they willfully ignore, is one which they do not want to live in. They do not want to live in the reality that they were duped by snake oil remedies, that they have been spreading an ideology which makes them a genuine danger to society. It inverts the dynamic. No longer are they the smart ones, they are the stupid ones. No longer are they in the know, they are being conned. Their friends are all in the same situation, and are actively being duped. The person may have duped some of their friends into that same con, and in turn may have originally been duped into it, which calls into question those relationships, especially when they make is such a big part of their identity. And finally, they have to come to terms with the fact that in trying to save their loved ones, usually their children, they are willfully putting them at risk of injury and death.\n\nAgain, I think it might have some use in preventing the situation in the first place, but there are plenty of college educated antivaxxers already, and we can see what they are doing.",

He was looking for a way to make more money, so he started sub teaching at the local Magnet (honors or whatever) school, and happened to end up covering for the philosophy class right off the bat. He's excited! Young minds eager to learn and the teacher says \"Sure it's free discussion!\" (lesson was on nietzsche if you were curious). So he's reading up, getting ready, and goes in...\nAnd they're utterly disinterested in anything not explicitly on the lesson plan. No discussion, just a quiet study hallesque class, where he takes attendance, and sits there reading, because the students don't gaf. See, they have mandatory testing, and testing in general, and so they just lump one more thing into the \"gotta get a good grade so I can get into college/whatever\" pile. \n\nIn the USA, the education system is set up to turn out students who got good grades, and are taught to tests and measurable statistics. Sure, this is one classroom, at one school, but I'd bet it's a general microcosm of what happens in these kinds of classes most places. \n\nthe desire for epistemology you seem to want would be a lost cause anyway.

However, I think that the idea that studying philosophy is to be promoted **because it make people/society better** is a separate claim and it is not at all clear that it is true.\n\nFirst, it is not part of the aim/curriculum of academic philosophy to make people or society better, any more than it is part of studying economics that it will make you good at money, or mathematics that it will make you good at counting (see this short [essay](https://3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2018/10/moral-laziness.html) on this point)\n\nSecond, while underexplored, the empirical evidence does not support the claim. In particular, various countries such as France have had compulsory high school philosophy courses for some time but they do not seem to be doing much better at intense disagreements than anyone else (e.g. populist racialist politics: Marine Le Pen [might well have won](https://www.economist.com/europe/2017/04/29/if-france-used-americas-system-marine-le-pen-might-have-won) the last French presidential election if the voting system was the same as the US, and she looks set to make the run-off again this time)",

Your argument sounds like its a bit based on Descartes (cogito ergo sum in this bitch. The matrix ain't got shit on me), but Descartes came to this philosophical epiphany - the one true certainty - in an attempt to lay a groundwork for mathematics: it's not at all straightforward to work from that single truth toward... Complex truths. \n\nThe reality is that for complex (moral and ethical) situations, philosophy doesn't generally agree to a single logical conclusion. It's not even agreed on what it means to be free or on what it means to be human, and philosophy teaches you about how different philosophers disagree on these things and on ethics rather than that there is a single, agreeable truth. \n\nAddit: The reason I would like philosophy to be in the educative curriculum is therefore quite the opposite : it's because a study of philosophy shows that as well as how making different assumptions and working from different perspectives leads to different conclusions. I believe and hope that such knowledge could lead to people being more accepting of other people's perspectives and conclusions, and more experience with logical thought will allow people to find logical discrepancies in their own and others thought processes.",

To give you some background, we have 4 years of mandatory high school, and then two years that are elective, but you have to do them to go to university. Most people do them. There, those two years, philosophy is a subject that you have to study, and in fact, when you do the exam to access university, you have to either pick philosophy or contemporary history. So, most of the people I know have studied kant, descartes, karl marx, all of that. We also had, for a few years, a mandatory subject about political and ethical issues (educacion para la ciudadania, which translates to 'education for citizenship') in the first four years of highschool. This subject was following a recommendation by the EU that states should educate about morals and how to live in society, but it tanked after being accused of being too 'indoctrinating' because the state 'should not be assuming the task of morally educating people'. More on that later.\n\nIn regards to that philosophy subject, I have not seen it affect people's lives, views on politics, or ethics or whatever. People still vote what they feel is best according to their values, which as I see it, are either inherited from their parents or are in radical opposition, and are more influenced by the recent past (we spent a good portion of last century in a dictatorship, which left scars that still affect the politics). Ethics and morals, most people just go by what their religion says, and those who are atheist mostly go with what society says. I am seeing a recent change in this, with young people challenging things that have traditionally been seen as 'moral' (such as blackface, don't get me started on that), but again, I have a feeling that it has way more to do with global access to internet and issues being discussed to great extent online than those philosophy lessons that we have mostly forgotten about. \n\nI am not saying that philosophy was ever a bad subject, indeed, we had very interesting conversations that were sparked by it, but ultimately, I don't think that it had a real effect on how we as a society interact with each other or with the institutions, not enough to make it mandatory where it is not. I feel that time would be better spend learning about house economics, or about how to researh online and how to fact-check stuff, learning one more language, things like that. \n\nAlso, I may agree that schools should provide moral education, but with recent historical events like the dictatorship we suffered, the recent resurgence of far right political groups that are attempting to push their ideals into the school system, and some other things that have recently happened in my country, and my personal experience in a strict catholic school, I can see how people would oppose to the idea of the state teaching ethics to minors. Because, as much as I think that the subject never did much to change anyone's views, I can see how it could be used to push a political agenda, and even if it caused little to no damage, the insult it would be to democracy could be enough. In the end, those in government are as human as you and I, and I don't really trust humans not to abuse their power.",

Sadly like history, etc).\n\nFWIW I'm strongly convinced psychology should be taught in schools too, and starting at a young age — how to manage one's emotion, how to process social situations, how to better use thinking, etc. From a mostly practical perspective (think CBT and the likes) with minimal theory to ground concepts.\n\nIronically enough, there is a line — say from Stoics to CBT — that currently sits entirely out of the realm of \"official\" (scholar, academic) transmission of knowledge. Nowadays you need to go into pop-infamous \"self-help\" and other coach/guru work (some awesome, some crooks) to find that knowledge in a modern form. Which is a frakking disgrace, if you ask me, not to help people systematically with all these things they then spend decades and thousands of dollars correcting in themselves.\n\nAnyway, I didn't change your view I'm afraid, but I wanted to caution on the fact that merely adding something to a curriculum isn't gonna cut it circa 2021. The underlying premise that a school curriculum is enriching the mind (let alone real-world real-life skills) is broken.\n\nSince it's probably a *hard problem* to fix education itself, of the collective form I mean, it's probably better to aim at having philosophy study and teaching/training be a staple of parental education — one of those \"must do\", like parents learn basic medicine and nutrition and whatever else to tend to their child's needs. I think that has a much better chance of success in the long run, because once it's become cultural, it'll naturally pervade all of society (including school education). But it's the long road: your solution takes 1 good year of activism but has seldom chances to change anything IMHO (even likely to falsely give the impression that \"philosophy is useless\" if done the wrong way); whereas changing culture itself progressively takes 10, 20 years of activism. But I believe it can be done for philosophy because it used to be like that until the turn of the 20th century — when \"philosophy\" became a strictly scholarly matter and its practical branch, i.e. \"recipes for a good living\", was ostracized (for being too down to earth, not intellectual enough I suppose) and progressively exited the mainstream narrative. This practical branch used to be called philosophy and it's what the word meant to most people, it was cultural to ask these questions. Now it's called \"self-help\" and those noble ideas need to be taken back, owned anew by everyone. Otherwise, frankly, we're doomed to collapse sooner rather than later.",

Every day there are hundreds of millions of people walking around who were taught mathematics for over a decade in school, and can't perform basic arithmetic. School doesn't work. If you want people to learn philosophy, that's one thing. But to want it to be taught in school is just pointless. The curriculum is not the issue, the institution has simply failed. It's probably the largest failed experiment within the context of human society.\n\nIf you want people to learn/know philosophy, then it must become part of social morEs, popular culture, children's games, etc, etc. Adding one more crappy subject to be taught by underpaid, underqualified, untalented \"educators\" in a prison of an institution where kids are forced to waste half their youth is not going to go a very long way to benefiting their lives.\n\nEven if you could somehow defeat the impossible difficulties of actually teaching stuff in school, you have to consider that the curriculum for standardized education is quite possibly the absolute worst vehicle for conveying any nuanced representation of anything. It's the worst possible delivery system for philosophy. It can work for propaganda. If you wanna make kids memorize that Hitler bad and Washington good, it's an excellent vector, but any amount of nuance and it immediately breaks down. You simply can't mass-produce individualism.",

As such teaching philosophy to a high school student is pretty much always a lost cause because most of them are too young and lack the general knowledge necessary to really grasp it. Or you’d have to structure other courses around it, like history or classical litterature, which seem highly unlikely.

We already have a problem with a \"[skills gap](https://hbr.org/2014/08/employers-arent-just-whining-the-skills-gap-is-real)\" and workforce preparedness. How do you justify teaching philosophy if people who finish K-12 or even college don't have marketable skills?\n4. If you want students to learn critical thinking, civic literacy, and so forth, there are probably easier and more obvious places to start than a full-on philosophy class. In principle, you could revise the curriculums in various language arts and social studies classes. But that would also mean retraining existing teachers or hiring new ones.\n\nThe ideal setting to learn philosophy is in a seminar led by a highly capable instructor and highly motivated, curious, and intelligent students. That kind of thing is very labor-intensive and expensive.\n\nAs much as it pains me to say it, a good liberal arts education really is a luxury, especially when we're falling short of much more basic needs, like basic literacy, numeracy, and life skills.",
