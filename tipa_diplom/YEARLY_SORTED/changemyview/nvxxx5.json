    "CMV: Nothing makes me angrier than calling a customer service number and needing to TALK to get through the menus.\nNothing boils my blood quicker than for example calling fedex, getting to an automated menu, and having a patronizing voice on the other end ask me with fake sweetness \"what do you need?\", requiring me to use my ACTUAL VOICE to talk to a maddening menu robot. Instantly ruins whatever good mood I'm in. \n\nI CAN NOT imagine a world in which this technology is simpler for the company than just having you press buttons. What I imagine is someone did the market research and thought that the customer liked this better than pressing the buttons. Anyway change my view i don't want to be like this": [
