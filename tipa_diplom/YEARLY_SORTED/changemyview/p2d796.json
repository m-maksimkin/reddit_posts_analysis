    "CMV: The average American would lose to a Goose in a fight\nHi all, [after reading this link](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thelondoneconomic.com/lifestyle/eight-per-cent-of-americans-think-they-could-beat-an-elephant-in-a-fight-269759/%3famp) I put a lot of thought into the average American’s fighting ability unarmed and found them… wanting. Now I know there have been no goose related deaths of a human on record (only two from mute swans as far as water foul goes) but there seem to have been plenty of broken bones anecdotally, and I’ve seen enough warnings about being wary of geese.\n\nI am having trouble finding exact data on geese related injuries, so that is one way I could have my mind changed. If the data shows a clear record of man winning in unarmed fights, that would be fairly strong evidence.\n\nI do think the *average* person has the sense to run from an approaching goose though, which could skew the data toward those not living in fear of our waterfowl overlords.\n\nAt the very least an American has no chance against a flying goose that attacks first, they can fly up to 60 mph, that hit alone from a dive bomb would take out the average man.\n\nAnyway, change my mind! Make me feel safe from these feathery tyrants!\n\nEdit: it’s been 3 hours, and I must work. I may be back to answer later.\n\nArguments I have already awarded deltas for:\n\n1. Flying attacks are not a thing\n\n2. Geese are very different from swans.\n\n3. Videos of geese being beaten by average looking people\n\nEdit: 4:30pm holy cow that’s a lot of responses, I am back.\n\nWant to clarify I did say no weapons. Only unarmed.\n\nI do consider backing off to be a loss so not necessarily to the death here.": [

It takes 4,000 newtons of force to break a major bone (say, the femur) in his body, and he punches with around 2,000 newtons of force. Just falling over, he creates about 1,000 newtons of force.\n* In the left corner, we have **the average Canadian goose.** He stands an impressive 3' tall, and weighs about 10 lbs. It takes a whopping 200 newtons of force to break a major bone in his body -- and, flying at 60 mph, he can strike a target with 1,600 newtons of force.\n\nSo ... your average American could just ... fall over on the goose, and it would be 5x the force necessary to break every bone in its body, whereas your goose (flying as fast as its goosey wings can carry it), wouldn't be even be able to break the human's bones (although all its own bones would disintegrate on impact).\n\nSo basically, as long as it's a fight to the death and no one gets to run away, eventually the goose *will* lose, because physics.",

Unless they are dueling in an empty void, there would be an environment that the human could utilize and assess to locate tools of some sort, ie a rock or a stick, that would imply advantage.\n\n3) geese are terrifically strong, but I doubt they have as much of a latent understanding of death and the organ failure required as an average human would. I certainly wouldn’t discount a goose having a high capability to main (edit: autocorrect changed from “maim”), but to actually go for a kill of something that isn’t inherently prey is more of a reach for me.

We far outweigh geese, have opposable thumbs and 4 limbs to work with in our attacks (geese have at best 2 offensive limbs, and those are mostly for show), have better cognitive abilities, and are far stronger. The only thing that geese have going for them is their beaks and their teeth, one of which humans have as well. It wouldn't take much to get a goose in a headlock and overpower them and win the fight, but the human will get some scrapes and puncture wounds in the process.\n\nAns a goose dive-bombing a human at 60mph like you suggest would kill the goose before it would kill the human. And a fight where both parties die simultaneously (in this case, upon impact from a projectile goose) would be a draw, not a loss for the human.",

As far as winning a fight, a goose has almost no ability to defeat a human, if we define winning as causing sufficient harm to your opponent that they are unable to continue fighting.  As for the human side of the equation, it is easy to kill or incapacitate a goose.  One solid kick from a typical human adult could cause fatal injuries easily.  At the end of the day, for all their aggression, geese are still birds, with their hollow bones and tiny brains.  \n\nThey depend primarily on their ultra-aggressive behavior to bewilder and frighten off attackers and predators, but if it comes down to actually fighting, they really have no chance against an adult human willing to actually engage them.  They bite hard, it hurts and leaves welts and lacerations, but short of a luck bite to the testicles, they have no way of causing a truly incapacitating injury.\n\nGeese also don't attack from the air the way you describe.  In fact, what you are describing (a dive-bomb attack) would cause relatively minor injuries to a human in the worst case (*maybe* a concussion if a large goose slammed full speed into your head) but would be invariably fatal to the goose.  They aren't sleek and nimble birds of prey with wicked talons that would strafe you and tear you apart with precision airborne attacks. Now some eagles and hawks could shred a human pretty badly without putting themselves at much risk with an airborne assault, but a goose?  No.\n\nGeese don't so much *win* fights as *discourage* fights with them.  And it works.  Why the hell would anybody want to fight a stupid bird?

The dude can hardly walk or stand up straight. I promise his reflexes aren’t in top shape. All you really need is to not be afraid of geese, they really can’t do anything. Like honestly, so what if they bite you? Grab their neck like this guy and Drag them where you need them.\n\nThe only way that I can see a human losing to a goose is if it fought *like a goose*, flapping, screeching, and flailing. But if it fights like a human, grabbing, grappling, controlling, there’s just simply no way a goose is doing anything. The average person could absolutely very easily grab its neck and just fall on it, breaking all kinds of things on the goose in the process. Or literally just grab a part like neck, wing, legs, etc in two hands and break it. \n\nThis is also negating the most probable concept of how we got to be so dominant anyway- tools. Anyone can pick up a rock and splinter a gooses skull. Or flick out a pocket knife and slash that long vulnerable neck real quick. \n\nOr are you saying the true root to humans potential failure against geese is the fact that we are reluctant to hurt them- not that we aren’t capable?",

Yes Redditors, I have not only lost a fight with a goose ( and have a tiny scar as a reminder!) I have also won a fight with a different goose! \n\nWhere I live we have several parks with duck ponds scattered across the coast. In my hometown as a kid I adored feeding the ducks. I've always been a big animal lover. It's actually a really common activity. The lake also has a paddle boat rental and playground, so it's a great place to visit on the weekends, especially for families. When I was just a little nugget my dad took me to feed the ducks. When I ran out out of food to give the ducks went on their way, but a giant ( to me, I was 3 or 4) goose became insistent. It bit, drew blood, knocked me down with it's flapping wings, and screamed in my face. It gave me a whole geese issue. I don't like them, and avoid them if at all possible, even as an adult. I run away, and I feel zero shame about it!\n\nAs a parent my own daughter enjoyed feeding the ducks, although there are very rarely geese at our local pond. You are more likely to encounter swans or seagulls along with the ducks. 40 minutes south is a whole different situation. Their duck pond has the most aggressive, huge ass geese around. They are mean, fast, and stand head high at my shoulder. \nI was not aware of that on our first visit. When those giant geese converged on my daughter, I went full combat mode. As I earlier mentioned I'm an animal lover, but this was war! I won that day, and although thinking about it makes me feel like a jerk, I don't regret it. Especially after hearing other parents horror stories with that particular swarm of feathered assassins. \n\nIf you happen to visit the California Coast BEWARE OF THE FRIGGIN GEESE!",

The average American weighs 180 lbs, and 42.4% of American adults are obese. \n\nAn average, non-overweight American may be taken down by a surprise attack, sure. The other comments have disproven that.\n\nBut imagine the 42.4%. Imagine a goose divebombing an American. It goes for their neck…. but where is their neck? Oh, that’s right, it’s covered by freedom chins, a natural defense mechanism. The goose attempting to attack that would end horrifically as it falls to the ground, and the obese American ends its life in one foul swoop—and it has a multitude of ways of accomplishing that.\n\nNow, the goose sees this alternate timeline, blessed and so it recalibrates, attempting to go for the American’s stomach. It readies its beak, wings, and claws, before lodging itself into 300 pounds of the second amendment. 22% of Americans own a gun. If the goose happens to be up against one of those armed sons of bitches… it stands still as the master warrior against chiner cocks its gun and sets their sight for its demonic little head.\n\nSurely then, the goose could try to trip the American. As it would have a rough time getting up. Let’s say somehow this is possible, and the obese American can’t just punt it back to its honky hellhole. The goose picks and claws at the human’s knees (from the front. If it fells it from the back, it can’t do anything, as it’ll just fall forward), and successfully punctures the human’s knee. David has felled Goliath, and he will reap his rewards. \n\nBut… what’s this? The obese american, the apex predator, will once again assert their dominance. As they fall, the goose, attempting to flee, is crushed under the weight of the American. A heavy diet of high fructose corn syrup has prepared them for this moment, the ability to crush much smaller predators in a last ditch survival moment.\n\nGeese, while hellish, have no successful way of attacking even an obese american.",

I have 3 young children and we have had countless goose related encounters.\n\nPut bluntly I have killed a lot of geese in my life.  I can tell you from first hand experience, that a goose has zero chance in a fight against a human, down to as young as 3 years old.\n\nFirst, they are not an agile creature on land, it is very easy to grab the neck, and even unathletic people can do so with ease.

My criteria for being able to win a fight with a goose is be 4 years of age or older and be able to lift at least 15 lbs.  The rest is trivial, the neck breaks with so little effort, my kid is more than strong enough if he wants to.  At this point he just needs a goose to stand its ground, and he will get one, but a goose wont stand its ground because the goose knows what I'm saying is true.\n\nPeople are afraid of them because they have a very intimidating hiss and can use there wings to come off as much larger than they actually are.

They will sit in the road when cars are approaching and allow themselves to get hit. Basically crane version of dodo. Anyways they're highly protected and it's punishable with jail for violating laws pertaining to them. Anyways. Here's a story. I once was walking through the woods with my at the time girlfriend on our way to a nice picnic. We had a basket and everything. Anyways we pass a pod of sand cranes and they start following us. My gf starts freaking out and I keep assuring her that they're just birds and they can't do anything. I start trying to shoe them away and it works for the most part. Except one starts sprinting at my gf who is now holding the basket. She drops it and all the food goes everywhere. I turn around and start trying to scare the bird off and picking up the food in the process. The thing starts trying to peck me and has its feather out bowing up to me. I notice its brethren coming for back up so I have to act quick. As it lunged at me I am ashamed to say that instincts took over and I did onto that bird what the hulk did to loki in the avengers the noises It made were terrifying. Something undescribable from a nightmare.  About 8 or so slams I lassoed it into space like team rocket. \n\n\nAll jokes aside the bird was fine and I would frequently feed the pod in my neighborhood post incident.",

            "text": "Just for the record, I have in a way actually fought a goose. \n\nLong story short, when I was about 10 years old I was always spending time after school at a friends house. He happened to love in a subdivision that has a large park with rather big pond as well. This is pond VERY populated with ducks and geese, in the water and usually in a few the spots on the shoreline. \n\nSo one day my friend and I get off the bus after school and go to his house to find that a white duck that must’ve been right on the brink of maturity had hurt it’s wing in a way that grounded it. Luckily since it was still on the younger side, we were able to nurse it and it actually stayed as a pet of sorts with that friends and family while the wing healed. This took about two months and we became very close with a duck, who we named  “AFLAC”. He would follow us around the backyard as we pretended to sword fight or whatever else we were doing for fun, until one day after those two months we came home from school to see that he had disappeared.\n\nA few days later we went to the park to play, Only for AFLAC to quite literally fly over to us as soon as he saw that we were there. This amazing duck then would follow us around or walk in front of us. And as we were walking we realized quickly that any time we came within a certain distance of other dogs or a goose AFLAC would honk loudly and then chase off whoever got to close to us (in his opinion). By this time he was a fully matured male duck and was larger than the Mallards, and any other ducks in that park. Only thing out sizing him was the geese/swans. He would do this every time we came to the park to play for the couple years more we played there. He also absolutely knew what his name was and would come to my friend and I if we called him. By the time I was about 13 and growing out of playing at the park with friends, I remember going there the last time I actually saw AFLAC. We walked around the pond like we normally did only instead of running off the geese that we want to by like usual, He was only being aggressive towards the ducks that happen to be in our path. Then I realized as we came up upon a group of geese that seemed as if they were waiting for us, that he had had a run-in with them they didn’t go well. I knew that because once we got within 15 feet of the three geese in question they with no other way to explain it, “jumped” him. \n\nI can only tell you that I became angry and protective in a way that pet owners and parents usually do. He was surrounded by them, and they’re constant pecking with their beaks along with the fact that they were using their wings to barricade him from getting away or even stretch his wings to fly. \n\nAfter realizing that they weren’t going to stop anytime soon and that he was fighting the best he could Just to protect himself, I ran over there and immediately grabbed one of them by the neck and without jerking his neck or applying to much pressure I simply calling it a few meters away. Then the geese turned on me after that, and I quite literally punched one of them in the head and use my foot to keep it at distance. The only duck I had yet to touch was doing his best to harm me in a way that made me instantly realize that although I may be trying to protect AFLAC I don’t want to harm geez geez I just want them gone. So with the goose I punched finally relenting, After I saw him turn to walk away I focus my attention on the loan docs still attacking me and then placed my foot under its breast and lifted in a way that allowed me to, well…  “punt” the goose towards the pond at least a couple meters. It wasn’t a kick, but more a lifting and flinging. \n\nThese were also apparently a gang of geese that would terrorize small children, because some random mother of some kids that were fishing immediately came in asking me first off if I was OK, which was funny because I actually had a couple bruises from being pecked.  I expected her to be anything but happy with me after seeing what had happened. \n\nShe said she had saw the whole thing and thanked me for “teaching them a lesson”. Another lady then came out of nowhere as apparently she had seen what happened but only the parts AFTER I had become their target and had gotten AFLAC safe. She was understandably under the impression that I was just some random preteen venting his anger on animal or something like that, but luckily the other lady explained with insistent that I appreciated that this was just me protecting my duck. \n\nOn that note, fuck geese.",

            "text": "This is absolutely fascinating to find your write up here. I was asserting at work today that an attacking territorial goose would pose a real, imminent danger/threat to most human beings, particularly if the goose was able to get in close/at a short range, there were no weapons or specialized armored apparel or gear worn in preparation, AND escape by running farther off from the goose was either limited or totally null from the scenario. \n\nI argued that, in fact, under these conditions, a assaulting territorially motivated goose would possibly even stand a good chance of killing a man, whomever that man was unlucky enough to be put in this fucked up gladiator-esque with a water-fowling twist battle ring of mine in the scenario. \n\nFirst, I should state that all of them scoffed at the potential damage a goose beak would be capable of inflicting at all, describing it as a dull unremarkable barely weapon. They also seemed confident that they would be capable of simply just snapping the goose's neck smoothly and with total ease, like they would not require any training or specialized skill to wring the neck of an agitated offensive goose in a snap and without any risk of failure. \n\nI thought this was really odd and mentioned that maybe they had not ever truly dealt with Aggressive Geese before, with being chased down, pursued, and assaulted by the birds. They laughed at me when I relayed the tale of a pair of Canadian Geese from the pond in my childhood that chased, haunted, and attempted to massacre me down EVERY single day, a small 5 year old child. \n\nIt was so fucking terrifying that I had nightmares but, even more, my 30 year old plus MOTHER was actually scared of these same two geese. She found them extremely threatening and felt they were out for blood and capable of taking it if their target simply stumbled or tripped in their race to escape. \n\nALSO, most Geese who become the aggressive  chasing monster goose I describe here do so because of their NEST, the EGGS they have laid with their mate nearby. So, that's fucking right, realistically guys, you dont take on one psycho murder goose at a time, it's almost always a conspiring group of TWO, a couplet, one male and one female, both savage as hell. \n\nI think majority of humans would get murked by the murderous rabid geese power couple team without the option of distance to run off. Let's be real. \n\nWe don't realize this because we are sheltered from that situation and because we don't live right next to where geese go all mr Jekyll mr Hyde and become a serial killing married couple like the Avian Ken and Barbie Killers. \n\nYou'd get slaughtered slowly and painfully by the goose.",
