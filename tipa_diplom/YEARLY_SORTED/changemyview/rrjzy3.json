    "CMV:If you illegally entered the Capitol on Jan 6, you should be ineligible for public office for at least 10 years.\nIf you respect the rule of law and the democratic process so little you were willing to forcefully disrupt it, you shouldn't be eligible to a representative participating in that process, no matter how well you may be liked. With so many of these people entering the electoral process, our democracy's ability to withstand attempts against it gets weaker. This shouldn't be tolerated as it represents a clear threat to a free society.\n\nThis should apply no matter your political affiliation. The more info that comes out on Jan 6, the more clear it becomes the unrest was the cover for a legitimate attempt at our democracy, by way of constant repitition of a false narrative (that millions now believe). If one side can simply decide they didn't lose an election, what's left?\n\nSIGN OFF UPDATE: Thanks for all the comments. I think I'm inclined to change position based upon the terrible precedent that would be set by being able to backdate punishments. As a note, the number of what I assume are conservatives who cannot tell the difference between protest, unrest, and disrupting a political process is too damn high. Thanks all, stay kind. \n\nETA: Links\n\nhttps://www.newsweek.com/these-13-candidates-who-were-stop-steal-january-6-are-running-office-2022-1663613\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/03/least-seven-jan-6-rallygoers-won-public-office-election-day/": [

So now you are trying to have consequences for merely being there and assuming their agenda. \n\nThis is exactly the reason why we have due process in this country. There was at least 10,000 people in attendance and only 727 arrests, many of them being held without bail. No treason or sedition has been charged either. Out of the thousands in attendance you are saying they all had bad intentions even though we've seen people just wandering around the capitol, and at least 70% of those in attendance didn't even enter the building. You are trying to criminalize behavior that isn't.\n\nI would like to know on what grounds you would like to distribute these punishments. They haven't even been charged with a crime, and any crime you are accusing them of is treason or sedition.\n\nHave you seen minority report? You arr trying to charge motivations, and it is not illegal to think things. You can think anything you want, and even have intent, however if there is no crime than there is no criminal behavior. \n\nHistory will show nobody in congress planned a thing, and if it doesn't than those people deserve to be charged, however simply being there and being a republican is not a crime, and thank God for due process and the protections of the legal system, because corruption would put everyone in attendance in jail who they hate without any cause. Even as we stand currently it's happening, like I said there have been people sitting in jail since the were caught for attending the jan 6th protest who are being [held without bail](https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/verify/why-capitol-riot-defendants-being-held-without-bond-before-trial-january-6-congress/65-1e4d4dd6-eded-4187-85f1-d4dfcc3a9519) even though most sentences [won't have jail time](https://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article256455696.html)\n\nThis whole scenario is a miscarriage of justice, and the circumstances you are trying to get to would be a travesty to the US legal framework. Thank God many people in charge understand that, I just wish more people who identified with being on the left could see how terrible this would be and is if they carried out their plans to penalize peaceful protesters.\n\nThink back to when CNN said [fiery but peaceful protests](https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnn-panned-for-on-air-graphic-reading-fiery-but-mostly-peaceful-protest-in-front-of-kenosha-fire) when 14,000 people were arrested, many released same day, 25 deaths and $2 billion worth of damage.\n\n In [2015 there was an interruption of congress by BLM](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/21/black-lives-matter-protesters-die-in-capitol-hill-longworth-office-building).\n\n[BLM storms Oklahoma capitol building](https://www.foxnews.com/us/blm-protesters-oklahoma-capitol-gop-bills-drivers-riot-police-doxxing-transgender)\n\nBLM protests were so costly, deadly, and interrupted so many official proceedings that Republicans [introduced legislation that increased punishment for unlawful activity during protests](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/blogs/stateline/2021/02/04/republicans-respond-to-black-lives-matter-with-anti-protest-bills) and was struck down in many places from the left\n\n[BLM interrupts mayor conference in chicago](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2016/1/21/black-lives-matter-activists-interrupt-us-mayors-conference.html)\n\nFollowing the announcement of Trump's election victory, large protests broke out across the United States including other countries such as Canada, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Philippines, Australia, Israel with some continuing for several days, and more protests planned for the following weeks and months. [Many called it an illegitimate election and attempts were made to overturn\n](https://biggs.house.gov/media/press-releases/house-democrats-vote-overturn-results-2016-election)\nSo the issue is with decertifying a legitimate election, which house democrats tried to do in 2016. Should none of them be allowed to run? It seems that you think werent involved on jan 6th, were involved in 2016 - 2020\n\nLastly, [Maxine waters encouraged supporters to harass Trump officials](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/25/politics/maxine-waters-trump-officials/index.html) that is actual sedition, and went unpunished\n\nOf course you can likely find things from both sides,  and of course there are many, many more from BLM, but it seems like they were against the rioting bill until they disliked the other side. Double standards are not welcome in a court of law, for good reason",

I guess most folks forgot what happened when Trump was sworn in 2016, the protests, the vandalism, and the burning of a limo in Washington DC and some folks crying like the world was coming to an end.   Hilary stating for years after that the Russians somehow helped to get Trump in and not the Americans who voted for the least \"bad\" candidate.\n\nJanuary 6 was a bad event not the worst event to happen in DC but it was bad and stupid.  What would have been worse if those pipe bombs planted in front of the DNC and RNC buildings, the night of January 5, had gone off.  They still haven't found the person or persons responsible for that.\n\nWhen the RNC had their convention at the White House a whole bunch of protestors, rioters and arsonists came to DC to play.  A building in the park that I think the Secret Service was using was burned down.  Several Secret Service agents guarding the White House were injured and Senator Rand Paul and his wife were attacked by a mob while leaving the White House, it was the cops surrounding them that saved them from serious harm.  But it must have been frightening for the Senator and his wife and various other politicians and private citizens were mobbed upon leaving the White House that night.\n\nSo, yeah, January 6 was bad but it was not an insurrection nor sedation, it was a bunch of stupid moronic folks some of whom had no clue what was going on and a few that took advantage of the chaos to do violence and vandalism.  Those who were violent/committed vandalism and are convicted in court should serve the appropriate term.  Unfortunately, a lot of folks who have been arrested have been left in solitary confinement for months and some will be released with no charges as broken people and others will be charged as trespassers and be broken.\n\nGood job everyone while those folks who burned, looted and killed during the BLM riots last year were bailed out by the same politicians that got voted in last year.\n\nEdit:  I would also like to add those who were in charge of security for the Capitol Building should be held responsible for the lack of enough security to prevent what happened from happening.  Who the hell made the decision to have minimal security that day?\n\nOnly one person was shot, a woman who if she had her day in court would probably have been charged with trespassing and vandalism and convicted which as far as I know are not death sentences.  But because this is event has become so political, some of those who should be held accountable for their actions or lack of actions that day will walk while those who were just wandering around the Capitol building unknowing will get the book thrown at them.  This dual justice should scare everyone no matter your political persuasion.",
