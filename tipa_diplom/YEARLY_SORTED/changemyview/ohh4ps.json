    "CMV: Being able to freeze time is the best superpower you could wish for\nI am convinced being able to freeze time is the best superpower you could have. I could fulfill all my dreams (both good and evil) with this power. \n\nIt’s important to mention that I’m talking about how a superpower would be useful while living a ‘normal’ life.  That means I’m not trying to be part of some Avengers group or fighting intergalactic demons. Let me give you some examples to explain. \n\nGet into a fight? Freeze time and escape or calmly find a way to defeat your opponent. \nWant to be rich? Freeze time and take whatever you want. \nStarting to rain? Freeze time and find a dry spot. \nRunning late for a meeting? Freeze time and get there on time. \nHave to answer a tough question? Take all the time you need to think about an answer.  \nWant to live life to the max? Freeze time every now and then to experience everything the world has to offer without having to rush things. \n\nNow, I’ve thought about immortality as a superpower. But the thought of being immortal seemed depressing to me because you’ll lose your loved ones over time. But by freezing time you can still grow old together, but on your time!\n\nI could even use this superpower to fulfill some evil and naughty desires… this superpower is better than invisibility ;). \n\nThe only limit I found with this super power is if you want to use it for helping people in unexpected disasters. Because you can’t act before it happens. It only works on easy stuff you are able to see in front of you. For instance, a child that is going to get hit by a bus or something. \n\nI’m curious if you can think of any other cons to this power. But I’m 99% sure this is the best choice.": [

Most bank systems are electronic, so getting into the proverbial vault would prove impossible without a keycode/password. Even if you somehow got a bag of 1M cash, what do you do with it? You can't just deposit it in a bank, can't buy a house or new car, can't pay a utility bill, etc. You would run into the same problems criminals do and you would need to step into a laundering scheme, since stopping time and running around won't make those problems go away.\n\nMind control? You just have the bank manager arrange a wire to your account. If you get any questions from any gov agent about it's source you just wave your hand and Jedi mind trick the problem away. Beyond riches, you could literally have any role in society you wanted just by telling people to put you there. You could have any lover, any friends, any possessions, go anywhere, and get the best medical treatment for any ailment (or task doctors to finding a cure if you need to).

Of course, it would be an active ability, meaning you'll only be able to see the probability of something happening and manipulate it when you want to do so, giving you the ability to prevent a situation instead of trying to solve one when it occurs. I'd also add the restriction of only being able to manipulate pre-existing possibilities, meaning you can't raise the chance of something happening from nonexistent to existing and vice versa, all you can do is raise or lower the chance of something that could likely happen. That way, you'd still retain a large part of your humanity without the chance _hue_ of experiencing the feeling of overwhelming superiority and control over fellow humans as you still follow most rules they follow as well, you can just \"see the strings\".",

You say you'd be able to fulfill your desires - and you might be able to fulfill the ones you have at the moment, but once you do, you'll want more challenging things, and ST just won't be able to do that much by itself.  \n\nWithout getting into the argument that a superpower that is composed of ST + something else is going to be objectively better than just ST, there are some limitation to what you can achieve just by ST. Beating someone in a fight is great, but what about healing that person's trauma so they don't bully others in the first place? How would you deal with solving political/social issues, even on a small, communal scale, not to mention global scale? What about if you want to accomplish something like building a complex technological structure (think a spaceship)? Sure, you can stop time, spend thousands of years learning the theory, then running around and doing all the individual tasks yourself, but chances are you'd despair before being able to complete it.  \n\nSo here's a superpower which I believe is going to be objectively better at achieving what you want now, plus anything that might come up in the future: \n \n**MIND CONTROL** (MC)\n\nThe ability to get other people do to what you want, how you want it, and most importantly, that they feel they're doing it because that's what they want themselves.

Get into a fight? Easy. Want to be rich? Easy. Starting to rain? A little harder, but don't worry, someone is going to bring you an umbrella and drive you to a dry spot. Running late for a meeting? Easy again.\n\nOn the other hand, the ceiling for MC is so much higher than ST. Stop wars and erradicate hunger tomorrow (or start WW3 if you're so inclined).

Additionally unlike other major powers time stop doesn't necessarily give you any potential secondary powers in the way super strength would give you an enhanced durability due to the necessary changes in your muscle structure and density.\nSo then if these major powers often require other secondary powers to work we must then move to a list of minor powers that would not require us to have additional powers in order to make them useable.

You mean freezing space time.\n\n- freeze time and particules of light stop moving: you’re blind. \n\n- no more température exchange so you’re left with your own energy to maintain your body temperature since energy from, say, the sun, is stopped.\n\nFrom point 1,2,3 you power will need such specifics as: everything that you minds projects needs to be un froze. Wanna breath, particles of air and light needs to move but only those you need. So it’s really no longer time/space freeze but rather freeze and the. Hyper-localized / selective unfreeze. \n\n- lastly regarding physics: take a photon, fastest thing in the universe, attach a label that says « stop » and shoot it in space towards an alien about to ask themselves if they should continue or stop doing what their doing. Freeze time. Go to that alien, un freeze time, tell them to continue walking and when the photon comes, it misses by a mile: you travelled faster than information itself could: you broke the universe in ways that will cause it to collapse.

For example, you're still going to age. the more you use the power, the faster you are going to age relative to everyone else, meaning that there is a bit of a hard limit right there. As others have said, if ONLY you are unaffected, how do you breathe? Is there an \"aura\" of non-time stop around you? How far? For example, depending on how far the aura is, you could only walk to get around. Depending on the size of the aura, I guess you could bike, but you couldn't use a car, so there goes a major form of transportation. So that limits the total range of how far you can go with time stopped due to, as I mentioned, the constant aging. sure, you could bike from L.A. to New York with time stopped and \"appear\" to have blinked there, but for you it'll have cost months of your life. \n\nWith time stopped, are liquids solid for you? Why would liquids be solid but gas not? \n\nYou wouldn't be able to use anything powered by electricity. Depending on the size of your aura, maybe you could use battery powered small objects, but anything plugged into a power grid? Forget about it. In our modern age, that's a lot of objects that are unusable for your time stopped state. That means that all electrically locked doors might as well be walls for you. Wouldn't be able to cook, wouldn't even be able to draw water or use a toilet. Idk if you could \"experience everything the world has to offer\" when you're severely limited in modern society. \n\nGoing back to the \"aura\" thing, would you have to consciously decide which molecules can act and which are stopped? That'd be a little overwhelming. If it's automatic, that could have some unforseen consequences. Let's say someone shoots you, and you're a bit slow on the draw and the bullet has already entered your \"aura\". Can't really be saved now. \n\nTeleportation via opening portals (like Nightcrawler or Jumper (the book)) is better for most of the cases you're describing, without needing to worry about aging because you can skip anything that deals with going from point A to point B.  \n\nGet in a fight? Bamf away, or into a better position, or to pick up a tool. Want to be rich? Bamf into a bank vault. Starting to rain? Bamf home. Running late? Bamf there. Want to experience the world? Bamf to anywhere in the world you want: no waiting in lines, no long plane/train/boat/car rides, no need for hotels. \n\nHell, you could live somewhere with an extremely low cost of living and just teleport to whereever you need to be. Need to move? Pick up a box, bamf exactly where it needs to go, set it down, repeat. \n\nHowever, as far as the best power goes, I'd argue that it's the ability to clone or duplicate yourself like Multiple Man. \n\nGet in a fight? Boom, there's 20 of you. Need money? You can create an entire workforce; the income of dozens or hundreds with the cost of living of 1. Running late? How are you late when you have other yous doing everything else you need to get done?  Want to experience everything the world has to offer? You can go anywhere or do anything while you got clones maintaining your day to day life and sending you the money. Who needs to stop time to learn or read when you could have clones reading every book in a library, reading every page on wikipedia, and taking every course in community college simultaneously, and just absorbing the clone?",

I get that you could say things you directly interact with will function normally, but in the case of the cell phone, it'll act like you have no service.\n\nIn addition, freezing time won't allow you to reverse time, so if you took too long to freeze it and a negative outcome is already starting to unfold, all you'll be able to do is force yourself to accept the inevitable consequences for a longer period of time.\n\nIf you're talking about the best superpower you could have for everyday purposes, I think nothing beats having access to the Developer console/godmode like in Minecraft.

Heck, make them give you a handjob and like it. Starting to rain? Make the nearest person sprint to you with an umbrella. Keep a squadron of people nearby for the sole purpose of carrying umbrellas. Running late for a meeting? Make every person at the meeting not care. Make them choose to never hold a meeting again. Make them sell the company and give you the money. Have to answer a tough question? Make the person asking no longer want to know, or make them think whatever you say is the best possible answer. Or mind control the 26,000 smartest people in the world come up with an answer. Want to live life to the max? Have everyone give you whatever you want. Free plane rides. Free countries. Sex with everyone you could ever want to have sex with. Have the entire world dedicate their time and energy toward space travel just so that you can see what it's like on the surface of Pluto. Or refocus the world's energy toward technological immortality, or toward teleportation, or whatever technology that's possible. Not only could you become immortal (if that's within the scope of technology, which I suspect it is), you could make everyone you care about immortal with you, or at least live as long as you want to live. Worried about climate change or wars or racism or whatever else? Make everyone stop doing shitty things. \n\nThe only potential downside is that in a world controlled by you, you'd get bored. Life would be so easy as to become empty and meaningless because it might feel like that point in a video game where you've beaten it and your character is overpowered. Fun for a little while but the triviality of everything makes you want to play a different game. So having mass mind control might take some self control. You can choose not to control everyone's actions all the time. You could set everyone an objective \"be nice to each other\" and let things play out as they may without your further interference. \n\nMass mind control is the best power.",

            "text": "This is probably one of the hardest superpowers to explain with the rules of physics. For example, if you do ANYTHING while time is frozen, if you even move the tiniest femtometer, you've exceeded the speed of causality and are now simultaneously in the same position you \"were\" and \"are\". those two words are in quotations because the idea of \"were\" and \"are\" can't exist because there is no \"past\" for there to be a past tense... Everything is always present. It just wouldn't make sense. That's why I would say \"freezing time\" probably isn't the best superpower.\n\nThe easiest way to rationalize it might be that instead of stopping time, you shift into a state of being able to function at the speed of light, or 99.999% of the speed of light. In that case, causality still exists so it's not quite as weird. However then you have to look at the implications of moving at the speed of light. Intuitively, I might want to say that moving your body at that speed would destroy it, but lets say part of your superpower is the ability of every organ and part of your body to function without breaking down at that speed.\n\nHow about interacting with other things? Does the amount of speed you're moving at necessarily equal force? I'm not a physicist so I need someone smarter than me to chime in. If you move your hand at the speed of light, you will be moving through the air and smashing air molecules aside at an incredible speed. Since the air molecules displace and replace at normal speed, to you, everywhere you move would leave behind a vacuum and probably a thunderclap from all the displacement of molecules.\n\nIt's just a generally really weird power. If you're not careful you could end up tied up in some weird quantum shit. Wouldn't recommend. The light speed one too, it just wouldn't work out. I think the simulation power someone else suggested is definitely a really good power, especially if you can run those simulations instantaneously.",

But if you can travel *backward* in time, you could always just go back in time to a point where the door was open.

            "text": "The issue with freezing time is that it’s just a pause/play button- there’s nothing bad about that it’s just so limited. Worse thing you could do would be to freeze time too long and it takes awhile to settle back ( kinda like Rick n Morty rules from that one episode) \n\nNow control over time is a complete game changer. You can choose not only when you die but you can also keep anyone you care about at whatever age they want for as long as you want! You can experience entirely different realities ( like what if the dinos survived ? Or there was never a meteor? ) you can even will things into existence simply by searching the timeline for a variation of events that causes that item to exist and simply pull it into your reality! You could reach throughout time and literally grab the Big Bang at the moment of existing and hold it frozen in your hands, and since it’s frozen by your will over time you can keep it from reacting with reality by just putting it in a pocket of null time ( after the end of time or something) \nOf course with time powers you risk a dragon break ( breaking time ) and that could materialize as literally anything ( in Elder scrolls a dragon break is when time breaks and all of time converges into itself. When it’s fixed everything that happened happened but didn’t? It’s weird stuff. ) \n\nNow IMO the best power ever where you **COULD** live a normal life is control over reality ( specifically matter as a whole ) you can’t mess with time but you could create a 1:1 scale replica of our universe ( including all biological or technological life forms and there exact chemical composition ) and put it wherever you want and use it as a playground. You control any aspect of physical reality, wanna scale a star down to fit in your hand and use it as a flashlight? Just don’t forget to negate the radiation and heat. Destroyed the universe by accident? Just make a new one. \nThe scope is as big or small as you want. You can make Dr Manhattan your Bitch if you wanted to, or you could just be some hippy traveling the world teleporting around to your heart’s content. You and anyone you choose could be immortal and witness all reality has to offer ( and can even make your own ) or you and your family simply live long, healthy,natural life’s and be free from the woes of cancer or diabetes. You could be *THE*avenger or the emperor of mankind from war hammer before he came out of the closet. \nI know if I had this power I’d rearrange my biological makeup to become that of a “ higher vampire “ from the Witcher and I would travel the world hunting down the killers and rapist of the world and put them in my “ space prison “ and visit the poor of the city’s and cure them of what ales them. Eventually I’ll live past the last of my generation and will only have myself and those whom I’ve amplified….. I would then start experimenting on my flock to try to give them control over basic matter and send them away to the farthest corners of reality to build there kingdoms or whatever they wish to do. After all reality would be boring if you had no peers. \nAnd the best part is you can’t break reality, sure you can destroy countless worlds and be an absolute monster…… but once you’ve figured out how to wipe someone from existence and then remake them from the ground up just as they where you can fix any mess you make. Why stop time when you can simply stop the whole of earth from being able to witness it’s passing? \nThe only issue would be human nature and hubris itself.",

Stop time for a year, and now you are a year older and everything else hasn't aged a second.\n\nYou also would need to constantly move around while freezing time. Presumably molecules leaving the edge of the bubble would become frozen in time. So the edge of your bubble would quickly start accumulating molecules - starving you of both oxygen and air pressure. I imagine that it would be pretty similar to being in space, up until the molecules fill the boundary between frozen and normal time-space and normal-time molecules bounce off the frozen-time molecules. Most of \"air\" is empty space tho, so quite a lot of air would get trapped before things stabilize.

Since I stopped reading comics years ago (and I can’t bother to dig through replies here), I’m not entirely certain what has transpired. So, forgive me if my hours-long post has already been addressed.\n\nThe most powerful superpower is that of the speedster (think The Flash)-because the ability to move faster than the speed of sound is the least interesting part of this ability. It is actually all the things which this ability requires in order to support it which are the real powers. Any object which travels at speeds indicated in comics will be encountering massive friction, thus heat, and necessitating huge energy to produce that speed. These cannot come from typical means: having metal skin (jet plane), huge fuel reserves (cargo ship), or aerodynamic shape (missile). Because this is packaged in a normal-appearing human body, that entity must have ways of defying many natural laws in physics. Those adaptations make the speedster nearly impervious and massively energy-efficient or -absorbing.\n\nThis is even before we get to the incredible amount of mental acuity necessary in order for an object to operate at these speeds. The speed at which impulses are propagated inside the nervous system must also approach breaking some sort of physical laws, else the speedster could never get past the first block in a city. This immensely improved mental and physiological power already means that the individual can out-think even the greatest “ordinary” geniuses purely on the fact they can spend 10 minutes real-time absorbing and studying material for what could be relative-time months and years. Being smart in the real world is based on effort and time-spent, if someone has an average intellect. Also, what telepath could interact with a speedster who is operating at faster-than-typical thought? Would it even be possible to train to think as fast as the speedster to reach them?\n\nAdditionally, they must be able to influence objects while speeding-otherwise things would just be exploding ALL THE TIME when they touched anything at super-speed. That energy transfer within the timeframe of the contact (microseconds or quicker) would impart so much heat/force, after all. With the ability to carry another living thing, this means they have to be able to extend their ability to encompass objects.\n\nSo far, we have at LEAST 5 separate super-powers wrapped up in the simplistic sounding “super-speed” power. It certainly isn’t on par with god-tier (reality-warping or magic), but I judge that is outside actual “superpowers “.",

Spent all night gaming and now it's 5 AM and you have work in the morning? Rewind to last night, still remember playing the game (or reading a book, or watching a movie), and then also get sleep. Suddenly realize you've wasted a month not really doing anything? Try it again. \n\nTake a week long vacation a dozen times over. Go back five years because that job you took really wasn't a good fit. Go back to college because you squandered it. Go back to high school. Go back to being nine, mindgame your way around bullies or your shitty stepdad or whatever, and just relax endlessly. \n\nObviously the major downside is going back and time past when you made friends (or had kids). I personally don't believe in fate or anything, and people can usually pick up on when you're trying to game them, or have a weirdly good understanding of their personality, so I don't think you could really remake those friendships (or have the same kids). On the other hand, this seems like the kind of thing where you'll eventually make peace with it and end up having lots of different kids, sort of like an immortal having a big family. Or not, maybe that seems horrific to you, but every power needs to have some kind of drawback. I feel like \"time powers\" that would let you somehow go forward in time, and back to your original timeline, are too much \"just be omnipotent.\" Rewinding seems specific enough to be a single power, where you still have to progress forward normally, and lose access to your previous \"future.\"",

Whether or not you get sick, your chances of recovering, the odds of winning a lottery, meeting your soulmate, etc. Basically if something is reliant on luck or odds, most likely it will happen (if positive). This takes the pressure of other superpowers like game saves, time rewind, or whatever off, if there’s any chance of your loved ones surviving a critical illness that chance will be actualized, plus it’s not like you control it really. All you control is whether or not someone is going to experience positive, or negative. Essentially like most feel good movies, but you can give away the main character treatment to everyone (in varying degrees). I’d give luck to all the good people in my life, they deserve it. \n\nOr, on the flip side, some really crappy people have amazing luck they don’t deserve, or you give someone luck and you need to take it away. You could probably use this like the death note, but I personally wouldn’t if I didn’t need to.\n\nIt also prevents you from fucking up your morales. There’s a lot of shitty things you can do with time stop, and I feel like a lot of super powers would detach you from humanity.

Your powers don't improve your reaction time, so any tragedy that \"happens\" before you see it is going to play out as-normal.  If you're at all interested in saving people, you're going to spend a lot of time with the dead or dying, people you thought you could save, but couldn't.  Or worse, you'll abandon them in their last moments because the combination of pain of perceived failure and pain of watching someone die is too much for you to bear.  And that's ignoring the people you actively -kill- through incompetence, which will inevitably be a total more than 0.\n\nAnd then let's wrap back around to the best things in life:  interacting with other people.

            "text": "I think you’re close to what I’ve thought about with regards to the best superpower because it also concerns time manipulation.\n\nThe problem with freezing time is that the only thing that doesn’t require much (if any) suspension of disbelief is the enhanced perception of time. This is because we don’t understand fully how perception works and you can imagine having time slowing down around you without any major physics laws broken. This would be good if you would need some extra time to think about stuff, or if you want some better than average reflexes at Valorant.\n\nThe problem with moving around while time is frozen is that you would need to overcome all of the particles that are around you. Imagine that you can slow down time around you so that one nanosecond takes for you what an hour would take for everyone else. \n\nIf you attempt to take a step, which would be to move your leg forward for about a foot, if this simple movement takes an hour for you to do, you would have moved a body part that weighs a few kgs with an average speed of 30cm per nanosecond. \n\nThat might seem innocuous, until you realize it is equivalent to a speed of 30 billion cm per second, or 300 million meters per second. This is slightly faster than the speed of light. \n\nIn this situation, not only you would require more than an unlimited amount of energy (if that even makes sense) to move something that has rest mass past the speed of light, but even if you limit yourself at something like 99.9999% of c, you would need to put out a tremendous amount of energy in order to achieve that. This would be enough energy to cause nuclear fission among regular atoms, which would cause a nuclear explosion almost immediately. See [this](https://what-if.xkcd.com/1/) for a good illustration of what would happen.\n\nThe bottom line when thinking about moving while time is frozen for everyone else would be that you’re pushing your muscles against your other meat and bones, against your clothes and against the surrounding air in order to displace them. If any of those fall out of the suspension of disbelief, you’re going to have some very unintended consequences. If you pick your nose in less than a millisecond, you’re probably going to cause a sonic boom.\n\nWhat I would suggest would be better, is to have this power, in combination with the power of rewinding time at will. Nothing fancy and paradoxal, just revert yourself (and the world) at a previous existing state, as far back as you wish (after you’re born), while preserving all of your knowledge, memory and muscle memory. Add a failsafe to automatically rewind a day or so if you lose memory of your powers for an extended period of time (because of dying, becoming unconscious or becoming amnesic). \n\nThose two powers would pretty much achieve whatever you are dreaming of.\n\nWant to be rich? Play the penny stock market, the crypto market and all the other possible high risk trades, never lose, and take everyone else’s money in no time. You probably want to do that while you’re young so you don’t have any reason to go back further in time and start from scratch again.\n\nWant to be rich and have some fun? Hit all the casinos and destroy most of the games with ease. Be the best poker player that ever lived without breaking a sweat.\n\nYou can experience life farther than anyone else can. You can have a 20 hour orgasm, a 50 hour high from any drug with little to no impact on everything else. You can experience any extreme event (slow motion perception comes in handy here) with no safety measures. You can have fancy cars and also drive them like in GTA irl with no consequences. Hell, you can throw yourself off of a skyscraper and rewind right before you touch the ground.\n\nIf you want to do some good in the world, there’s plenty of ways to do that. You can prevent countless accidents, terrorist attacks and other unforseen disasters by being captain foresight. \n\nThis power would also give you some sort of immortality without anyone you know dying: your experience will last forever, and there’s countless new people to meet, have relationships and start over. You can practically stay at any age forever without it mattering at all.\n\nThat’s the best superpower that I can think of. Time related, endlessly enjoyable and pretty powerful overall.\n\nNow, that I’ve tested this keyboard out, it’s time to go to r/bestof with an alt and repost this :D",

Across the park an agent speaks the codewords into the phone. \"Love you honey.\" As they lower the phone a shot rings out, but bullets travel faster than sound, and you die before you have a chance to freeze.\n\nWorst case:\n\nThe sensation hits you as you open the door, like a baseball hitting your leg, followed by pain. So much pain. You glance down. A harpoon, a *harpoon*, is in your leg.\n\n\"Go! Go! Go!\" Men storm from every room in your house. You freeze time. Turning around you see more coming up behind you. You take a step but collapse. Pulling, you yank the harpoon out of your leg. Blood begins to pour freely, splashing your doorstep with red.\n\n*Crawl.*\n\nThe though is your world as you pull yourself across your front yard. Every inch you feel yourself growing weaker. You've made it to the neighbor's yard, halfway across, pulling yourself as hard as you can when you collapse. You instinctively unfreeze time as blackness takes you.\n\nYou wake up. You are in a hospital room. Before you can get your bearing you hear a voice.\n\n\"I should explain that around your neck before you go running off.\"\n\nYou freeze time anyway. Your leg is in a cast, but you can hobble. That thought lasts all of a second as you try to move your arm and find it handcuffed to the bed. You learned how to pick handcuffs but this one uses a different key, and you don't have a paperclip anyway.\n\nYou unfreeze time.\n\n\"This will go much easier if you don't do that and just listen,\" the man says. He is wearing shades inside, dressed in an all black suit, short clipped hair. Everything about him screams government agent.\n\n\"That collar around your neck, the one surgically implanted into you, is a bomb. Two locations are tracking your gps constantly. They also get updates from us. One is buried under Naval Station Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The other is in the basement of a random house in the continuous forty eight. Both need to enter a keyword every five minutes or the bomb in your collar goes off. Now, let's discuss your...employment...to the US government.\"\n\nTL;DR Useful enough to catch government attention, not powerful enough to avoid being caught by the government, especially if used in the flagrant fashions presented in this post.",
