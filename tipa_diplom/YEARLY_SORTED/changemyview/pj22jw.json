    "CMV: Abortion is no different than pulling the plug on someone who is brain dead and both are okay\nHow is it that people can say abortion is immoral or murder when it is essentially the same concept as pulling the plug on someone who is brain dead? When you remove a fetus from a body it is not able to survive on its own the same way if you remove someone who is brain dead from life support their body will fail and they will die. It is commonly accepted that it is okay to kill someone who is brain dead by pulling the plug on their life support so why is it not okay to kill a fetus by removing it from the body?\n\nEDIT: while I have not been convinced that abortion is wrong and should be banned I will acknowledge that it is not the same as unplugging someone from life support due to the frequently brought up example of potential for future life. Awarding everyone who made that argument a delta would probably go against the delta rules so I did not. Thanks everyone who made civil comments on the topic.\n\nMY REPLIES ARE NOW OFF FOR THIS POST, argue amongst yourselves.": [

Let's say this brain dead person is actually in a coma for 9 months, and you still killed them. They weren't violating your bodily autonomy, and you just killed a man. This is why it's different from abortion.

Obviously, it's a different experience when you're the one who has to make that call to pull the plug on someone else who might be brain dead which makes it even more unfortunate if they didn't specify if they wanted the plug pulled or not. Likely, it would be a loved one, and if it's a child (your child, for example) then it may have been too early for them or for you to anticipate that problem so you can make that call in advance.\n\nThe difference aborting a fetus and pulling the plug on someone, even if they were only born a few hour prior, is that the latter has had the chance to experience life. I don't want to downplay either option, because in my opinion they are both incredibly tragic realities we face. In my mind, there is no moral difference between aborting a developing life in the womb or taking somebody off of their life support; BUT if that conversation is had where we discuss the possibility that they may not wake up, then potentially everybody will have been able to say their peace on the matter. The fetus does not get that voice. Best case scenario, it's at the mercy of its mother. \n\nIn the event a woman is given an unwanted child, even in the worst way, it's gut wrenching decision to make that call. When a loved has been severely injured and you're faced with the reality that they may never wake up, it's a gut wrenching decision to make that call. While we may tell ourselves that it's okay in the sense that there will be closure, that we will be able to move on from this, it's not okay to normalize and downplay the weight of those decisions. \n\nThat being said, when someone is pronounced brain dead, we are under the impression that their brain activity is done and nothing we can do will be able to bring it back. As the child develops in the womb, however, the brain is just starting to develop and brain activity can be detected almost as soon as the heart starts to beat.

Obviously killing babies is undesirable, but most of those children would not have decent lives if their parents were forced not to abort them, and many more are aborted because of severe abnormalities and disorders that would make life very unpleasant for them, as well as draining society's resources far more than ordinary children. \n\nHowever, this is a poor analogy. The reason we pull the plug on brain dead people is that there's little to no chance of them ever waking up. They are dead insofar as their conscious self is gone and will never return. Aborting a baby is putting a stop to a process that is all but certain to produce a conscious being within a specific, relatively short timeframe. The difference is potential. If we *need* to come up with an analogy because we can't make a convincing statement about abortion on its own merits, it's much more comparable to taking someone who is asleep or in a temporary coma with a specific time they are scheduled to wake up, ripping them limb from limb with a meat hook, and justifying it on the grounds that they weren't awake and (probably) didn't feel anything.\n\nAnd yes, I'm well aware that if the abortion is early enough, the nervous system and brain are virtually nonexistent. Not only does that not affect the argument except for whether the abortion in causes the baby pain, which is not really relevant to arguments over whether we should kill people. Abortion advocates also force pro lifers' hands to an extent when it comes to calling for an unequivocal abortion ban. Certainly there are lots of religious nuts in the pro life camp, but it's been made explicitly apparent that abortion rights activists, by and large, will not be satisfied until abortion is legal at any stage, or even partial birth in many cases. This would more than likely be bundled in with any major abortion legislation put forth by the left, despite the fact that we frankly don't know when a baby becomes \"conscious\" or even how to properly define the term.",
