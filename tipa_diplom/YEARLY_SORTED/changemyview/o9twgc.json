    "CMV: we should raise the minimum age to engage in sex work to 21.\nWhile I am perfectly fine with 18 being the age of consent in general, I think the minimum age to engage in the sex work economy (e.g., stripping, porn, etc.) should be 21. I know many people will say, \"well, like it or not, you're an adult at 18.\" But we've determined as a society, in the US at least, that some adults (i.e., those under 21) cannot consume alcohol or cannabis (and even tobacco now in many places); thus, we already have exceptions when it comes to liberties one enjoys at age 18. This isn't without precedent. And just so it's explicit, I think this should apply to all genders.\n\nI am making this argument for three main reasons. First, on a societal level, I think having 18 and 19 year olds in the sex work industry promotes ephebophilia in our culture (think about the popularity of the search term \"teen\" across many porn platforms...). Raising the age to 21 would at least reduce this widespread fantasy of someone \"fresh out of high school.\"\n\nThe second reason is that I think raising the minimum age of workers could help mitigate some of the coercion and predatory practices that can unfortunately co-occur in the industry (e.g., what was shown in Hot Girls Wanted). I think as people get older, especially after working a job or two, they tend to get a better sense of their self-worth, both as an individual and as a worker. Again, I know this would not eliminate bad actors in the industry, but I do think raising the average age of workers would act as a buffer to some of the more unsavory practices that can accompany sex work.\n\nFinally, and somewhat related to the point above, I honestly think many people are not mature enough to make a potentially life-altering career decision at such a young age as 18. Based on personal experience being acquainted with people who have done some form of sex work (mostly stripping) and interviews with some pornstars/escorts I have seen, it strikes me that some people are cut out for it and some people are simply not. And, sadly, I think it can lead to a lot of regret and pain if you get too deep into it before knowing you're not the type of person who can engage in the act of trading some sort of sexual service for money. Not to mention the fallout from doing (and later regretting) something like porn where there is a potentially permanent electronic record of your work. The short but developmentally critical transition period from adolescence to young adulthood (i.e., 18-21) should be about exploring your sexuality on your own personal terms before deciding you want to monetize and make a career of it for a while.\n\nI see that people may think this comes off as too paternalistic or sex-negative. Maybe it is, but again, we already do this in varying degrees in other domains in our society, so I'm not sure why this should be any different. I suppose you could change my view by presenting me some data to suggest that this would be impossible/ineffective or by enlightening me about some aspect or nuance of sex work that I'm ignoring or misunderstanding (insight from people who have worked in the industry would be especially welcome).\n\nChange my view.\n\nEdit 1: I see some some comments/replies essentially arguing we should move the bar of adulthood up to 21 for just about everything. While I do think there are some arguments to be made for this on case-by-case issues, such as military service (though that's a CMV for another time), I do not agree with this as a general rule. First of all, moving our \"age of adulthood\" to 21 all around would put us at a stark difference with the rest of the world, especially in regards to the labor market, which I think could have some disastrous consequences (e.g., decreased workers' rights, increased labor shortage, etc.). Second, and perhaps even more important, the 26th Amendment was passed, not that long ago, explicitly to grant suffrage to 18 year olds. I am strongly opposed to any proposal that would rob suffrage, intentionally or not, to any group of people.": [

Most people go into it having no idea what to expect, so they put up with a lot of bullshit they shouldn’t. I don’t think a difference in age of 3 years helps that.

If you don't want younger sex workers to be exploited, then fight against laws like FOSTA\\SESTA that stop sex workers from creating online spaces to support one another and allow them to share client blacklists. If you're worried about pedophilia in the industry, decriminalisation of sex work will allow for sex workers to report that stuff without fear of having their lives destroyed. If you think people should have an innocent time to explore their sexuality, then be a champion for sex positive education, LGBT rights and the destigmatisation of sex work.

Sex work is actually one of the least coercive ways this can be done because many forms of sex work can be done independently (camming). On the other hand, having a retail job or being a restaurant server not only pays less but also gets in the way of studying due to scheduling issues, which is at the control of a manager or boss.\n\nYour policy suggestion would only push vulnerable young people who want to pursue an education into the arms of the last institution that promises that they can give you a way to get out of college debt without restricting people aged 18-20: the US military. In the end, without addressing the underlying socioeconomic trends, your policy will force a lot of young people to kill and be killed before being thrown into a system that doesn't care for vets.",

            "text": "> But we've determined as a society, in the US at least, that some adults (i.e., those under 21) cannot consume alcohol or cannabis (and even tobacco now in many places); thus, we already have exceptions when it comes to liberties one enjoys at age 18. This isn't without precedent. And just so it's explicit, I think this should apply to all genders.\n\nwe have determined this wrongly in my estimation. there is no national age of consent in the united states but there are laws that make sex with someone under 12 illegal. states have taken up the task of determining the legal age of consent ranging from 16 to 18 with provisions for some as young as 14. in Mexico there are several places where It is legal to have sex with a woman as young as 12. in some places the line of consent is puberty.\n\nin my estimation, there should be no age of consent because age is a stupid arbitrary metric to determine whether a person can or cannot give consent. instead, I propose an i.q test and a puberty test.\n\nthe puberty test, done by a respected doctor, says whether the person has reached puberty and has certified that the woman is reasonably safe to have a child. the second metric, an i.q test determines whether the person is cognitively able to understand what the consequences of sex are and that they are able to handle those consequences responsibly. \n\nthat would mean that women who do not properly develop to have a child safely would be denied the ability to consent in any case as would be the case for men that never get their balls to drop or grow pubic hair. also, the mentally retarded people (an i.q lower than 80) who couldn't ever understand the consequences of sex or have the ability to raise a child would also be denied by society the ability to consent.\n\nboth the puberty standard and the i.q test should be valid for any other age-limited freedom like alcohol consumption. if we are honest with ourselves we must admit that we should have no power over what others do with their lives except when it is overwhelmingly clear and evidenced that the restrictions on personal freedom will in almost all cases make society significantly better. simply saying that it is not moral is not good enough and should never be acceptable. using other arbitrary standards as president is equally unacceptable. either it is a very reasonable, evidenced, and logical standard, or it should not be an acceptable standard.\n\ni am 1oo percent on board with anyone doing sex work who is mentally capable of understanding what they are doing and are mentally and physically able to take responsibility for their own lives. in some rare cases that could include people as young as 12. i do not accept the idea that it is immoral to do sex work when you are mentally and physically prepared.",

            "text": "Hi there! Posting as a woman who likes sex and posts on reddit just for fun. \n\nSeems like lots of people have a narrow view of what \"sex work\" is, and why people do it. I've seen comments about sex being like letting someone rent your body, and that's not necessarily the case. Some sex workers specifically get hired by virgins to teach them how to do it and help them through sex anxiety on their first time. Some are hired by individuals who have kinks that they haven't found a partner to indulge in and want to have judgement-free sex. Some sell panties, some dirty text, some make their own content, some work for production companies. Some make audio porn or write erotica. Some focus on sex education and teaching at sex-positive events. \n\nI think the bigger issue is that we've inherited such negative fear-based ideals about sex that are super outdated. Sex is one of the ways that adults are able to use imagination and play with one another, it feels good and releases endorphins, and masturbating and partner sex both feel great if done right. Rather than these \"what-if\" fears scaring everyone into thinking sex is a huge deal, I wish the conversation could be \"how can change society's negative, judgemental tone about sex?\" \n\nAs for ruining future employment chances, I don't think that's true. I think there may be more obstacles to get into the \"business professional\" world, but you can also just say \"I'm a consenting adult and I have sex\". Plus, depending on the type of work and the success of the performer, you can make like 10k an hour. Why would you wanna go back to boring suit and tie and no swearing and pretend to be business people life? \n\nAlso, I'm just musing and in relaxed mood. I don't like to fight, so please don't pick on me if you disagree. It's okay to think differently! 🙃",

By choosing to do porn, you are inherently locking yourself out of potential life paths that aren't obvious. For example - if you choose to become a porn star, there is a high likelihood you will never become a teacher. If your face gets out/the connection gets made, there are a great many parents that would refuse to let their child have you, the pubic would begin to question the specific educational institution, to a point where a school would never higher you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSimilarly, you are cancelling out a great deal of potential partners. People talk about being woke or that you should do what you want, but youd be surprised how quickly their faces would change when they realize their partner has done or is currently part of sex work.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n Whether it should have an impact or not, the stigma DOES have an impact on your future. OP I believe this is one of your general points.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy counter argument, I sorta guess, would be this - we begin to push it back because, as we say, 18 year olds are not ready to make this life altering decision. So you say to push it back to 21. But why do you choose 21? There is a lot of evidence that the human brain isn't fully developed until you are 25 years old [(source)](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/encyclopedia/content.aspx?ContentTypeID=1&ContentID=3051). While you would save some people from making this bad decision at 18, why just save them when you can save others by pushing it back to 25, since we know people haven't fully developed until that age?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn top of this, is it ever really fair to let people make this life altering decision that locks them out of life? Its very common for people to have a midlife crisis between 30 and 40. So much so that its a common talking point. What if my midlife crisis leads me to try porn, then because I am mentally unfit I get caught in that manipulative spiral that you mention in the sex work industry. My career gets ruined, I stop getting views other than the one so I get tossed out after since their is no long term contracts, and in general my life is significantly fucked.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNaturally, this doesn't necessarily counter your view point, and it would be a fallacy to make that claim. However, I do think its something to consider that if we are to put a limit or restrictions on sex work, we need to make sure that we put the limitations that would be the absolute best to help the problems at hand, rather than simply putting a band aid over the problem. Whether that's changing the initial set age as you claim, changing the economic model, or perhaps a government - run vetting and certification system to check for mental health, or specific courses for those considering and those running the industry, or a simple mandatory mental health survey or therapist discussions before participating in professional porn... All these could be potential fixes to some of the problems you've discussed in your post and should be considered as to what would actually fix the problems at hand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd of course, pushing the age back *might be* the easiest and most effective, so again, not necessarily contradicting it. Just trying to offer why your view may need some fine tuning if you will, and that we should choose the best most realistic options to help tackle the issue.",

Some people are in their mid 20s or later when they lose their virginity and are barely ready but some people lose it like at 14 and they're perfectly ready and understand the implications of sex. it's just very hard to say this is the age where people understand sex and all of its complex repercussions. \n\nRight now I think the laws are super dumb though because you can be in one region and 17 years and 355 days you're considered to be a child that can't consent and then the very next day you are considered to be a full adult and can marry a 70 year-old that is your choice.  And then these laws vary by region to region where some allow young teenagers to get married with parental consent and other weird law oddities.\n\nI think instead of relying on age to be the end-all-be-all factor for when someone is ready and able to dive into sex work or sex there should be a more nuanced test about their specific emotional maturity regarding the matter.  I think the pre-law student that decides they will go into stripping to pay the bills and understands what's that lifestyle will entail is perfectly entitled to do so. Or another person might need until they are 29 to feel ready to lose their virginity because they were a late bloomer that's fine too.",

            "text": "While I'm sympathetic to your desire to protect 18-21 year olds from predators, I think there are many tools for achieving a goal, and government is by far the most dangerous of them. Reaching for the government as the tool of choice for achieving that goal (or, indeed, most goals), is leading to some very serious problems already, in western society. The government is already entangled with science, education, the economy and the culture, and it's a hot mess.\n\nAnd that's just the beginning of it. What lies at the end of this road is tyranny. As power is concentrated more and more in a single place, there comes a point where there's no turning back. The people who created our Republic knew this, that's why they formulated such severe limits on what the government may be used for, as well as rules and principles it must follow.\n\nLet's take your suggestion, as an example. What you are suggesting is to have the government single out one industry, out of many, and limit it. That's problematic, in and of itself, because porn is not the only form of employment that requires an adult mind. 18-21 year olds also work in the military (where they are able to directly access incredibly powerful weaponry, and have closer access than the general population to the country's nuclear arsenal and classified information that can get people killed if shared with our enemies), they can work on oil rigs, tankers, critical infrastructure, they can be in charge of billion dollar companies, etc.\n\nSo even before we get into the particulars of the porn industry, making ANY single industry off limits to these people, while leaving the others on the table, seems difficult to argument sufficiently enough to pass the test as a legitimate government action which doesn't play favorites, doesn't endorse one person or groups beliefs over another's, etc. And, on top of that, tis not just any random industry, but one that's highly unpopular for religious and cultural reasons, and has been the victim of persecution from the government, historically. That persecution, in turn, resulted in this industry becoming very good at defending itself, and using the US Constitution as its tool for doing so.\n\nYour proposition would have a great deal of popular support if taken up by politicians. It would also be viewed with extreme suspicion by jurists, who are aware of the history of the above mentioned persecution, and the many precedents that have been set to protect the industry from further abuse. So, in my opinion, on top of it being another expansion of government power, inching us closer and closer to the point where that power becomes effectively unlimited, it would also be extremely difficult to get it past the federal judiciary. At least in its current form: if that judiciary falls further under political control in the future, and continues to be threatened with politically motivated investigations, calls for resignations, and \"packing the courts\", things may change. They might become too scared to stand up to popular political pushes like this one.\n\nHowever, if you are in any way concerned about the prospect of an out of control government resulting in full blown dictatorship, there are other tools at your disposal, besides sweeping federal legislation, to try and achieve the noble goal of protecting young women from predators in the porn industry. Some of them do involve the government, just in more targeted ways: there are lawsuits going on right now, against shady actors in porn, which question the validity of deceptive practices aimed at getting young women to sign contracts without fully understanding what's in them. These suits deserve attention and funding from well intentioned private actors, and are very likely to succeed, and land people out of business and possibly even in prison. And, of course, there are a million private options, which can inform potential victims, provide lifelines to the vulnerable, etc.",

            "text": "I want to challenge the view that sex work is bad or any more challenging/life altering as any other work which I believe is premise to your whole view. \n\nAt 18.. I was still in high school and college. I was certified in Sports Medicine and I worked in security as a bouncer. Many of my female friends worked in the sex industry(porn, stripping, escorting). \n\nDuring the same period of time, we all found out it wasn't for us. I didn't like medicine, and couldn't afford the education to pursue my masters and quit. They didn't like sex work and quit. \n\nWe both had the same hurdle to climb in our twenties, changing our careers and reputations. It took all of us years to change it. Ironically, the porn stars had the quickest recoveries as their careers are typically shorter then most strippers/escorts and they didn't have more Fame then the average escort does. Only I and other frequenters of her particular kind of sex work knew she ever did it in the first place. Nor have they developed debt in their pursuit. In most cases, their efforts funded life changes. \n\nAs a bouncer and security guard, I made substantially less money then they did. I could only increase my income through working longer hours and accepting bribes. Plus I was putting myself in danger, semi frequently engaging in fights and being shot at by criminals and bar attendants. I even experience sexual assualt from drunk bar attendants who struck out with patrons. I had a mountain of college debt that i afford, not even working 16 hours a day. My body begin to suffer from working night and swing shifts continually. I developed sleep issues I never recovered from. I developed eating habits that put massive amounts of weight on me. Eventually, I ended up in several legal situations which pushed me to quit security all together. \n\nIn their 30's all these previous sex workers have moved on successfully. I'm still recovering from the choices I made. College debt and changing fields, this time from security to law, is just as challenging as changing from sex work to any other kind of work. \n\nAt 6'5 and 300 lbs muscular, I still look like a bouncer. I'm still up at 5:00am this morning writing this because I still have sleep issues. I'm still going to school and getting into new debt to change careers just like my sex worker friends. I still attend therapy from the trauma I experienced in my field. \n\nSo when I see my sex worker friends in our 30s, our conversations go life this. \" Hey how are you doing____? Do you still work down at that club? No. What do you do now? Oh ok. That's cool.\"\n\nThat's the same for me or them. In short, or situation was similar and their decision no more damaging then my own. As an adult every decision we make has consequences that may be life altering. \n\nFurthermore, the limits and alcohol and tobacco are related to car accidents and prohibition. Being that when the country banned those things, people bootlegged them and caused lots of issues, so the country pushed to regulation instead. Less car accidents occurr as people are more mature, so the drinking age was pushed to 21 instead of 18. It's not because vices are ethically wrong but instead dangerous to those too immature to handle then with the consequences being life ending as opposed to altering. \n\nAs for porn creating an attraction to young adult women... I don't believe it does. I believe human nature does that. Masculinity is basically the attraction to women who can bear children. Men sense this through nubility, youthfulness and perky breast and buns. These are signals of health and men who can still produce children(most men until they are about 60) will have some attraction to nubile young women. Moralisticly, I would have a problem dating someone barely older then my daughter but if I had always held that view then my daughter would have never been born in the first place. So while I myself wouldn't consider myself attracted to \"teens\", I don't down men who are interested in fertile women. The porn industry knows this and capitilizes on it, they don't create it.",
