    "CMV: Mandatory documents, such as identification, should be free of charge.\nMost sovereign states require people within their border to own and carry some form of valid identification, by law. This evidently applies to their own citizens. However obtaining those documents generally has a cost. IMO such documents should always be free for a citizen. Lack of income should never make someone automatically illegal, nor complying with the law should have a non-income/asset based cost. Furthermore you should never be forced by law to buy a service; either you charge in the form of taxation (based on income, activity and/or assets), or you have it free. Forcing to buy goes against any logic of consumer choice, and should instead be done through a mandatory tax, or simply not exist.\n\n*Note: exception can be made for consular services, as those are essentially a favor the country of origin does to its expats. So long as they can have it free in their homeland and are allowed to return (there exists adhoc traveling documents for undocumented people). Leaving was a choice, after all.*\n\n*Note2: please don't just reply \"my country doesn't require you to have an ID/document therefore you are wrong\". A few countries are like that, of course, but it's not the point of this post. It's a more general case.*": [

It's still basically the same thing either way.  \n\nI think a nominal charge for public services can help reinforce that these things have value.

I think countries should have a universal, free ID for people who do not have / can't afford a Passport or a Driver's license. There should be a free option that is the golden standard (usually the driver's license is, and it is not free and should not be considered essential) is my point. I also agree that birth certificates and the likes (Social Insurance Number/card, Marriage certificate, Death certificate), should be free but I'd add a clause of \"how many per year\" or \"with justifiable reason\" because they cost money to make and people should not order them willy nilly. Usually the first one is free but we often need more than one later in life.
