    "CMV: There is no way to be a responsible cat owner while letting your cat free-roam outdoors.\nThis is an opinion I've had for a while and have tried to discuss with pro-outdoor cat people. I like to think most topics are nuanced (hence why I'm posting it here), but I really have a hard time seeing *any* nuance with this one. Here is my reasoning, and I'll try to outline what arguments I've heard that do not and probably won't convince me of anything:\n\n1. Cats a domesticated species. I hear people say they're \"half-wild\", \"less domesticated\", etc - but the type of cat that we as humans keep as a pet is literally a unique domesticated species. They depend on us for food, shelter, and healthcare. Ferals obviously exist, but their quality of life is poor comparatively.\n2. Going off of point 1, cats are not a naturalized species around the world. When allowed outdoors, they are an invasive species. Most wildlife around the world has not had the time to evolve in tandem with exposure to cats, and as such, cats continue to pose a huge threat to wildlife. In New Zealand, for example, [cats are responsible for extinction of 6 bird species and 70 other species of wildlife.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cats_in_New_Zealand) From a purely ecological standpoint, it's extremely irresponsible to allow an invasive predator to freely hunt where you live - especially considering they often hunt and kill for fun, even when well fed, and even when wearing collars with bells.\n3. Outdoor cats are exposed to countless threats. To name a few: dogs, other cats, raccoons, hawks, owls, skunks, foxes, cars, asshole humans, traps, rat poison, toxic plants, disease, etc. Even if your specific region doesn't have one or two random threats, there is nowhere people live that is free of threats to cats. As a pet owner, your responsibility is to provide a safe, healthy environment for them. Letting them free-roam lets them come in contact with any number of potential risks for injury, disease, and death.\n   1. Outdoor cats have a lower life expectancy than indoor cats.\n4. There are plenty of ways to provide your cat enrichment indoors and/or give them safe, supervised outdoor time (catios, leashed walking, etc) without compromising their health and wellbeing. I'm not advocating for \"keeping them locked in a house with nothing to do\" - I think cats need playtime and enrichment, but that people taking the easy way out by letting them roam is lazy and irresponsible for the above reasons.\n   1. Dogs also need enrichment and outdoor time, but for the most part, we don't let them free-roam neighborhoods and cities like we do cats.\n\nI think that many people have the idea that cats are low-input pets who need little to nothing from them, which perpetuates neglect and poor welfare for them. Instead of challenging these ideas, we keep just putting them outside in the name of their enjoyment.\n\nI should also add that this post isn't about barn cats - I am separately critical of them (as a farmer), but this is about pet cats.\n\nCMV? I know I laid out a lot here, but I am genuinely interested if there are reasons with merit out there.\n\n**EDIT**: To clarify a couple points: I'm specifically talking about *free roaming* outdoors, not about things where you let the cat on the porch for a few minutes and they don't go any further, supervised outdoor time, etc. I'm less compelled by arguments that nitpick at a particular risk (they're examples of an overarching issue), more interested in hearing reasons as to why it is *responsible* to let cats free-roam.\n\n**EDIT 2**: Thank you for all the replies! Unfortunately I honestly am still struggling to see any reason that has really led to a deeper changing of this view. There's a lot of replies here and I probably won't be able to respond to all of them, but I'm particularly interested in hearing reasoning as to why free-roaming in particular is *responsible*, as I think this would help expand my view.\n\n**EDIT 3 (PLEASE READ BEFORE COMMENTING):** Thanks again to everyone who has actually put in the effort to leaving a response - although I still don't think this has ended up changing my view, I do appreciate those of y'all that took the time to think and respond to this. This post received a much greater response than I ever expected and I have to say I will not get to everyone due to sheer number (1.6k comments currently! and thank you for the awards!) and repetition of many points. I encourage folks who are interested to read through replies, but please, if you *still*  want to leave a response - *keep it to an argument as to why it's responsible to let cats free roam.* This is the core idea that I hoped to have my view expanded on. I won't be responding if your comment is the same point a hundred others have mentioned - I'll try to read as many as I can, but there's so much activity that it's hard to keep up with.": [

Cats get both of these by exploring their environment and their surroundings.\n\nIt is not a simple creature that you need to \"keep in control\", if a cat wants outside and you never let it out, then it will run away at the first opportunity. \n\nAn outdoor cat does not depend on humans to survive, not in the slightest. It will find both food and shelter with or without you. That's a fair point about healthcare, and if your cat needs special treatment then obviously you need to keep a closer eye on them, but overall, cats take care of themselves. \n\nIf a cat yearns for the outdoors, forcing it to stay inside is (in my opinion) cruel and stupid, since all you will get out of it is a cat that wants nothing to do with you. You can try to entertain it indoors exclusively, but that will inevitably lead to it chewing through cords, and getting into things around the house that it shouldn't. \n\nYour whole argument seems to hinge on cats being subservient and trainable the way a dog is.

Realistically it's just not possible in all instances and for all cats. We tried to have these body straps leashes and the cat would hated it. Would just roll around and try to get it off. The catios are not great either. We got one build, and our cats always learned how to escape, would demolish the net. \n\nSo the solution is to just have the cat indoors right? It's sad, but necessary. Wrong, the cat would go on these days long tantrums when he would meow incessantly, would scratch furniture, destroy boots, piss all over blankets, sofa, corners. Honestly, it just wasn't possible for it to be indoors. It's either let it out, or get rid of it. Otherwise it's just torture for the cat.\n\nThere just aren't many viable options for cat to be indoors, if the cat decides it wants out. The best thing you can do is to make reasonable effort for it being safe. Make sure your neighborhood is friendly towards pets. Make sure your cat is chipped, and has ID collar. Make sure your cat is vaccinated, etc..",

The fact that cats can be easily domesticated and kept indoors isn't an argument that they *should* be kept indoors. It isn't a comment on what their quality of life is for indoors v outdoors, and isn't a comment on what *they* would find more enjoyable. \n\n2. While this is true in some areas (NZ and Oz are two perfect examples) it isn't true in others. And in many places, like the UK, cats have been present for so long that they should no longer be considered an invasive species. The damage to the ecosystem they cause is already accounted for and adapted to. They are a part of our ecosystem now. \n\n3. This is a fair and undeniable point that comes up often in this debate. You're right, even if you live in an area with far less predatory animals, there are always human dangers and other cats/dogs. But I think you should think about this point logically. Your argument is \"it is safer to be contained than have freedom, safer is better, so containment is better than freedom\".\n\nIn that case, you should advocate for the complete removal of all wildlife areas and the production of gigantic zoos. If the primary motivation is safety, all animals are safer in captivity than in the wild. Yet, most of us recognise that the wild is better for them regardless of the danger present.\n\nI'd also urge you to look at yourself. It is undoubtedly safer for you to stay in your room for the rest of your life (let's just pretend you're able to work from home) but would you actually do it? Would you sacrifice everything outside of your room, just to increase the odds of a lengthy life? Especially knowing this isn't even a guarantee, it's just tilting the odds in your favor?\n\n4. There are undoubtedly ways to entertain indoor cats and I totally agree that if you had a catio setup, and plenty of toys inside, that cat would probabky be very happy. But would it be *as* happy as being outside? Again, consider yourself. If you had a PS5, VR, any other indoor hobby you could ask for, and the ability to sit in your garden, would that really be enough for you, for the rest of your life? It certainly wouldn't for me.\n\nI actually agree that pet owners are obligated to provide safety, a loving environment, and happiness. But I think you are prioritising safety above all else, when I would prioritise happiness.\n\nI'm not saying you're wrong either, I'm saying they're different approaches. I don't think either one is objectively right, but I don't think either one is objectively wrong either.\n\nMy argument isn't that outdoors is better than indoors, it's that they are two different schools of thought and, provided the motivations behind them are kind, a person could be considered a responsible pet owner regardless which one they choose.\n\nTo clarify, I've had outdoor and indoor cats, and three outdoor cats currently.",

They start acting out and showing more “catty” behavior. \n\nThink about it like this- someone buys you and put you in a house and says, “you can’t leave, it’s best for you and your environment this way”.

You can’t feel the wind, talk to anyone new, explore, etc. Sure you’ll live forever since there is no wear and tear on your body, but is it a life worth living?\n\nYour argument about cats being an invasive species, though minor, is a sound one. Take a trip to India or any other developing country. There are wild cats all over the place in the cities. I think the damage has been done.

Is their quality of life lower than a cat with a responsible owner? Yes. Are they dependent on a responsible owner to survive? No.\n\nWhether or not a feral, stray, or otherwise ownerless cat has a lower quality of life, does not reflect on the quality of life of a cat with an attentive owner that allows them outside.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Going off of point 1, cats are not a naturalized species around the world.

Therefore it holds no weight against the potential for potential responsible cat owners that have outdoor cats in areas where cats are considered native or naturalized.\n\nFurther, the distinctions between native, naturalized, and invasive are mostly arbitrary, especially over a long period of time. Domesticated cats have been on New Zealand for over 250 years, at what point would you consider them naturalized? They have been in North America for \\~420 years. They have been in Europe for nearly 2,000 years. In terms of domestication as a whole, they have been around on the order of 10,000 years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Outdoor cats are exposed to countless threats.

Letting them free-roam lets them come in contact with any number of potential risks for injury, disease, and death. \n\nPresence of threats does not mean the owner is irresponsible. It would be irresponsible if they did not reasonably control for those threats. You could name any number of indoor threats as well (Dogs, other cats, asshole humans, poisons, toxic foods, etc). You said it yourself, there is **nowhere** free of threats. Sure, there are areas that are too threatening to allow a cat to roam freely outdoors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy your own argument in that quote, a responsible owner should allow their cat to only exist within a cage large enough to provide just enough room for exercise and other necessities (Litterbox, food/water).

I suspect that drastically lower lifespan numbers for \"outdoor\" cats are biased in that it includes data from stray/feral cats as \"outdoors,\" while this study seems to show that outdoors cats with responsible owners still have normal average lifespans.

If you keep it inside and it wants out all the time then.. sure.. you're 'responsible' but you also are keeping your cat prisoner. \n\nI'll address your points in order though:\n\n1. *Cats dont survive well on their own.*\n\nIn terms of medical care, maybe. That is the case for virtually any housebound pet (a longer lifespan due to interventional medicine). That doesn't, however, mean that cat's don't survive well on their own. That's just not true. I live in Canada where the winters are biting and cruel and we have a community of ultra healthy ferals that come hangout sometimes. They're wicked healthy and I live in the middle of nowhere so they aren't being taken care of. I've had barn cats that were mostly strays tossed on the side of the road that lived long healthy lives as free roamers, and some of them even had big ol barn cat families. \nCats still have their predatory instincts and a very high prey drive, the assumption that they can't live in the wild is just not true. The lifespan of a stray cat is smaller than a housecat simply due to interventional medicine, and the risk of being struck by a car, or taken by a coyote.\n\n2. *Cats are invasive*\n\nPut a bell on your cat. Done. Cats with bells announce themselves to birds and other prey. This is such a hilariously easy problem to deal with for a cat owner.\n\n3. *Outdoor cats are exposed to countless threats*\n\nSo are you when you go outside in the city. If you stayed home all day you'd be safe. When you go outside you run the risk of being mugged, hit by a car, struck by lightning, etc. It still sucks being inside all the time, doesn't it? Your cat thinks so too.\n\n4. *Catios and leash walking*\n\nYou ever tried to walk a cat on a leash? Maybe one in fifty cats will do it. Maybe. \n\nIn terms of the catio, see point 3. It's just an extension of your house. Unless you have a ginormous catio area then you aren't providing nearly enough space for your pet. \n\n5. *But dogs need exercise and we leash them*\n\nDogs are slave animals looking entirely to please the leader of their pack and even then, if you have a high energy dog like a border collie then you either have a massive yard (see. makes catio look like a large cardboard box) or you walk it constantly (also, not doable for most cats).",

When a cat leaves someones residence, be it in a neighborhood with a close proximity of houses, the owner of the animal is no longer in control of their animal's actions. What your cat does when it leaves your residence is out of your control. End of story. I understand feeding into your cats natural instinct and stimulating their mind but at what costs? Everyone else in the neighborhood?\n\nFor example. My wife and I have two rescue dogs. They've both been abused and have a tendency to be very anxious around strangers and other dogs. We both know this, we anticipate their actions, and we adjust accordingly. We don't put our dogs in a position were we don't have full control of them.  If ours dogs attack someone, attacks another animal, breaks or destroys property, that directly is the fault of us, the animals owners. If my dog is out front and walks into my neighbors yard and takes a huge shit the owner of the house would find me at fault. Not only is it my fault but its trashy. \n\nWhy is it that outdoor cat owners, more specifically in the city and in residential neighborhoods, don't see any problem with their cats using other peoples flower beds, mulch beds, and lawns for their own personal litter boxes. I have a specific mulch bed that seems like every cat in our neighbor uses as its own personal toilet. Add the numerous cat fights at 3am, dead birds, and cats that sit outside my windows and antagonize my dogs. People would lose their minds if they saw my dogs clawing and barking at their windows antagonizing their inside animals. \n\nI've literally had a neighbor yell at my dogs because her cat was in my backyard and my dogs treed her cat. I just don't understand certain individuals lack of personal responsibility. Would I be absolutely devastated if my dogs killed a cat in my backyard? Without a doubt, however, it wouldn't be my fault. If your cat is outside the bounds of your control and something happens to it I believe its directly the responsibility of the owner. Maybe I'm jaded by neighborhood cats but to me its a simple question of \"Am I being a responsible pet owner\". \n\nDisclaimer. My opinion is very focused on neighborhoods in cities.

My labradoodle Mochi is one if the laziest animals I’ve ever seen, but he still likes to go on walks around the neighborhood.  These outings aren’t just about exercise—they are scouting missions that involve thorough observation, interaction with other dogs, and the routine marking of territory.  When I take Mochi out on walks, he stops being a gluttonous hairball and temporarily becomes a purposeful agent.  This is the closest thing he has to a job, and his day is incomplete without that patrol around the neighborhood.\n\nIt would be outright irresponsible for me not to walk Mochi.  He *needs* these outings.  You’re right in that he shouldn’t go out unattended, but that’s because he’s a pack animal.  Dogs patrol their territory as part of a team made up of either people or other dogs.\n\nCats do not have this same mentality.  They arent driven to constantly stay with the pack in the way that dogs are.  Mochi would love it if I chilled with him all day, but my girlfriend’s cats would *hate* for me to constantly follow them around.\n\nNevertheless, I’ve noticed that cats have a similar drive to patrol their territory.  My gf’s cat Trixie would ask to be let out at least once a day to circle the house.  In her old age, Trixie stopped hunting as much, but she still needed to scope out the area around “her” house.  As with Mochi and his walks, this was her job, and her day was not complete without it.\n\nWithout a doubt, Trixie’s daily patrols were dangerous.  The area she lived in was full of coyotes, owls, etc..  Nevertheless, she derived fulfillment (or some cat equivalent of that feeling) from her outings and hunts.  That was the job given her by evolution, and she was cranky on the days she didn’t get to serve that purpose.\n\nTo paraphrase William Wallace from *Braveheart*: “Every cat dies.  Not every cat really lives.”  Patrolling and hunting are an integral part of a cat’s life, and stopping them completely from exercising freedom in pursuit of their that purpose is, IMO, irresponsible.  The thrill of hunting is self-actualization for cats.  I don’t believe that they should be given free reign to kill with reckless abandon, but I also think they should have some freedom to pursue the innate desires given them by evolution.",

This is [simply not true](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/advice/gardening-for-wildlife/animal-deterrents/cats-and-garden-birds/are-cats-causing-bird-declines) for where I live. TBH if I lived in an environment that would make it impossible to let my cat free roam, I wouldn't get a cat, because to me this sounds like your location simply doesn't support species appropriate conditions for house cats.\n\nI'm in the process of getting a cat. Let me tell you how borderline impossible it is in central Europe to adopt from a shelter if you cannot provide free range. Some will make you provide proof, let them visit, or even make you sign a contract to do so. Without free access (sometimes they will ask you to install a cat flap) they will only let you take care for very old and sick animals who have no great drive for movement and roaming no more or are simply incapable of doing so. This is the reality of a different culture of cat keeping that you seem entirely separated from. Here cats have been native for hundreds of years. Animal rights activists will tell you not to get a cat before recommending to keep them inside. From this point of view keeping indoor only cats is like keeping dogs caged all their life because you can't afford to spend the time with them.\n\nBut what's probably an even more important counter point: The danger of cats for bird populations is a dangerous and apologetic straw man. There is a species that is systematically competing with birds for [land use](https://www.rspb.org.uk/birds-and-wildlife/advice/how-you-can-help-birds/where-have-all-the-birds-gone/is-the-number-of-birds-in-decline/) and [resources](https://www.rspb.org.uk/our-work/conservation/conservation-and-sustainability/farming/near-you/farmland-bird-declines/) and is [threatening the ecosystem that surrounds them](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/major-causes-of-decline-in-wildlife-populations-worldwide.html). And it's not cats.",

            "text": "The primary issue is that you don't believe there are cats who cannot live a happy, healthy life indoors. I'm here to tell you that there are. On the whole, I agree with a lot of what you are saying, with the caveat that there are exceptions. Based on your comments, you are drawing from your own experience of having house trained two outdoor cats, and you are convinced that anyone could do it with any cat. But you are wrong. Here's how I know.\n\nMy beautiful, beloved long-haired tuxedo was born feral. When I met him his ear was tipped, letting me know he was already neutered. Normally I'd leave a TNR cat alone, but he was toppling trashcans on the street looking for food, so I started feeding him. He was terrified of me and all people. It took a long time, but with patient coaxing and treats we made friends, and eventually he started coming inside the house in the evening to eat. But when we tried to keep him inside, he got stressed to the point of panting and drooling. He would get in the windows and scratch the glass, tear down the curtains, and howl. I mean HOWL. I think he has some Maine Coon in him - he is big, vocal, and loud. The howling is constant and never-ending. My family tried, really tried to help him become an indoor cat. We were patient, we added enrichment - cat tree, toys, treat puzzles, etc. And he had zero interest in any of it. \n\nIn the daytime he would hide in the smallest, darkest quietest place he could find. He wouldn't come out for food, or treats or pets. In the evening he would come out, ears back and tail down, creep to the windows and start scratching again, tearing the curtains, howling. This went on for days, and it was hideous for everyone. He wouldn't eat, wouldn't use the litter boxes, he hissed at us, he got aggressive with our other cats. No one in the house could sleep with his howling and frantic tearing around to all of the windows trying to escape. After a while we decided that his quality of life was suffering to the point that it wasn't worth trying to keep him indoors. So we let him out. He stayed away for a while, but eventually I was able to win back his trust and he started coming back inside to eat.\n\nThis was almost 9 years ago. He's about 10 now, comes inside morning and evening to eat; sometimes when it's quiet he sticks around and sits with us for a while, but we always let him out when he tells us he's ready to go. We made a few more attempts over the years to train him to live indoors, but it was always the same and only makes him distrust us. He is 100% a different cat outside vs in. Outside he is confident, tail up and friendly, rubbing against my legs, trilling, begging for pets and stretching out on the walkway. If he's forced to stay inside he crouch walks, tail down, shies away from pets, runs and hides whenever anyone moves. We weighed the risks and decided we couldn't sacrifice his everyday quality of life in order to keep him safe but miserable. We live on a dead-end street with no through traffic. There aren't many dogs, and our area is urban/commercial enough that wild animals aren't a problem. He is microchipped, and he's on a wellness plan where I haul him to the vet for checkups twice a year plus an annual dental. He gets flea and heartworm prevention meds. We do force him inside in extreme cases like hurricanes. For these occasions we bought a dog kennel big enough for food, water, blankets and a litter box; we put him in the kennel and sequester him in a dark quiet room with towels laid over it to provide him a sense of security (and keep him from wrecking the house). He still howls.\n\nSo, do you think I am an irresponsible cat guardian? I love my cat dearly, and he is well-cared for. Yes, his lifespan could very well be shorter than our indoor cats. But for the sake of compassion, his life should be a happy one while he's living. I stand firm that this is the best decision for him.",

I live out in the country and we have indoor/outdoor cats that come and go as they please. We live on a pretty large property (40 acres) but the cats stay within the 3 or so acres closest to the house. They sleep inside at night if they want to and have a screened in porch, a treehouse, a garage, and a barn to curl up in safely when they’re outdoors. \n\nWe tried having indoor only cats because of the whole “indoor is safest!” movement and we do love our cats and want the best for them, but we kept having issues with mice and other small pests. Because we have so much wildlife living in the creek nearby, we can’t safely put out rat poison or traps. The usual predators that control the mice population don’t come near the house because of our dogs but our dogs aren’t really mousers because they’re big (biggest is 98 lb and the vet says he is healthy!) . We can’t keep the dogs indoors because they’re an essential part of keeping the coyotes and ne’er-do-wells away our house and my grandpa’s farm next door. Being out in the country where it would take the police 15-30 minutes to show up, the dogs also act as an advance warning security system and crime deterrent. We tried, but we just didn’t have any viable alternatives. \n\nSo we caved and we got indoor/outdoor cats again. They’re pets. We love them dearly and feed them Science Diet and take them to the vet annually and keep up to date on all their medical needs. They spend time lounging around the house and sleep wherever they want, usually on my parents’ bed. But they are also working cats that earn their keep, just like farm dogs are working dogs. \n\nIn our case, it is the most responsible option for us to have free-roaming indoor/outdoor cats because the alternatives are outright dangerous for everyone else. Our cats kill wildlife on our property, yes, but *that’s what they’re supposed to do*. We have a responsibility to keep ourselves, our visitors, our livestock, and my elderly grandparents safe on our property and in isolated, rural areas, that means pest control. Cats are the best way to accomplish that. \n\nI know a lot of people from the city probably think that’s horrifying because “Oh my god, the poor mice and rats and frogs and voles!!” but keeping a lid on the critter population prevents a ton of other problems. During the time we didn’t have an outdoor cat, we had serious damage to some electrical wires because the mice literally ate through the wire coatings. We could have had a house fire, but caught it early, thank God. We also were seeing more predators near the house, and every time our dogs go tearing off after a coyote, that’s a risk to them. We also saw a boom in the snake population that was genuinely unsafe. Cottonmouths aka water moccasins are native to the area and very venomous. We had a scary close call one afternoon while swimming in the lake. There was one swimming straight at my 5 year old cousin and then when my 12 year old brother yelled and threw a rock at it to distract it, it slithered onto land and went after him. My brother killed it at the last second when it was within striking distance, armed with only a rock, but was pretty upset about the whole thing. \n\nSo we got outdoor cats again.",

They had two cats that would roam outdoors and they came and went as they wished. They had water and food inside but most of the time during the warm months they would be gone for day or two at a time. \n\nThey were hunters. They killed more mice and rats then I care to think about. Our area was fairly clean but even the best kept places still have rodents. They would often leave presents at the door like “lol noobs! Don’t worry we got food for you”. To answer point by point your arguments I’ll follow along via your numbers:\n\n1) domesticated? Yes you could say that, but they were able to come and go as they pleased even during winter dead of night (though less frequently perhaps as prey became scarce). They were known throughout the neighborhood and left alone, always knowing how to get back. I’m pretty sure they had other places they slept as I didn’t see them for spans at a time. Even if they weren’t given food shelter and water they would’ve been fine. \n\n2) Sure they caught the occasional bird but mostly rodents (even skunks *yuck** on occasion, though I’m not sure how they avoided getting sprayed). They helped kill off an invasive species there was no concern the other way around. \n\n3) dogs are leashed and probably wouldn’t bother with them anyways as they were tough fast and agile. Not like there were any other species around to mess with them like foxes. As I said above they sometimes killed skunks but no other species were nearby and I never saw any other cats. I can’t speak for their age as they were a number of years old when we first moved in (2014) and my buddy who moved near that location a few months ago said they still patrol the streets. Cars might be an issue but the speed limit on the surrounding streets is 20-25 mph with the fastest main road/street being 35 (30-55 kph) so little worry of traffic. Also they’re smart, always staying on the sidewalk and fast (cats in general reaching speeds of 30 mph) bright orange (clearly visible) and familiar with the area. \n\n4) I agree cats need exercise and I think these cats had plenty to keep them busy. They preferred to roam. Even walking in holding the door they would brush me off like “go ahead I’m chilling” and would meow (if their kitty door was blocked by snow) to be let out. \n\nIn conclusion, I think these cats served a purpose, are completely safe, and rather than harm the environment, they kept a harmful nuisance in check. They never got sick/injured nor was it even possible to think so even during cold weather, chasing after potentially disease ridden rodents (lord knows how many bodies they stacked up over the years). I would say they were more akin to barn cats but faced with fewer dangers.",

I hear people say they're \"half-wild\", \"less domesticated\", etc - but the type of cat that we as humans keep as a pet is literally a unique domesticated species. They depend on us for food, shelter, and healthcare. Ferals obviously exist, but their quality of life is poor comparatively.\n\nDo you know who also needs food and healthcare? You. So you can enjoy nature, but your cat can't? How so? If by your own words, she needs the same things as you do. \n\n>Going off of point 1, cats are not a naturalized species around the world. When allowed outdoors, they are an invasive species. Most wildlife around the world has not had the time to evolve in tandem with exposure to cats, and as such, cats continue to pose a huge threat to wildlife. In New Zealand, for example, cats are responsible for extinction of 6 bird species and 70 other species of wildlife. From a purely ecological standpoint, it's extremely irresponsible to allow an invasive predator to freely hunt where you live - especially considering they often hunt and kill for fun, even when well fed, and even when wearing collars with bells.\n\nWhat if you are living in an area that doesn't have such species? \n\n>Outdoor cats are exposed to countless threats. To name a few: dogs, other cats, raccoons, hawks, owls, skunks, foxes, cars, asshole humans, traps, rat poison, toxic plants, disease, etc. Even if your specific region doesn't have one or two random threats, there is nowhere people live that is free of threats to cats. As a pet owner, your responsibility is to provide a safe, healthy environment for them. Letting them free-roam lets them come in contact with any number of potential risks for injury, disease, and death.\nOutdoor cats have a lower life expectancy than indoor cats.\n\nYou can also get hit by a car. Should yous stay in your home 24/7 and never go out because outside, there are more possibilities to get injured? Why double standards, again. \n\n> There are plenty of ways to provide your cat enrichment indoors and/or give them safe, supervised outdoor time (catios, leashed walking, etc) without compromising their health and wellbeing. I'm not advocating for \"keeping them locked in a house with nothing to do\" - I think cats need playtime and enrichment, but that people taking the easy way out by letting them roam is lazy and irresponsible for the above reasons.\nDogs also need enrichment and outdoor time, but for the most part, we don't let them free-roam neighborhoods and cities like we do cats.\n\nYou can also play video games 24/7. Don't go outside because a dog can bite your leg or something.\n\nIt seems that you are a very controlling person. You want your cat to literally be your fluffy toy and if someone disagrees, he or she is not a responsible pet owner. \n\nI find it a bit absurd. it's the same mentality as in very strict parents that don't let their kids... live their lives.",

            "text": "Children would be safer if we kept them at home all the time, but we don't because we recognise that they would not be leading full, satisfying, happy lives. I view the situation with cats in a pretty similar way.  Allowing cats to roam free outside does increase the risks they experience and reduce their life expectancy, but that is balanced against the fact that their quality of life, health, and happiness is dramatically increased during their life.  Cats by nature like to roam, explore, stalk prey, and hunt.  They are noticeably happier and healthier when allowed the freedom to roam outside and to behave in line with their natural behaviour and instincts.  If you object to a cat's natural behaviour, the responsible solution is to not have a cat.\n\nThere are situations where it is not safe to allow a cat outdoors, such as a blind cat, but keeping a cat without any access to the outside without a valid reason to do so is certainly more cruel and irresponsible than letting it roam free.  It is putting your own desire for a cat above the cat's needs for a stimulating, active, outdoor life.  Most cats need some type of outdoor access to be happy.  \n\nHaving said all of that, I don't allow my cat to roam free.  She is allowed in my courtyard when I am at home, but that is all. I've taken this decision based on her unique needs, because she does not have the health, character, or survival instincts necessary to roam.  The outdoor access she has in my yard is sufficient to meet her need to be outside whilst minimising the risk to her safety.  She sits on the wall, lazes in the sun, attacks my plants, and watches the birds.  Seeing how happy this limited outdoor access makes her has only reinforced my view that keeping cats indoors has a very detrimental impact on their happiness. She would be utterly miserable if she was always kept indoors and she is terrified of being walked around the neighbourhood on a lead.  She only feels safe in her little territorial bubble, with the freedom to run to her safe spaces if she feels there are any threats.  In addition to her outdoor time, she needs a significant amount of active play time indoors- generally up to an hour a day is necessary to avoid her becoming bored or restless.  I highly doubt that most non free roaming cats are given the daily outdoor access and extensive play time needed to keep them happy and stimulated, and I would argue that the owners of those cats are far more irresponsible than those who allow a cat to roam free.",

You also can't let them out at night. The only problem honestly I see with outside cats are ferals and strays (which yes are cause by irresponsible owners). They are the cats who really do damage to birds and local wildlife. They also recommend keeping your cat inside for a few weeks when moving houses so they don't run away. With following all of this my two cats have never run away, one of them has gotten sick once in the 5 years I've had them (from eating some old cat food that had fallen between a crack in my laundry), she recovered completely BTW.\n\nThey are scared of cars, so will run away if they hear an engine, when they do cross the road, they are listening out for cars, and because they have better hearing than me, actually notice the cars before I do. \n\nDuring the day I let them come and go as they please, some days they stay inside all day and some days they just sit in the yard. But they never go out of earshot so they always come when I call them.\n\nOnly one of my cats kills and she only kills rats (which I am thankful for) and she eats them almost whole, she leaves the face, tail and intestines, understandably lol.\n\nThey come inside in the evenings when I call them. Often I don't even have to call them, because like I said, they are often in my yard or at my door asking to come in. They have their dinner, sleep inside, and leave when my boyfriend leaves for work in the morning. \n\nThere are stupid cats just like there are stupid people. There are dangerous cats just like there are dangerous people. There are cats who would run out in front of a car or stand in the middle of the road just like there are people who would do that! \n\nIts not hard to be a responsible cat owner and allow them their freedom. Think of how everyone's mental health has suffered having to stay in their houses during covid, now imagine its your entire life. Its in cats nature to want to go outside, just like it's human nature as well. It just depends on the cat as to how much staying inside would truly affect them, but I find it very sad to keep them inside forever.",

It was based on a US study or studies with a massive margin of error, and not based on the NZ environment, nor varied for eg different terrain/ predators. A cat on the Routeburn track could be massively damaging to bird life. The cats I’ve had/known in suburban Auckland have occasionally killed birds, yes, but have killed many times more rodents than birds. At what point does that become a win for the birds population?\n3) We could probably give you a longer life expectancy by locking you up in a secure environment. Y’in? Quality of life and the ability to express natural behaviors such as exploring, roaming, climbing and lying belly up in the sun are important to most breeds of cat. Being a responsible pet owner means being aware of harm your pet may cause, yes, and also means looking after your pet’s well-being, including the freedom to express natural behaviors such as roaming, and to enjoy life. \n4) as per 3\n\nIt seems like you’re coming from a logical point of view, born partly from frustration at the immense harm cats can cause (and at times are assumed to cause where the research has not been done). We tend to favor those we love, and those of us who cats will struggle with the idea of making them suffer (which most cats would) by keeping them inside, or giving up someone we live to protect birds we don’t know. But given you seem more likely to be swayed by the logical, I think the points you might be interested in are that\nA) as far as I’m aware the research needed into harm caused by pet cats various areas had but been done in NZ, and\nB) based on my personal experience, there’s a likelihood that pet cats in densely populated areas are likely to be helping bird life by hunting bird predators more than they are to be harming it.",

Those cats have crazy different personalities but one cat just refused to stay indoors once they discovered the outside world. \n\nThe orange tabby is a plump fluff ball and the literal definition of \"scaredy cat\". He refuses to venture more than a few steps outside the front door and may occasionally lounge on her closed upper deck unless he sees a bird or butterfly or something that sends him running to the sliding doors and begging to be let back in. \n\nAll he wants to do is basically sleep in a nook or on someone's warm lap, eat and get scritches all day. He's not usually interested in much unless it's snuggles or food related. He will also tolerate the most annoying toddler for hours probably because he loves the attention or is too lazy to move. \n\nHis brother on the other hand,  is a sleek black kitty that walks around like a regal tiger.  Every move is calculated and he is always looking,  investigating, sniffing etc.  Ever since he was a tiny little thing,  he would not tolerate being confined in any area. He demanded freedom,  and always learned where the exit was (even how to open one of the doors)  so he could venture out and explore more of his environment until he had access to the whole house. He would watch everything from the window and the first time he escaped the house one morning he ran into the bushes and disappeared for an entire day. He came back at dinner time with some cobwebs on his whiskers and dried leaf clippings stuck to his belly.\n\nFrom then on he refused to stay indoors.  Crying/ scratching at the door, demanding to be let out.  One day he jumped from the second story deck to his freedom so he could chase a chipmunk.  Luckily he didn't break anything and my sister started letting him out daily on her way to work to avoid further break out attempts and any serious injuries. \n\nHe's a senior kitty now and still spends almost every day outside (even in the rain, he'll sit under a car or bush until it lightens up) except very cold days when he'll ask to be let back in after a few minutes. He'll sit on my sister's lap before bed time and let her groom him and will affectionately nuzzle her with his head.  He will only grudgingly accept scratches from others if he deems you worthy enough and will not tolerate children for even a second (they get 1 warning hiss and then 1 warning swat before his claws come out - we tell all kids to give him space and go pet his brother lol) \n\nSo I guess my very long wall of text is to say,  animals have different personalities and some cats want to roam free outside and others want to stay indoors all day.

Cats are as invasive as humans by your definition (really they’re much less invasive by your definition).

Especially cats that have been outdoors before. They are also *a lot* smarter than you're giving them credit for. Just as there is nowhere you can live that human beings aren't threatened by multiple things we don't obsess over every time we leave the house, the same is true with cats. They are agile, intelligent, have instinctual reflexes, and the longer they spend outdoors, the more experience they retain from utilizing their natural skills.\n\nCats, like most predators, are not helpless. [There is ample evidence](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/domesticated-cats-dna-genetics-pets-science) that cats domesticated themselves to be around humans more than humans domesticated cats. Unlike dogs, they remained largely unchanged for thousands of years. And make no mistake, cats have *always* been predators. Hunting is instinctual to cats. Outdoors, they can freely express instinctive behaviors that they can't indoors. Outside, they can hunt, sun bathe, exercise, \"protect\" the home from threats, and retain their independent nature. When we say they're \"half wild,\" compared to dogs, they literally are. This is why it's an important distinction to make when thinking about their domestication. As stated above, cats domesticated themselves to be around humans *more* than humans have ever domesticated cats. They retain more of their ancient nature than dogs, so you can't treat the domestication of the two animals the same way, because they aren't the same. \n\nAnecdotally, I have a 15 year old indoor/outdoor cat. She spends about half her time outdoors either on my property or roaming the neighborhood. I have had her since she was a few weeks to a month old, and right from the beginning it would have been impossible to keep her strictly indoors. She wanted out so badly that she would *find* an opportunity. Even if it meant literally tricking me to look one way so that she could sneak past me in the open doorway. I also had dogs, and she learned to use the dog door to get out as well. Letting her explore the outdoors has proven detrimental to her wellbeing. Would it be better if I had defied and refused her instincts by keeping her inside when she was clearly unhappy with that? It's worth it to me to let my cat live a life that makes her happy even if it isn't as \"safe\" as keeping her locked indoors all the time.",

He followed me home (which was literally only about 70 feet) so I fed him. Over the next few days and weeks, he warmed up to me very quickly and was in my lap purring and rolling around. Within half a year, he finally started coming in through my window because he spotted me from the neighbors' roof. If the little dude is ever in for too long, he will scream his head off and go berserk. If anyone opens the door at that point, he will torpedo himself out the door at the slightest opening, which is impossible for my 80-year-old father to stop. He clearly was raised as an at least partially outside cat, and so that is the way he is going to stay. For people like me who do not intend to get a cat and instead have the cat choose them on the street, we pretty much have next to no choice but to have an inside/outside or purely outside cat. We had to evacuate the fires last year in August, and when we brought Moose with us to stay in a toy hauler someone had for us, he screamed bloody fucking murder just being confined in it. It was a terrifying experience for him. He stays in with me for many hours some days, but he always ends up wanting out. We think he was abused in the past by previous owners and was dumped off some years ago, but we are not certain. I do not have much of an option to make him into an inside cat, bro. I just do not see that happening.\n\nThere are also people who live certain types of lifestyles that would love to save the life of a little cat. Some people want shop cats and some firehouses end up getting firehouse cats. It is not feasible to always keep a door shut in these cases, and they are still saving a cat from being put down. The cat is at a higher risk of death, yes, but it is still safe from the needle and has an extremely good chance at a happy life. \n\nI worry about my little Moosie every single day that he is out and about.

She was a 2 yr old rescue cat when I got her and she just had a serious love for the outdoors. Like I could not tell you. It's insane. And she just had soooo much energy. She loves it so much. We lived in a cat-friendly neighborhood too. We would let her out day and night. It was a cul de sac neighborhood where everyone let their cats out and people were mindful of that. Away from the roads. Only big birds in the neighborhood (ravens, crows, magpies), no low hanging trees/bushes. I trained her to be responsive to this bell, so each time I rang it she always came running.\n\nWhen we moved we decided to transition her to a mainly indoor cat. In addition to agreeing with all the points you made (especially about how indoor cats live longer) the new place we lived in was just not preferred for having a cat be outdoor, unaccompanied.\n\nIn addition to having a huge, diverse bird population with low bushes...there is a ton of other wildlife. Hawks and owls that I have no doubt would be happy to snatch her up (she is a very tiny kitty). As well as coyotes that roam the area. She transitioned well to being more indoors. She is getting older and I realize she isn't quite the young wild kitty she once was so she is content with spending her days sleeping. But, I do still take her on accompanied walks. We adopted our rescue dog when we moved in. He was 6 years old and they bonded like crazy. I trained her to go on walks with us...she honestly is super easy to train with sounds and a clicker w. some treats. She really responds well so it didn't take her long to learn. She always follows and stays by our side.

(threats you mentioned in your post such as cars, wild animals, next door neighbor's pit bull, etc)\n- Is it ethical to let a domesticated animal hunt wildlife, especially in areas with endangered wildlife.\n- Is it safe to allow a cat to bring outdoor contaminants into your house (including, possibly, diseases such as rabies).\n- Is it ethical to allow your animal to roam outdoors when many others living in proximity to you also own cats and allow them to roam outdoors, effectively contributing to the formation of an army of pest and bird hunters.\n- Is it acceptable to allow any of the above when you could have raised the cat indoors?\n\nI think the real answer is that it isn't necessarily bad or good to do so unless you carefully weigh all the impacts. \n\nI would argue that allowing the cat to freely explore the environment is a right given to it simply for being a living, sentient creature, and if it has the desire then it has the right to explore and examine danger and possibly be killed. Although, because it is effectively a human-introduced alteration of the environment, that means it simultaneously ***does not have*** the right to disrupt the balance of wildlife. Combining these two ideas, that means it would only be ethical to allow a cat to wander through environments that it has little impact on. If it wants to hunt birds, it must only do so to birds that are in such number that it will not cause a seasonal decrease. That would be the only way to maximize the ethicality for all parties.\n\n(Keep in mind that humans are not stewards of wild life, we cannot tell the bears and moose what to kill and what to save. That is the law of nature. Introducing a cat in a place where it seamlessly fits into the ecosystem would not be an unethical alteration of it, in my mind.)\n\nThen the question becomes, is it ethical to have an outdoor cat in my location, or your location? I would argue, very likely NOT. If you live in the city, your cat will likely be hunting the same species being over-hunted by other cats. Birds are an obvious victim of this phenomenon. This would likely be the case for just about everywhere except for the boonies.\n\nCats have historically been used to deal with some of humanities' worst enemies, such as rats. I think controlled use of cats to maintain pest populations in cities is OK, so long as it does not interfere with non-pest populations.\n\nTL;DR - It's probably not responsible to have outdoor cats where you live, but it could possibly be responsible in certain environments and under certain conditions.",

I spent the first few weeks catching him and bringing him back in, only to have him do it again the very next time any door was open. \n\nI finally thought about it and decided that the responsible thing to do was get him a break-away colland and to let him go outside while supervised. I made sure he knew the area and how to get home. I slowly let him wander further into the yard (1/3 acre fenced), and left him out slightly longer. \n\nIf I had continued to fight him, he might have escaped and gotten lost or hurt. Hell, some of the stunts he pull to get AROUND me to get outside could have caused him severe bodily harm. The slow introduction was safer for him. \n\nI feel like I was doing the responsible thing. Responsibility sometimes means weighing the options and choosing the best in a bad situation. \n\nThat said, I don't recommend letting your cat outdoors, but I also don't judge people who have to make that choice based on the needs of the cat.",

Your argument against Free Roaming has brought out the nuance of outdoor cats. It has been very enlightening hearing opinions from different countries/cultures. \nIt seems that the concept of \"free roam\" is muddled by opinions of animal happinessand differences in perspective. Folks are passionate about their pets! There is also this widespread idea that cats cannot be trained. You offer good insight to the realities of cat training. \n For those who benefit from free roaming cats perhaps they are not aware of the other impacts, or instead feel the benefits outweigh the risks. \nWhen phrased as \"There is no way to be a responsible ANIMAL owner while letting your  ANIMAL free-roam outdoors\", I believe the nuance falls away. I think many of your points would still hold, and it would remove some ambiguity that trends with the wild world of cat owners.",

They walk around and see which house they prefer to adopt as their own. Personally, over the years we've had 4 cats adopt us as their new family. Two of which were dropped off with a collar indent still very visible. Since we were feeding them, other ferals would come and we had extra food and water to share. \n\nYes even though my family is allergic to cats, our outdoor cats wouldn't even see the indoors as a place to stay. They'll walk in and around to meow at us, or to shelter during severe storms, then yowl and scratch at the door to go out. One cat had kittens indoors but was out as soon as she could (she's more familiar, so we're able to pick her up and get her shots/spay & neuter after this). But I loved our outdoor cats. Once they adopted us, they stayed on our property practically 24/7. Sometimes they'd go for walks (?) or adventure then come back home a couple hours or the next morning. But our home and our property was their home. One cat (already full grown when dropped off) didn't let us touch her at first, but slowly warmed up to us over the years; and I do mean years. She was with us for 8 years as an outdoor cat. She disappeared two years ago, she was getting really old :(\n\nI had a neighborhood who would trap and release the cats that she fed. So we did our best in caring for them. And I'm not ashamed to say that I'm a cat owner. I have outdoor cats. They stay on our lawn or in the shade from the trees. Sometimes they leave us treats (dead mice or lizards). All my cats get scratches and treats. Since I'm not longer as mobile as I once was, it's nearly impossible to bend down and touch them that way. I've trained two to jump up if they want me to pet them (they do, everyday,). And just like indoor cats, outdoor cats get lonely two. All of our cats have overlapped here at home. We try to have two cats at home so they aren't lonely. But that's not up to us, the cats decide if they want to adopt us and stay here. Throughout the years of having our permanent house cats, the ferals/abandoned cats come through and want to eat since they smell (or cat talking idk) food, so we have a bowl out for them. We're not able to get shots for every cat, nor would they let us do so. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm a responsible outdoor cat owner.",

Most cats who spend any amount of time \"free and outside\" will regularly try to get outside and spend time there. Not all do, but a great many.

They ask to be let out several times a day, and if they dont get let out they get upset. They really do enjoy being out.\n\nThey are vaccinated and fixed, and protected from fleas and ticks.

My cat is now 17, and while I understand that outdoor cats have shorter lifespans on average, I feel that in situations like this, it’s fair for cats to be let outside. I also know that this may be a unique situation.

They’re territorial and even the most adventurous ones won’t go so far away. They like to be home to sleep because they don’t feel safe to let their guard down outside. \n\nThey can spend days roaming around, but most of the times they’ll come back in a few hours.\n\nOnce a cat has experienced freedom, however, locking them will led to a very miserable existence. They’ll assume the newly discovered areas are part of their territory, and no amount of home entertainment will fill that void. This is when you discover a very loud side of those mostly silent creatures.\n\nThey’ll demand vehemently to walk around. They do not only meow persistently, but also scream like there are a thousand demons inside, often in very inappropriate times (they are nightly creatures after all). They won’t let your family or close neighbors sleep. They’ll also  purposefully piss on your bed and in your lap, destroy your furniture, and keep looking at you with those killer eyes. Fortunately, they aren’t big enough to kill you, because they would if they could.\n\nSo, if you live in a safe-enough area, and the neighborhood is generally pet-friendly, and there are other cats around anyway, letting them go and trusting they’ll come back is just the optimal solution. They can’t harm humans like big dogs can; generally avoid strangers or loud noises, and also bury their own shite.\n\nAbout the fact that it’s riskier, I can’t argue with that. It’s a trade-off. The average life of a indoor cat is just longer, because there are less risks inside. However, like others have pointed out, cats are generally very good on avoiding danger. Survivorship bias, I know, but in my case I’ve never lost an outdoor cat or have them severely injured.\n\nIronically, from all my cats it was an indoor one who died from a car accident. He lived inside the apartment his entire life. Got used to it. One day we went on vacations and let him with my mother-in-law, who lived in a house. He escaped to the street in front of the house and got hit by a car. He didn’t know what a car was, and wasn’t really afraid of it.\n\nTL;DR most cats will just happily stay inside; while a few of them are extremely adventurous and will live miserably if kept indoors.",

Where I live (UK) they aren't really invasive, I've only seen cats kill pests, and my own cat is incompetent of catching anything as it's a house cat who can only wander around the garden. Also most cats are very capable of caring for themselves while out, they aren't likely to put themselves in much danger (except cat fights, which are a lot rarer and less brutal than i thought)..

However, I recently acquired an outdoor cat myself. \n\nIn the city I live in, there is a large feral cat population. Mixed among these cats are some former strays that were likely dumped. When I moved into my current home, one of the community cats “adopted” me as his human. He was obviously previously someone’s cat, and not just a feral cat. I try to always keep him indoors during bad weather or if he has a scratch that is healing. He wears a breakaway reflective collar with tag and a light I turn in at night. But trying to keep him indoors, against his will, when he has obviously grown accustomed to outdoor life, just seems to stress him out immensely. In this situation, I think it’s ok to have an outdoor cat.\n\nIn contrast, I have some neighbors that have simply let their formerly indoor cats outside due to the cat community in our complex. It is my understanding that my neighbors did this as they had more kids themselves, for some reason. The cats have non breakaway collars and act as though they desire to be indoors (trying to get into others’ homes, being aggressive towards the feral cats, etc.). This type of outdoor cat is something I strongly disagree with. \n\nOverall, if possible, I feel it is best to keep an indoor cat...well indoors. But for feral cats, it’s best to practice TNR (trap, neuter, return) and provide basic food and shelter to limit their impact on the ecosystem. And in situations like my cat, it’s best to be responsible and make a safe but logical decision on a case by case basis. ☺️",

His hormones were wildly out of control. He dominated (and currently still dominates) everything and everyone around him. He used to aggressively attack us when he was hormonal. My daughter had scratches all over her legs, and I had to fend him off with some kicks when he was going after me (he was not yet 1yo at that point). I have feared for the dog’s life. \n\nOnce he was neutered, he aggressive behaviors lessened but did not disappear. Reluctantly, with great fear for his safety, we decided to allow him outside. We really felt like we didn’t have a choice. So, the beast goes out when the temperature is above freezing (we live in Alaska). Side note: He seems to have a coat that is different than a typical cat, which may be from his father (unknown breed). \n\nIn the end, we allow him outside because it helps lower his aggression and I believe firmly that it has helped keep our dog from being attacked more aggressively (he still batters the dog, sometimes right in front of us, randomly).",

The bells still work though, they would catch many more animals if they didn't have them and were able to properly stalk prey \n\nI think we do everything reasonable to reduce their impact without being forced to train them. Like not every one trains their dogs but you wouldn't call them bad owners, similarly pets are best trained when young so adopting a cat that's 2+ years old and trying to train would be a nightmare. \n\nYou also should consider why people get cats. I like them because their more independent, clean up after themselves, and require less maintenance so to say. If i had to take my cat on a walk everyday i can struggle to see the difference in just getting a dog for the same amount of effort.\n\nI agree that yes cats that have full outside access whenever they like with no collar/bell is irresponsible.

She was skittish, unfriendly, constantly wanted out, would pee everywhere if accidentally locked inside... she was terrible. We had to move her into my place which were apartments that didn’t allow outside cats. I was convinced it wouldn’t work. Over the next 6 months, she became a completely different cat. I did a lot to make inside interesting for her, including setting up a big bird feeding station near a window she likes to sit at. We have a handful of games she really likes to play, otherwise she’s just sleeping anyways. She is friendly, engaged, talkative, cuddly... it’s wild. I trained her on a harness to go for small walks but she would get too scared, sort of like how skittish she used to be. She prefers now to hang out on the porch when I’m outside to keep an eye on her. I let her outside but never where I am not within grabbing distance (she had a big hatred for other animals since being on those mean streets) We have that time and she’s pretty happy and satisfied. The first few days sucked because she wanted out so badly but with a lot of treats and bonding, she mostly just wants to lay on the carpet in the sun. People on this thread trying to tell me she’s not just the happiest thing ever since she’s stuck inside with me. She loves that I’ve been home to hang out since the pandemic.

It also has its own sensibilities, it learns what to do to accomplish what it wants and pushes boundaries if it doesn’t like them.  \n\nIf you’re allowing your cat outside when it wants, and not forcing it, you’re handing over responsibilities to the cat based on its sensibilities. This can be sensible for you to do so, if those responsibilities can be entrusted to it. But you can’t argue with the fact that it wants to, which leaves you, the guardian in charge of the life of another, in a position where you not only have control of its life, you are also using that control to get what you want. \n\nMorally, you already have an obligation to give as much freedom as you sensibly can.\n\nYou do this as pets and children grow because the ultimate goal is for them to have control over their own lives. It’s the most you can ever do for any living thing. \n\nA lot of times, it’s not always sensible to give away that responsibility. as their guardian, it is up to you to determine when and if best to hand over any responsibilities. \n\nTo withhold it forever is to have made the determination that they are not worthy of the responsibility, and you should have good reason for this as exercising this level of control over another should not be taken for granted, or lightly. \n\nSome reasons to consider it; \n\nCats are solo, den creatures, they instinctively seek out ideal vantage points and areas for hunting. They have a better sense of where they are and how far they’ve gone. They can find interest in simply climbing and looking at things because that’s part of being a cat. \n\nTheir instincts mesh well with being given the responsibility of knowing how to get home because one of the first things they’ll do is likely scout the whole area around it while dogs may just go off in some random direction on a smell. \n\nSo in the sense of being responsible for coming home when they need to, that one is pretty easy, maybe with a little bit of daytime training on a harness. \n\nTheir solo nature also gives them an edge on avoiding confrontations. They don’t care to find other living things to interact with directly, they are happy noticing at a distance and figuring it out over the long term, carefully. So long as there isn’t a lot of larger, faster predators around that use the environment as a food source, your cat is is probably fine being given the responsibility to “stay out of trouble”.\n\nThere’s all the vet stuff that can have the pregnancy and diseases bases covered however you decide. \n\nThen you have the other issues, human ones, (traffic, assholes, and assholes in traffic) that’s up to you to gauge, Its usually a good sign that it’s relatively safe if your neighbors let their cats free roam.",

            "text": "I think it depends on what type of cat you get, and what type of access you have in terms of outdoor accomadation. My family and I have always adopted cats. For the most part these cats are ones found in the wild somewhere and taken in. Cats like this for the most part long to be outside, even if they aren't \"feral\" (as in trusting and clearly must have come from somewhere but either ran away or have been around people) , regardless of how much attention you give them. They are also not particularly easy to train. Dangers do exist outside, I agree. In fact my family stopped letting our cats out after we figured that through an outdoor renovation we took our cats ability to hide from local predators. Ultimately though our cats both escaped, and unfortunately were eaten. :( When I moved to abroad I more or less had a cat forced on me after not giving a clear \"no\", since they knew I was a cat person. I didn't want to have a cat because my work life was to busy to give it attention, but since I was given much choice in the matter, I kept her, and after a while I trained her to be outside. She was nervous, and for the most part doesn't leave the fenced in garden area that we have. When I moved again to a bigger city in the same country, I knew I couldn't take here with me because she would go crazy being an in door cat in a small apartment, so I left her with my roommates at my old place. Similarly, my roommates sister adopted a cat, and keep her indoors. She tried her best to give her attention and train her to take walks, but ultimately she had to give the cat to her mom (who lives rurally) as the cat became increasing aggressive, and clearly unhappy. Most indoor cats I have seen are really unhealthy, even if the owner tries to entertain it, with one exception. If you want to have an indoor cat then I think it helps to have more than one, maybe even more than two (if they get along).  \n\n\nI think the problem is we can't talk to our pets, so we don't know what they value. Obviously we value that they live the longest time possible, and never have any injury, and can be our cuddle companions when we get home. But I don't think there is any evidence that pets think this far ahead. So we have to try expect the needs of our animals as they want them. Dogs are pack animals, and rely heavily on social structures, when they run away they often can't find their way back home so easily, and they are not particularly cautious and get into shit or situations they shouldn't; that is why they need more care. While I agree with you that cats are just as domesticated as dogs, I think they have a more independent personality. They aren't pack animals, they have territories that they like to explore, and expand. They are curious, but tend to be more cautious, unless they are pissed. So with that in mind I think there is a psychological consequences when we deny cats some free roaming time.  Some cats handle it better than others though. Like specialty breeds, they tend to be bred from cats that are more tame, even if they are a more energetic breed.  \n\n\nIn terms of ecological consequences. I think that depends on where you live, and I also think that people should only adopt cats to help reduce outdoor populations, but often times people want to buy kittens. I think buying cats, unless it is a hypo-allergenic breed, is an absolute atrocity.  \n\n\nSo ya I think people should think more about the needs of their future pet in terms of what makes them happy. If the cat can handle being indoor, and doesn't seem unhappy then I think that is ok, but I think it is selfish to get a pet and lock it up (this goes for dog owners who are gone most of the day too), just because we need a companion.",

On the other hand, we had a different cat who lived to be 14 before we started seeing her less and less and she developed stomach issues that she wouldn’t let us treat. These cats were previously stray barn cats before we took them in, and because of the lifestyle my family genuinely couldn’t provide enough entertainment/enrichment to the poor things if they were locked inside all day (we were out working 4am-6pm with minimal breaks usually).\n\nOn the other hand, I’m now living in an urban area and wouldn’t dream of letting my new kitten outside without supervision. I feel there’s more dangers here (cars, people, etc) and with him being so small and naive he’s got a higher chance of getting hurt.",

Unless if it is feral, friendly kitties that are comfortable around humans should be indoors unless supervised outside (leash, catio).\n\nIt is also worth to note that if an “outdoor” pet cat happens to be hanging around a feral colony, it is at risk of being killed if that colony is ever eliminated by the city. \n\nThe safest kitties are the ones that receive proper care and love INDOORS.",

My cats can go out whenever they want, (they are neutered) hovewer I live in a village with no fast roads nearby.\nI noticed that cats don't really like to stay home, they come in only for food and to sleep (in the winter, because when it is warm they prefer to sleep outside).\nMy door is always open for them and still they prefer to spend 90% of time outside. \nEven if they might die earlier than indoor cats, I can see how happy they are being let outside. They hunt a lot of mice, much more than birds -and there are many many birds in my garden still despite. \nAll of my cats are very relaxed, sociable, affectionate, they come to me when I call them by names just like a dog, and I noticed my friend's indoor cats are more neurotic and strange.  \nI think it is ok to keep a cat indoor if you keep them from a small cat and they never lived outside, but I think it is cruel to take a cat that lived outdoors and make him an indoor cat.",
