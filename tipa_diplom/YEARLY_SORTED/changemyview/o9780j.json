    "CMV: Uber is an unethical company, and should be avoided\n1. They severely undercut prices to put taxi companies out of business so that they can have a monopoly on the market, and eventually increase fares and cut wages for their employees \n2. They regularly oppose legislation that would force them to provide their full time drivers with health insurance and other essentials that come with full time jobs \n3. They underpay their employees \n\nBased on these 3 facts, Uber is an unethical company and goes beyond the pursuit to acquire customers, but this company is actively harming the livelihoods of employees that work with them and will eventually hurt customers as they gradually start to increase fares\n\nEdit: \n\nThanks everyone for the insight. \n\nI have given at least 2 deltas that poked serious holes in my premise. \n\n1. In many states/cities taxi drivers were also independent contractors just like Uber drivers and therefore not eligible for health insurance \n2. Taxi cabs were essentially government run monopolies, so while this may be better because at least the the money flows back to the government, it was still a monopoly which does not allow for health competition for smaller taxi players (until Uber came along). So in a sense I am glad that these rideshare companies disrupted this monopoly. \n3. There was a couple people who said that Uber actually did report a profit in recent years. I promised to give a delta if they can provide a source for this but I have not heard anything back yet.\n\nUnfortunately the following argument does not change my view: \"customer service experience in taxi cabs is worse than Uber\", \"are you really going to boycott everything, that's not feasible\", \"this is just how business works\". They either don't address what the main point of the CMV is or aren't relevant.\n\nI'm going to end it here, never expected this to blow up": [

This means that they are not employees of Uber. Because of this, Uber does not have to pay them a salary or hourly wage. Come to think of it, I actually understand why Uber opposes such legislation. For one, it signals excessive government regulation of private enterprise. More importantly, the extra money that Uber would have to pay drivers has to come from somewhere, and that likely means fare increases for riders, possibly to traditional taxi levels. \n\nPoint 3 -- They pay their employees exactly as much as their particular market will bear.

As other commenters have pointed out, they clearly don't have a monopoly and really, they can't. There are numerous other identical app-based ride-sharing services that it's simply ridiculous to claim that Uber has a monopoly. Plus, anyone can start up their own ride-sharing business with little to no overhead at all. Simply design an app which anyone with programming experience could do and get drivers to sign up. \n\n2: Any and all arguments to be made on how their drivers should be treated are all invalidated by one simple fact, it's an entirely voluntary position. No one forced them to be a ride-share driver, let alone an Uber driver specifically. It was an autonomous and free choice to use their own personal property in a deal with Uber that they agreed to. Why should Uber be forced to change their responsibilities to their drivers when all of their drivers are free to come and go as they please? If they're not happy, the drivers can leave. And if Uber truly is such an awful place, they'll be forced to either close their business or change their policies. Seeing as they haven't done that I'd say their drivers are doing alright. \n\nTry to put yourself in the shoes of Uber, at a much smaller scale. Let's say you have an idea to open a lemonade stand, only, you don't really want to do *all* the work yourself. So you find a person who is ready and willing to make and sell the lemonade at your stand for a cut of the profits. You provide the lemons, water, sugar, and cups, while they provide the labor. It's a perfectly reasonable scenario and one wherein both parties are aware of the terms and freely accepted them.\n\nNow here comes along the city council. They see that you have someone selling lemonade for you and they don't like how you're doing it. They want to force you to double his pay, and start covering his medical insurance. But you can't afford that! You'd have to raise the price of lemonade to such an exorbitant amount that nobody would buy it, you'd go out of business! Why is it fair for this uninvolved city councilman to renegotiate the terms of you and your employees arrangement when you both freely agreed to the terms beforehand? Simply put, it is not.",

Its direct corporate competition like Lyft is also unethical.\n\nHowever, I think you're implying that ridesharing in general is unethical and bad for both drivers and consumers, and I don't think that's true. The platform-and-contractors model is, at least in theory, genuinely better for everyone involved than the old centralized corporations model.\n\nThe reason it's better for the drivers is that if you work for a corporation, you necessarily must be being paid less than what your labor is making the corporation, or it wouldn't be making a profit on you and thus wouldn't hire you. With the old centralized model, there is no way around this: if the taxi company owns all the taxis, and the taxi company will inevitably exploit you, in order to drive a taxi you must allow yourself to be exploited. \n\nBut with the platform-and-contractors model, it's at least theoretically possible to be paid the full value of your labor. Uber makes sure this doesn't happen because it uses its absolute control over the central platform to dictate terms to all its drivers, but if the platform was also owned by the drivers they could set whatever fares they want and not worry about being underpaid, either absolutely or relative to what they're taking in.\n\nThe platform-and-contractors model is also better for the customers because it's just a better service. This should be pretty obvious to anyone who's ridden in both a rideshare and a traditional taxi: besides being accessible thru a nice convenient app instead of having to call over the phone, rideshare drivers are nicer, their cars are usually cleaner, they're often safer drivers, etc etc. Because people can rate you on the central platform, unlike with traditional taxi drivers there actually is some incentive to deliver good service.",

I will specifically focus on the health insurance bit. \n\nAs it stands in the US the issue with companies working to avoid giving benefits to their workers is widespread. Companies have been gaming the system to get as many hours out of each employee as possible without allowing them to break the line that would constitute paying them more than the minimum hourly rate required to retain them. This is a rule across a vast spectrum of industries and not at all related to Uber specifically, though they are absolutely doing it aggressively and have found a new pattern (gig economy). \n\nThis issue is one that has been festering for a while and stems largely from the short sighted motivation of shareholder profits versus long term economic prosperity. Uber does not need to generate profit in the traditional sense to make money for its shareholders. That is fundamentally a mindset that I think most do not understand. Shaving every dollar they can off their overhead – even if it long term erodes their product, or perhaps even the industry – is par for the course for this kind of business thinking. It largely originated in the 70s / 80s but has only grown more prevalent. \n\nNow that might seem evil to you and me but when you factor in that the average joe has their entire life savings in their 401k that likely benefits when Uber and other such companies do well there is some argument to be made that there is a positive trickle of wealth in the system. These companies might argue that said low skill workers are being given an opportunity to have a low stress income source that they can, should they desire, use to improve their station in life and seek better employment. Not sure I’d always agree with that but it is certainly true for many. \n\nSo, bringing it back to your points and specifically health insurance: Uber and other companies are playing the game as the rules dictate. Uber did not create the rules, that was done at the political level (though yes lobbying is a part of their business but again that should be made illegal at the political level). As long as we allow the game to be rigged in this way companies that are not taking advantage of every bit of access they have are not doing their best to maximize shareholder value (which is a violation of the board of directors responsibilities). \n\nThe OP should say something like: the multinational corporation system needs to be regulated locally, federally, and perhaps globally such that workers have a fair stake in negotiating reasonable outcomes for themselves, including health benefits, access to a living wage, career growth, etc. The issue is political not related to any one company and to be distracted by the actions of a single company means you will never focus the pressure on the right place: the law. It is attacking a symptom not the cause of the illness. \n\nA final note: the whole concept of employer health coverage is flawed and should be eradicated. A single payer system that provides a baseline of quality care is the best way if your goal is to provide good quality of life to your people. America’s system is built on creating wealth from every health transaction so inefficiency is actually purposeful. It is the goal. Think about that.",

If uber puts prices up then competition will arise and drive those prices back down. \n\n2) it’s not supposed to be full time work as has already been said. I think these type of jobs could have been a benefit but have been ruined by people using them for full time work. \n\nThey weren’t meant to be full time. They were never offering full time like essentials, they were meant for someone to decide they want to make a bit of money on the side and pick up some passengers or deliver some food etc.  I don’t think it’s unfair that Uber set up their business with the intent to never hire full time employees but then had to change because people decided to make being an Uber driver their job. \n\n3) again not meant to be full time, and they are clear about compensation up front.  It’s a persons choice if they want to be an Uber driver. \n\n\nMy personal experience as a consumer with Uber have been great.  My experiences with taxi companies have been overall ranging from ok to terrible. \n\nI’ve had drivers on New Year’s Eve driving under the speed limit to run up the meter. I recently needed to get a ride from somewhere out of the way, would have paid anything asked, I had taxi companies hang up on me or say they would call back and never did. Up till recently lots of them don’t have an app or easy online booking, and the costs are always a bit random. \n\nI think it’s sad that for some of the drivers in this industry Uber might mean their jobs are no longer secure or change to something different, but I think driving a taxi is now somewhat a job of the 90s, like working in a copy shop or a blockbuster, consumer demand has changed / is changing and those jobs need to adapt with it.",

            "text": "You are offering utilitarian arguments. I think that the issue is more fundamental than that. We can't just calculate every little detail, make an exact prediction of the future, and then set up rules to change that future. There are too many variables. What we need, to operate in the world, is principles. We need to rely on them to decide what's good and what's not. These principles should be derived using the scientific method, and based on empirical evidence. In this case, I think the most important principle is the law of supply and demand.\n\nOf course tactics like undercutting prices, and replacing employment with contractor type arrangements, are part of a free market. But the free market also has benefits, and, in the grand scheme of things, it tends to work out far better than a centrally planned market. So you have to take the bad with the good, because the alternative (central planning) is worse.\n\nAnd the free market is predictable: it functions according to a set of economic principles. The most important principle, the fundamental driving force behind prices in a free market, is the law of supply and demand. Undercutting is a tactic that can cheat the laws of economics temporarily, but it won't lead to a permanent monopoly in which a single company can dictate prices, and set them far away from their natural balance. The law of supply and demand is far more powerful than the tactic of undercutting prices.\n\nSo, in the long run, prices will NOT be driven towards zero by Uber, and neither will the wages of drivers. They will tend towards a balance, dictated by supply and demand. When supply exceeds demand, they will drop. When demand exceeds supply, they will rise. Eventually, a balance is found where the price is just right to allow both supply and demand to stabilize. What that means, more specifically, is that that everyone involved is able to participate in the arrangement in a SUSTAINABLE way. Drivers can make a living that matches their skill level, the engineers who design the system can be compensated to match their skill level, the entrepreneurs who start up companies which will compete with giants like Uber can be compensated in a way that makes up for the massive risks they take on, and, most importantly, a large number of customers can afford to use these services with regularity.\n\nWhenever central planners get involved and attempt to manipulate the economy to shift that balance away from where it naturally belongs, one of these participants in the economy is punished: the low skill laborer, the high-skill, low risk knowledge worker (be it an engineer or an executive), the high skill, high risk entrepreneur, or the consumer. And ALL those roles are an integral part of the whole. That's one of the main reasons why central planning fails: you discourage people from performing ANY of those roles, and the system becomes less functional. Uber, and companies like Uber, didn't just take customers away from existing cab companies: they also expanded the market, allowing many people who live in big cities to ditch their cars without it affecting their freedom to get around the city at will. They're not just replacing the cab companies, they're doing a much better job than the cab companies.",

No way I will do that even if it's illegal for me to refuse, find an idiot that will accept or go back home walking\" so you had to try multiple taxis before finding one that do accept to do his job (taxi is a regulated profession in France, so they can't refuse a client if this one pay the correct price and is not dead drunk / aggressive). Same going to the airport, instead of legal price, they were often forcing you to accept fixed prices twice as expensive as what it should have been.\n\nOnce Uber started, we saw nice drivers, respecting their clients, taking you everywhere for a correct price. Plus, travels were tracked so that you could see if a driver is taking a detour just to make you pay more. \n\nBased on these facts, Uber totally transformed the user experience from being an awful one to a great one. Just for that, as a customer, you should support Uber (and for example tip your driver if you feel Uber is not paying enough its contractors).",

And the goal is pretty noble if you think about it.\n\nThe difference there is that a taxi service you call for a taxi, and a taxi comes to pick you up and take you where you want to go - this is their business, that's what they do, that's how the drivers earn a living.\n\nUber was meant to be an app where you typed in that you needed to go from one point to another, and then people driving in the area could get notified, so if they happened to go in the same direction they could have someone to split the gas bill with... But there were not guarantees and it was not meant to be a way for the drivers to make money - it was meant to be a way for them to save on gas.\n\nNow cue unemployed people looking for any way to make money... Drive someone from A to B via Uber, overcharge a bit on gas and they can pocket a little profit - and suddenly it's functionally a taxi service even if it's neither intended to be one, structured to facilitate that or charging anywhere near what they would need to make it function as one.\n\nIronically Ubers noble dreams of reducing carbon emissions by encouraging ride sharing ended up tanking the prices on taxis to a point where regular use became affordable to people who would have otherwise walked, taken public transport or just skipped the trip altogether... And so they ended up putting *more* cars on the roads.\n\nThe really interesting thing about it is that everybody in that dynamic has good intentions, and everyone involved act in a rational manner given their situations... Its just that the motivations and incentives of the different situations overlap in a really unfortunate way.",

This is not an abnormal practice at all, it is just super easy for a massive corporate gigas like Amazon to do it because even though they lose a tiny bit of money over here in the short term, they are still making absolute tons of money in other places so it doesn’t actually hurt them. It is a fantastic strategy for maximizing profits in the long-term. \n\nTesla wasn’t profitable for a long time, now they are. Most companies are not profitable at first.

Isolating them out for this practice would be like standing by a landfill and yelling at a guy who tossed a straw wrapper on the ground. \n\nI would also argue that the nature of Uber and other ride share services like Lyft is fundamentally different enough from the way taxis work that it isn’t worth making the comparison anyway.

When the ride does show up, the app shows me what route I’ll be taking so I can verify I’m not being take for a ride (and yes, that is where the saying came from).\n\nTaxi services won’t pick the phone up half the time, won’t given you a accurate estimate of when the driver will show up, and lie about having capacity if you try to schedule a ride for a set time. The drivers often flake and pick up another fare leaving you hanging, take you as far out of the way as they think they can get away with, often mysteriously have “broken” credit card machines, and have zero incentive to keep their vehicles clean, not smoke, and not be a horrible human.\n\nIn both cases drivers are independant contractors, except taxi drivers also need to buy medallions that are in limited supply to make sure prices stay high no matter what, which makes them a cartel.\n\nIf taxis weren’t hot garbage on fire uber wouldn’t be eating their lunch. Uber also sucks, but they suck less in a lot of really important to consumer ways.",

            "text": "Companies and individuals need to adapt and innovate in order to survive. You're completely glossing over the core reasons that made Uber so successful. They invented a brand new business model, allowed regular people to earn some extra money as a side gig, and most importantly, created a very well made app that let you book a ride and told you exactly how much it will cost and how far/long it will take. The app took out all the guesswork and randomness and waiting that it used to take in order to get a cab. And the app knows where you are, so you don't even need to call some call center and tell the person your current address (and very often you don't even know exactly where you are or how to describe your location).\n\nYou had to deal with the app, instead of some unpredictable cranky human being who would try to fleece you if they sensed you were an out of towner, or spoke in some unintelligible accent, or just flat out said they're not interested in going where you want to go. And then you have to deal with a credit card machine that is down most of the time or doesn't work. Or the driver tells you half way into the journey that you need to pay cash as the machine is not working or some such. On top of it, most Uber rides are a lot cleaner than cabs that are either filthy or really beat up or always smell of stale cigarette smoke. Heck, i have had many cab drivers not even turn on the AC on a hot day because they want to save gas.\n\nOn top of this, Uber also innovated with bringing down prices significantly lower due to their \"uber pool\" notion. You put up with the minor inconvenience of the driver taking on additional passengers but you also saved a ton of money as a result.\n\nAnd the cab drivers had no incentive to change - they knew they were already cartelized - the cab medallions were closely guarded and not just given to anyone and were also expensive to purchase.",

It seemed more realistic when they were making a push for autonomous cars, but without that drivers can switch companies whenever, and in practice work for multiple simultaneously.\n\nIt has become a Silicon Valley fad to try and pump ridiculous amount of investor money into markets to try and get a Monopoly (partial credit goes to scumbag Peter Thiel's book for this).\n\nI always argued that Uber's strategy of pumping huge amounts of investor cash into ride subsidies amounted to a Ponzi Scheme: they are growing their user numbers to make it look like they are going to keep exponentially growing, so that they can raise exponentially more cash, so that they can use that to subsidize exponentially more rides, rinse repeat. For it not to be a Ponzi Scheme they need to be generating real value along the way, which I suppose they are (so it's not a true Ponzi--look to Bitcoin for that), but a significant portion of their growth is speculation on top of speculation.\n\nThis is no exception among VC-backed companies, the exception here is that their product is extremely fungible and so monopolizing it will be impossible IMO. In any case, the IPO is the final pyramid stage, so now they slowly transition into trying to be a real company.\n\n---\n\nI agree with your premise that Uber is an unethical company, but I think that's primarily because they have a shitty, unethical culture, evidenced by their [Greyball program](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html), history of [sexual harrassment](https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber), [allegations of fraud](https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/10/16127446/uber-travis-kalanick-benchmark-capital-lawsuit-fraud), and [countless other scandals and controversies](https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-company-scandals-and-controversies-2017-11#october-2018-saudi-murder-of-journalist-jamal-khashoggi-raises-questions-about-uber-funding-47)... in addition to the way they treat their employees--sorry I mean contractors.\n\nSo yeah, Uber is a dirty company, but the \"trying to seize a monopoly\" part applies to most VC-backed tech companies these days, and I think Uber (despite wanting their investors to believe it) is in no position to achieve that.",
