    "CMV: Most Americans who oppose a national healthcare system would quickly change their tune once they benefited from it.\nI used to think I was against a national healthcare system until after I got out of the army. Granted the VA isn't always great necessarily, but it feels *fantastic* to walk out of the hospital after an appointment without ever seeing a cash register when it would have cost me potentially thousands of dollars otherwise. It's something that I don't think just veterans should be able to experience. \n\nBoth [Canada](https://www.healthcare-now.org/blog/new-poll-shows-canadians-overwhelmingly-support-public-health-care/) and [the UK](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2018/03/07/591128836/u-k-hospitals-are-overburdened-but-the-british-love-their-universal-health-care) seem to overwhelmingly love their public healthcare. I dated a Canadian woman for two years who was probably more on the conservative side for Canada, and she could absolutely not understand how Americans allow ourselves to go broke paying for treatment. \n\nThe more wealthy opponents might continue to oppose it, because they can afford healthcare out of pocket if they need to. However, I'm referring to the middle class and under who simply cannot afford huge medical bills and yet continue to oppose a public system.\n\n***Edit: This took off very quickly and I'll reply as I can and eventually (likely) start awarding deltas.

If those are covered by national healthcare they will be covered by your own reshuffled wealth (-bureaucracies share). For large treatments which do not hit every one, but rather a small share of unlucky people there is far more of an argument to share the load by collecting people together in insurances to share the load of potential risk. (Say one of 100 gets really screwed, then 100 crafting a pact to carry the one of them through is the idea behind a reasonable insurance.) But there is no necessity to obligate everyone to join in on those agreements. (either it is reasonable, then people will do it, or it is not, and they won't; assuming people are dumb is IMO viable, unless you value democracy as a ruling principle)\n\nCaveats: say somebody lacks the money to join insurances he deems reasonable, then that can be easier changed by direct monetary transfers, as people will allocate money more efficiently according to their needs than the external observer.\n\nIncrease of efficiency due to bundeling of demand. This should be technically possible with and without mandatory insurances, however I do not know why that doesn't happen in the USA.\n\nI live in a country with mandatory health insurances, where costs of treatments remain unknown to large parts of the populace.

Most citizens don’t know the cost of maintaining highways so they say ok it’s from taxes, because we’ve developed a Stockholm syndrome that taxes are ‘good.’  It’s an archaic form of maintaining them however.  Even France highways are 90% private owned and are pay per use (toll).  This results not only in better maintained highways, which can charge tolls based on use, but it ends up costing less than paying via taxes.\n\nThe truth is, anyone who is gung-ho about taxes fails to realize at minimum 25% of federal taxes goes to wars and the government will overspend on every program that it makes and everything it purchases resulting in essentially throwing away 50% of tax revenue.  My first job out of college was a civilian contractor for the navy and the #1 thing you learn quick is the government doesn’t negotiate on price for anything which is demoralizing when it comes to you spending your own tax money on.

I was born and raised in Ontario which is the largest of the provincial healthcare systems.\n\nHaving grown up in the system I much prefer the more privatized system in the US. Even with the higher costs. There are several reasons for this. Some from personal experiences and others from political/economic reasons.\n\nI am an asthmatic, so wherever I go, I know with triage procedures I get in quicker because breathing issues are serious. But in some instances I had friends who went in needing stitches, or having broken bones and spent almost all day in the hospital waiting. Some ended up leaving and going to a private clinic for care. I was in the states visiting when I was younger and cut my finger in a wood shop.  I went to the hospital and was in and out in 2-3 hours total. From others experiences they would have spent all day before they were seen. \n\nThere is also a huge disparity when it comes to normal doctor visits, and specialists. When I moved to the US, got my health coverage and picked a doctor I had my appointment for that next week. I know in Canada, it can take months to get into a GP. This also goes for specialists. It often takes months upon months to get into any number of specialists. This is why many times Canadians will actually seek treatment in the US for cancer, along with higher survival outcomes.\n\nThis has also recently been seen with the Covid-19 vaccine. I know many states are offering vaccines even to Canadians who live there, and I know of several who have traveled to the US just to get the vaccine. \n\nOverall, can US healthcare be expensive. Yes it can, and I hope that true free-market solutions are implemented to decrease the cost of healthcare, because at the end of the day it is a service and no one should be compelled. If actual free-market principles were implemented then those in the medical field would have incentive to offer the best care at the best price possible. But even with the problems currently found in the US system, the higher positive outcomes and speed of service provide much better care than the Canadian system does. I have experience both and much prefer the US way. \n\nAny realistic discussion of the UK healthcare system would show the deep issues that are found in it, poor care because of system backups and so much demand. Government is not truly able to dictate what is needed. There is a reason why the US is the top place in the world for medical research and drug development. Again, are there some issues, yes.

            "text": "I think that you misunderstand what exactly is entailed in a national healthcare system like the ones you champion.  My wife is a type 1 diabetic and I have learned a lot about it and studied up on it quite a bit since we've been together.  There's a lot here that you don't see because you don't have this type of condition, but let me use one of the easiest examples, the NHS, to show you exactly how this system hurts the people that use it the most.\n\nLet's start with insulin - a big topic in the media and something that people in the US are up in arms about.  The problem with the championing of insulin is that in the US there are massive programs to help people who can't afford insulin.  It's not like it's some great conspiracy.  You can get Novolog and Humalog cheaper than most insurance plans offer by contacting the manufacturers directly.  People who die because they aren't injecting enough insulin aren't utilizing the systems in place to help them.  \n\nBut insulin isn't the only part of a type 1's life that exists.  Things like glucose testing and insulin injection play a large part.  To get the best outcomes for diabetic patients, they need 2 things - a continuous glucose monitor and an insulin pump.  In the UK, and most universal healthcare schemes, these are uncommon.  In the UK, for example, you are only allowed to get one if you can substantiate a need through uncontrolled blood sugar levels, and even then, they have a limited number per year they allow.  Even after that, there is a still a huge cost to the patient in terms of consumables required that they simply won't provide.\n\nSo the best means to treat type 1 diabetes is off the table for most people in a national healthcare system.  This effectively shortens the life of these people by many years, and causes many more to die from sudden drops or rises in blood sugars because they don't have the ability to monitor.\n\nBuy let's say that you can afford the costs that they don't cover, can show the need, and manage to get on the list for this year.  The options for pumps and monitors is extremely limited, again due to cost to them.  The newest and best options are right off the table.  For example, the Decom G6 is the best on the market right now and isn't available in the UK instead favoring the much less accurate and less frequent polling Freestyle Libre (and not even their most recent one at that).  Pumps suffer the same kind of limitations.\n\nThese same kinds of issues translate over into other fields of medicine.  Cancer patients don't get the same treatments and medications that people in the US do.  Because of the strain on the healthcare system, they routinely make things that are prescriptions in the US over the counter medications allowing people to purchase them without medical consultation, despite the dangers of self dosing.  It should also be noted, that while antibiotics in the UK aren't given over the counter and still require a doctors prescription, many countries in the world don't and it is fueling the resistance to antibiotics.\n\nSo while you might see a benefit from your more routine care helping you pay for the treatment, the people who need healthcare the most, the ones you want to champion for this cause, are the ones that are going to be hurt the most.",

The silver-lining of the pandemic has been that it exposed how clunky and outdated our healthcare tech is and it’s forced a tech resistance healthcare industry to begin rethinking their strategies, policies, and technology. They needed to become remote immediately, support lots of data, allow mobile & digital communication that doesn’t require you to call your doctors front desk phone or come in-person. The list goes on and on. \n\nI believe in the coming decade, there’s going to be a tech explosion in healthcare that’s going to show the beautiful power & creative problem solving that comes with a capitalistic system. There are problems being solved that you didn’t even know were possible. \n\nLike you never thought you needed a tv in your hand a decade ago, but now if you couldn’t watch videos on your phone, you’d get very upset. That’s the healthcare industry right now. They’re working with dinosaur tech. \n\nThe government is not capable of being anywhere near as effective nor efficient as entrepreneurs can be. The government has no competition nor incentive to provide the best healthcare, just good enough to keep people voting. \n\nPeople voting with their dollars is far faster than people voting in government officials. It gives way more people power over choosing what works best for them as an individual rather than what works “on average”. \n\nA nationalized insurance approach will slow down innovation in healthcare like no other. And a slow down in innovation hurts us consumers in the long run. \n\nHere’s where I would agree with you - I think for absolute life-savings services, have something socialized makes sense. But, emergency services are the most expensive option for helping people.\n\nBut the consumer needs to be making a lot more buying decisions and with that we need a lot more choices in the market.

It’s about people changing their tune.\n\nDisclaimer, any numbers I say are off the top of my head, I simply don’t have the time at the moment to get sources. I will be giving approximations or saying that there is a relatively high number. These are based off of numbers I’ve seen previously, but I do not remember fully.\n\nAlso, this first statement is a personal anecdote.\n\nI was brought up in a Republican household, with a quite Republican father. He is not far-right, and will listen to some reasoning, but not much. A socialized health care system is a big no no for him. Him and I both work in a fantastic union that gives amazing benefits. I frequently am surprised when I walk out of an office and don’t have to pay anything. He thinks we’d lose those benefits, when in reality, our union should push for higher wages since the buildings no longer have to pay for insurance.\n\nNow here’s the thing, my father is hugely opposed to welfare due to all the people “abusing” it. \n\nHe grew up on welfare. His family took advantage of a system he no longer agrees with due to (here’s one of those numbers I talked about) 3% or less of welfare users abusing the system. Of course Republican talking points puts the abuse as a bigger issue.\n\nA lot of the people who oppose a national healthcare system already oppose systems they have partaken in, or are currently using.\n\nA large amount (approximate) of people using systems like food stamps, welfare, Medicaid, are ones who vote R, are ones who call for it to stop. I mean look at r/leopardsatemyface. People cry about a policy decision by Trump was the exact opposite of what he promised, that it hurt them personally, but that they’d still vote.\n\nI guess the point boiled down into a TL;DR is that a large amount of people who oppose a national healthcare system, cannot admit that they were wrong.",

It broke some of my bones, shattered and dislocated my shoulder, and left me pretty bruised up. I did not have a good experience at the hospital. I had my clothes ripped up, spent 12 hours getting sent from room to room, high on morphine, and eventually was sent home instead of having my shoulder repaired because \"If you can walk, we'll have you come back to fix your shoulder. We'll give ya some drugs, and you'll be able to come back\" ...I couldn't walk. I tried to a few times, and was eventually given a wheel chair to wheel myself out. They didn't offer me a new change of clothes, I wasn't fed, and I was sent home injured. They didn't let me stay the night or anything. That was one of the most excruciating experiences ever. My wife had to buy me food, and I took a taxi home in nothing but my boxers. I then spent the next week in a morphine-induced haze. That was one hell of a week I never want to live through again. When I finally got my surgery, it was late by 8 hours. My doctor gave me a prescription for painkillers which gave me an allergic reaction, along with more opiates. It took me a good 6-8 hours to get an answer on what drug I can switch the one drug with. I was told by a nurse that the drug I suggested was wrong, only for the doc to say it's exactly what I should do. At some point my arm went kinda bluish/purple, and I freaked out. My paperwork told me to present myself at the Emergency right away, so I did. I spent 12 hours to be told by the doc there this is a kinda regular occurrence when you have shoulder surgery and are wearing a sling. He was glad I went but was appalled I wasn't told this.\n\nMy experience going through Canada's health care system like this has left me wanting a private option.

[LONG read warning](https://randomcriticalanalysis.com/why-conventional-wisdom-on-health-care-is-wrong-a-primer/). The argument boils down to a couple things, like the US being high cost in terms of labor, increased consumption due to public good, and high cost consumption in the US (i.e., we pay more in healthcare costs because we tend to pay for the most advanced surgeries, therapies, drugs, etc).\n\nSo, **assuming that's true**, why would americans be happy moving from a high cost, private healthcare system to a high cost, public healthcare system? Reviews of the VA system are... Not great. If every hospital experience were like that and it cost just as much as before, you'd have a lot of pissed off people. \n\nAs a side, anecdotal point, my stepmom is canadian and is a former nurse, current nursing executive. She has worked in both systems. Canada's system may have changed since she was there, but back when she and her (surgeon) ex-husband worked in the canadian system, there were all sorts of issues. One thing she likes to bitch about in particular is essentially a quota system. She said that her ex used to do only so many surgeries per year, and once he did that many, he wasn't allowed to do any more. So he would knock out his allotment by like May or June and then not have funding to do any more surgeries for the rest of the year. Patients would be waiting for surgeries on their hands and he wasn't allowed to operate. That seems problematic. Again, things may have changed since then, but she's not too high on the system, and it played a large part in them moving to the states.",

I am totally for massive reform and universal healthcare (single-payer really isn't a silver bullet though the multi-payer systems like in the Netherlands or Germany are a better fit), part of the reason I retired early was my frustration with progress on these issues, now I run a minifarm instead. The discourse around this issue ranges from maddening to insanity.\n\nBeyond simplifying a really complicated issue I think you are missing a giant point that Americans are not British or Canadian and don't consume in the same way.\n\n> to walk out of the hospital after an appointment without ever seeing a cash register when it would have cost me potentially thousands of dollars otherwise. \n\nWe can have this without adopting a Canadian or British style single-payer system. Co-pays are an extremely important component to retain to help manage healthcare demand (both Canadian & British systems have tried to figure out ways to add this to their PCP system) but you shouldn't face financial hardship when you seek medical treatment.\n\nACA already introduced some much needed limits on out of pocket expenses but we should do more, there is no reason we need to redesign the entire system to make this work we can just decide to set lower out of pocket limits.\n\n> Both Canada and the UK seem to overwhelmingly love their public healthcare.\n\nIts rare people are exposed to other systems to understand the differences and they tend to be the source of either national pride or national shame with very little in the middle. Ultimately public perception of the system is one of the least important aspects of how its designed, the health outcomes are what we should care about.\n\nHaving said that those who use the British & Canadian systems are normalized to the supply restrictions that allow those systems to function. It would be unlikely American consumers would accept similar restrictions. Getting access to a specialist physician in the UK is extremely difficult. Wait times for non-emergent MRI's in some Canadian provinces border on the absurd. Both systems offer far fewer services for retirees and have much less of a focus on end of life care. The point with this isn't that one way is worse than the other but rather you can't simply point at a different system and say use that because we don't consume healthcare in the same way. Reform must factor in these human factors so it doesn't fail, if the politicians who are voted out because people hate it as we tried to change consumption patterns too quickly no progress will be made.\n\nOur focus on retiree and end of life care is considered totally absurd in most countries but suggesting we should focus more on care for those who are not certain to die soon is politically untenable in the US. These are the types of conversations we need to be able to legitimately have for meaningful reform.\n\n> The more wealthy opponents might continue to oppose it, because they can afford healthcare out of pocket if they need to.\n\nBroad based transfer systems must be funded by broad based taxes. While the US income tax is lower than much of the world its also one of the most progressive income taxes in the world. The Nordic countries have some of the least progressive tax systems as they have large transfer systems to fund, its functionally impossible to fund a broad based transfer system unless most people are contributing to it.\n\nFor reference even if we could adopt a 100% income tax above $1m without seriously damaging the economy this would account for about a third of all healthcare expenditures.\n\nOpposition to reform comes from everywhere just with a different focus.\n\nEdit:\n\n> Granted the VA isn't always great necessarily\n\nThe VA is horrific, it should be a source of immense shame.",

Additionally there are many wealthy people who do not want to give up their healthcare because they know that if they are forced into a public system their quality of healthcare will almost certainly go down.  \n\nIf you already have a plan that yourself or your employer ponies up $40k+(or whatever a gold pack premium is) per year, you see doctors same day, you don't pay out of pocket, you get the best most expensive treatments, you get private rooms, you don't have to worry about little bullshits like the poors like in-network stuff.\n\nWhen we brought national healthcare into Canada, it didn't just happen overnight.  There was resistance here too, but luckily the medical establishment didnt possess the power to resist the needs of the country at that time.  There was in fact though a doctors strike.  Doctors stand to see a major reduction in income, and the United States is one of the last places left on earth where doctors can earn several hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.  Contrast that with the canadian system where doctors are restricted in what they can charge.\n\nA national system is supported by nearly 80% among the general public.  Its only opposed by those who stand to lose with the loss of a private system.  And I would assert that that group stands to lose more than they gain from a private system.  Regardless if that's true, it's likely that their identity is partially self defined by their allegiance to the private system, and will be willfully ignorant of any benefits that they do accrue inside a public system.",

We have a universal healthcare system that is used for most cases, including several low to mid tier surgeries and a couple high tier ones. Mostly you can expect broken bones, small lump extractions and similar things to come out free, and more complex surgeries usually get a substantial discount. Also, you can get whatever medicines the doctor prescribes for free, at least in most cases. Waits are a bit more complex, since \"common\" visits to the doctor usually have short waits (one week at most), but those waits become longer the more complex the matter becomes, up to several months in the most complex cases. This free healthcare is paid on your taxes, but it's almost always worth it. You can even go to the doctor if you feel something is not right and come home without spending anything. \n\nHowever, if you need to go to a doctor for something really urgent and the wait times in the public healthcare are too long for what you need (or you just don't want to wait), you can always go to a private hospital. They usually have much shorter wait times or none at all, but of course they cost quite a lot. People usually prefer public hospitals, but people with more money commonly use private hospitals too. He also have different companies that offer health insurance to get some discounts if you happen to need a private hospital or to a private clinic, in case hospitals don't cover what you need.\n\nSo basically this is how health goes in Spain, it has its problems, but it is one of those things that we don't usually complain about, and I think the possibility of choosing one system or another might have something to do with that.",

This translates in really high salaries for medical or other specialists (university careers are expensive too but a lot of students receive scholarships or high interest loans, anyway i humbly don't think they should receive that much), continous waste of resources medications expiring, overtime not controlled, \"medical societies\" and public licitations, etc, and a sustained lack of valoration for our system mixed with a lot of workers with low empathy for those who assist public centers..which are of course a sometimes violent and overreacting bunch..\n\nThe result: long waiting lists for surgeries and specialist attention (aggravated by COVID of course), low quality treatments, a lot of confrontation between the workers, etc..\n\nI really think the resources are not the issue, it's (as always) the human component of it all.

If you need an ambulance and live in a busy city, there often aren’t enough to meet the demand of people who need one, so they have a list and must prioritise who needs one more. In other words, you could be waiting around before an ambulance even becomes available.\n\nI’m glad people have access to free healthcare who couldn’t afford it otherwise but the actual QUALITY of care in the US is FAR superior. From start to finish: On average you wait less for an ambulance; wait times at hospitals are shorter; equipment is better/newer; better hospital rooms and above all - you guys have a lower death rate when it comes to treating illness.\n\nYou wouldn’t know what you had until you lost it. If you want to maintain the quality you currently have and also have it ‘free’ then you are going to have to be prepared to spend FAR more in taxes; just look at France. I don’t think the American people are ready for something like that. \n\nSo in short, I would rather have have universal healthcare, despite its current flaws, but your current system isn’t nearly as bad as you make it out to be. The best thing for the US to do rn imo is to introduce something at the state level. Programs that make healthcare more affordable for the most common issues that region faces.",

I would absolutely pay more and over having government steadily drive up prices and remove options from the market. Years ago I went outside my job and shopped around to find private coverage. I did the legwork. The companies I found offered coverage that was affordable and when I got hurt they covered everything the way they were supposed to. ACA forced them to close down. Those companies no longer exist and you can't just go buy insurance directly from private companies anymore without going through government markets. The cheapest plans are 3x what I paid then and don't cover as much. Not even close. We need to get government out of it completely -- or allow minimum involvement. A couple of laws forcing pricing transparency for all providers and enabling companies to offer the same plans across state lines to anyone who wants to sign up would fix most of our issues.

The population skews young, and as a result generally there's a lot of people I see with limited real world experience. There's a lot of blue collar hourly paid workers here on most mainstream subs, and while there isn't anything wrong with that, there's also portions of the workforce who are working in stable white collar office jobs with college educations, etc. I'm in tech myself, so we're very fortunate to have good healthcare plans. I had a discussion with my colleagues before, particularly those from European nations, and the consensus was generally that the healthcare we get here from our companies is at minimum equal and most agreed it was better than state healthcare from the EU. However we also agreed that average or median healthcare in the US at least is pretty bad and the Obamacare plans here and level of care you get here is pretty shitty unless you pay a huge sum of money that most people can't afford.\n\nWhen we look at things like cost, quality of care, access, etc a lot of that actually works out in our favor. For instance, cost is high in the US, but one thing people ignore is jobs pay really well here. In tech, salaries in the Bay Area are easily 50% more (if not higher) than what you'd get paid if you worked for Google in Zurich or Warsaw or London. That extra money more than easily covers the cost of healthcare here in the US. Second, the plans that most FAANG companies are offering give a high amount of coverage in the US that easily beats out most employers. Sometimes its excessive. I've had coworkers complain as a first world problem that going to the dentist 4 times a year is too much but they keep up with it because otherwise we're throwing money away for our healthcare, but previously their yearly or 2x yearly cleanings were more than enough. I think everyone loves the perks we get through our employers, but at the same time it's actually quite a bit if you want to go through each one and take full advantage of each. You wouldn't even have time to get all the checkups and diagnostics done that you have available at your disposal.\n\nAnyway, what I'm getting at is there's people with genuinely good care and people who are  satisfied with the US system. Not everyone is broke. Not everyone is unable to pay for care. Not everyone is lacking care either. I think we spend a lot of time on Reddit complaining about America but also fail to realize that even if 10% or 20% or 30% of the population is doing fine, we should figure out how things work fine for those Americans and try to expand that level of access to everyone rather than telling everything that what they enjoy is shit.",

Everyone should get that luxury.\n\nThe result you want is nice. I don't think you'd find people opposed to the idea of everyone getting everything; the people you are referring to oppose HOW it is done, the consequences of trying, and the feasibility. I can try to change your view with maths:\n\nRight now we have an enormous welfare state. Nearly $1Trillion spent annually. Consider that truly for a second. It's massive already, but reading all the state-socialist media on the topic of welfare would make you think America didn't give a shit about it. So the the view is that despite all the massive failing publicly funded programs we have currently, it pales it comparison to what we need, right?\n\nRight now the working class is taxed ~25% (for the sake of argument, though it gets complicated on purpose). That revenue collected in **taxes** doesn't even pay for 1/2 of what we do have. For the rest, our federal government **prints money** (which steals a proportional value from everyone's dollar via inflation, but hurts lower income folks more because wealthy folks put their wealth into investments), and **borrows money** (which steals from future generations, and we already have over $130Trillion racked up in national debt and liabilities).\n\nSo, the above paragraph alone already illustrates a failing state, unless we roll it back dramatically. [Economics Explained has some great videos](https://youtube.com/c/EconomicsExplained). We could adopt Bitcoin and forget about the dollar we destroyed, but that's gonna hurt a lot of people in the transition, essentially leaving most people out and propping up the most powerful oligarchy in history. What do you do if you want more but we can't even afford what we have now? \n\n**Tax more?** We can't really keep raising taxes because we reach a threshold where people are so disincentivized that they move, stop working, or become agorists. Look at all the industry we've lost as a result already, for example. Increasing taxes to 50% will still not even pay for what we have now. Not to mention the ethical dilemma of using a state authority with a monopoly on violence to steal from people to fund things they don't get to approve, most of which is ultimately misallocated to crony special interests anyways.\n\n**Print more?** Might want to check those videos out, especially the history references. Not an option. We're letting them print more than ever right now, but the crash is gonna hurt. **Borrow more?** We already owe more than we could ever pay back (until the dollar is worthless, which defeats the point in getting paid back).\n\nOk, we don't have a viable way to get more money, and seeing as we're living in the largest bubble ever created we crossed that line a long time ago. The demand for more is an impossible dream. We can either 1) print and borrow to give everyone a few months of social welfare utopia before the monetary system collapses, 2) enslave the entire working class, or 3) start rolling back the state, spend $ on us and not on wars and foreign \"aid\", stop letting Congress pass millions of pages of spending without reading it, teach our children about voluntarism and responsibility, address the causes of poor health, and stop incentivizing apathy.\n\n**This is what we are suffering from and headed toward right now:** good-hearted well-intentioned people who just want better for everyone (democratic-socialists mostly) being manipulated by politicians and their corporate elite relationships to vote for giving more centralized power to fewer people in the oligarchy; to steal, print, and borrow more; and to pass legislation which benefits those at the top by incrementally removing their competition. They are being conned by the epitome of crony-capitalist greed who they claim to hate, and dragging everyone down toward collapse in the process. Guess who will still be standing...\n\nNo one needs to believe in the anarchist utopia instead, but we all really ought to listen to what they have to say about **Voluntarism**, and constitutional minarchy, and free trade/free market exchanges.",

But considering that 15-20% of the entire cost of health-care is for overhead and profit, as well as the current levels of inefficiency, incompetence and corruption, I can't really see how a government-run system could be worse.\n\nAnd anyway, we don't really want the government running the health-care system, we just want the government to be paying for it (single payer) with the revenue coming from taxpayers.\n\nSo the only change for the public is, instead of all of us collectively paying $5 trillion a year, we instead pay taxes. The taxes are based on income, so poor people pay less (or none), the middle class pays the largest portion, but the rich pay more (as individuals). \n\nBut the only way there can be any cost savings is if the government sets rates for medical services that are better than what is paid now. And that's a real tricky problem. Right now, insurance companies have a profit motive to try to keep costs down.

I think this would be an issue, because When the government pays for healthcare individuals’ health become a matter of public policy. Eg it would be much more expensive for a country of cigarette smokers, obese people, or any other high risk group To insure it’s populace than a healthy country. \n\nHaving universal healthcare means you can’t have large groups of people actively working to increase their healthcare costs. This means increasing taxes on things like cigarettes and alcohol and limiting things like high sugar and high fat foods. \n\nI lived in New York when the mayor passed a rule limiting the amount of soda that can be served at one time. People lost it! They were complaining that limiting the amount of soda one can buy was an infringement of their rights. Then, people started coming up with work arounds, like buying multiple containers. \n\nI think for a universal healthcare system to work and not bankrupt the country sacrifices like this will have to be made and I don’t think Americans will appreciate that by giving up some of their “freedoms” they are making life better for everyone.",

Right now there is a large push from private enterprise to change over to a private health care system similar to the US. \n\nThe main source for this is reducing funding for health care and not growing healthcare with population. I lived in Edmonton for quite some time, which has some of the best health care sources in North America. Since I moved here population has grown almost double (850,000 to 1,491,00).

There is simply just too much in the way. Keep in mind, everything free isn’t free. It’s taxes, which I don’t assume you don’t know of. \n\nSimply put, medical care in the United States is atrociously expensive. Common procedures in other countries that would cost a solid grand would cost twenty-five grand in the US. Carry that metric over to the rest of the entire medical industry, and you have the US Health System, sometimes even worse than a 25x metric...\n\nA dollar gauze would be ten. \nA fifteen dollar scalpel would be a hundred...\n\nAnd a doctor’s pay? Pathetically large. A lot of doctors are millionaires for what other doctors outside of the US do for a more understandable wage, say $80k a year. \n\nSo let’s look at taxes. I’m going to make some numbers up to just lay out a general figure. \n\nIn another country, let’s say a simple tonsillectomy, would cost $1,500. $250 to the doctor and the rest to the hospital and supplies. In the US, a tonsillectomy might cost $30,000 despite the actual cost being identical to an out-of-country price. \n\nNow imagine the entire spectrum of procedures. From simple tonsillectomies to entire open heart surgeries and whole musculoskeletal swathes of operations, not to mention cancer and the price of those procedures and treatments. \n\nThe price is downright comically massive. For a real-world example, my brother had a bone tumor removed from his knee and the missing bone replaced with medical concrete and pins/screws. The entire operation, which took a week, was almost $600,000. Luckily, the hospital was willing to work with us. It was a university hospital and in turn for using the procedure as a learning experience for them and their students they made the billing free. We would have been financially destroyed for our entire family’s lifetime. \n\nApply that to taxes and....\n\n\n$2,000/year taxes would now have to be $4,500/year and people just simply can’t afford it. These numbers aren’t real, I’ve pulled them from my ass, but they are only examples. \n\n\n\n\nFor a TL;DR...\n\nUS medical costs are soooooo comically huge that if applied to taxes, it would wreck everyone’s financial standings. Lo and behold, not worth even having if even everyone collectively can’t pay it. \n\nMedical insurance is about the same explanation.\nObamacare is a joke, as those who wish to not get insurance (government mandated) they were penalized in their taxes for it anyway—and didn’t receive healthcare for it! Who would want to pay $200/month ($2,400/year) for insurance that only pays for 40%-ish of the cost? And if they didn’t get insurance, the tax people would penalize you the same price anyways and you don’t get to reap your reward of shit health insurance.",

They don't care that traffic everywhere improves when there are less people begging in the streets (often a result of lack of mental health care or debt from healthcare), or that pandemics and outbreaks can be halted sooner or prevented altogether when everyone has access to medicine, or that a society with children who's mothers all received prenatal care ensures less brain damage and other health problems which strain the mental ability of the individuals who grow up to be the idiot who is always a pain in your ass but might have been smarter had they not been born so damn stupid to start with...

Will budget increase as minimum wage increases?\n\nBecause the Department of Developmental Disability in Arizona is breaking down due to minimum wage increases. Funding for DDD never went up, so caregivers continue to make *at maximum* $15. Pay starts at minimum wage. In order to work attendant care I have to have 7 different certifications. It's basically CNA work and we start at the same or lesser value as someone flipping burgers. To put that into perspective, I got my food handler's license at 16.\n\nWe've been actively losing providers in the healthcare industry on the side of disability care because it's state funded. You can make the same amount of money at Target, Chick-Fil-A, or Amazon *day one* as you would make after caregiving for 3+ years assuming you get good reviews. I'm still doing the work because I'm passionate about what I do and there's so few good caregivers left since most can't even afford to work here anymore. But my husband works and makes enough money to support the both of us. If that weren't the case you better bet I'd be going over to somewhere else instead.\n\nSo with that in mind, I'm concerned the same thing could happen to the healthcare industry. Will nurses and doctors be paid the same as they were in private hospitals? That's very unlikely. Then there won't be as much incentive for people to major in medicine or continue to go through a gruelling degree program to become a nurse.

However, I view it as people lacking the ability to control their spending/saving and they want the government to do it for them.  The US system is more about paying later, whereas other systems are paying up front and not later.  Our system requires for you to have savings because you're paying significantly less up front due to the lack of taxes.  Additionally, this does not work really for the lower class, and maybe even the lower-middle.

            "text": "You are overestimating how easily benefits can be achieved and how they will be perceived.\n\nOne many Americans do not actually pay for their healthcare because companies pick up a lot of the tab. Now I personally think this is terrible since it ties employment to work and puts a lot of opacity into healthcare, but the psychological affects are that people think they aren't paying for healthcare would suddenly be confronted with higher taxes (even though they are getting lower wages).\n\nThe Biggest issue though would be fighting every medical interest, something that most politicians probably can't face due to the public being far more likely to side with doctors.  To be clear Canada and UK have cheaper medical systems because they say no to certain procedures, and force lower pay on the actual providers. In the US hospitals, doctors, medical device makers, ect. will push back in the face of lower pay. There is no way you can convince me this would be accepted because:\n\n* Medicare cannot negotiate with anyone and even if it could there would be outcry if seniors stopped receiving care to save tax money they don't pay (if one is extremely cynical about senior votes).\n* Foreign doctors have to waste time on a US residency even if they have done a similar one in Canada, the anglophone Caribbean, UK, Australia, Europe, or even countries with reputable parts of the medical system like India and Malaysia.  This does limit the amount of specialists and generalists and probably pushes up pay (the premium on a specialist in the US is 100k compared to other nations)\n* The cap on Medical training by congress can only be explained by controlling the supply of doctors to benefit the field, alongside restrictions on what nurses can do without the supervision of a doctor (like running basic diagnosis).\n* The failure to close unprofitable Post Offices, for which Hospitals would have a similar role as an important service and employer, even if it doesn't hold.  Canada had a huge consolidation wave in the 90s when it restrained out of control spending.\n\nThe reason the UK and Canada are relatively cheap is that they have restrained prices, which doesn't trigger a backlash on powerful medical groups, rather than reducing them largely by not doing what is listed above.  The UK and Canada have somewhat more liberal rules on who can be a Doctor and what they can do (stuff I support) especially when it comes to immigration, but I feel the idea of importing tons of doctors to push down Americans pay will not be received well, especially on the scale needed to push prices down.  I don't think the US public really will let a plan through that doctors don't approve, and I don't think doctors will do anything that will save them less money.\n\nPeople say that we could move the private sector rates to Medicare rates, but Medicare is used to set a floor, private is where the real money comes in and if a new floor is set it would have to be a lot higher for health care organizations to accept.\n\nIts unclear whether or not there is a politically acceptable way to do this that does not involve letting private companies push things down.  See Uber which broke the most common government monopoly to the backlash of drivers who were ultimately shot down when they asked for government support.  I find it very difficult to believe any NYC or major city mayor would have expanded the supply of taxis to the degree Uber did, because the Taxi Medallion lobby would override them for oligopoly status.  Another example is the Post Office which at this point has become a rural delivery, subsidized by first class mail (and the subsidies are falling).  And given the later is supposed to be what subsidizes the post office's mandate of packaging to every American, and its been on the decline for years since email and now is mainly junk mail, and congress has done little to change the system, I can't see them being more responsive to making care cheaper.\n\nSo if you can't save on high cost labor and can't save on low demand services, where can you?\n\nThe magic response here is usually drugs and administrative costs.  Drugs are too complicated due to a lot of factors and the way it is implemented matters a lot (mainly patent reform), however Administrative costs are being a bit generous with how much can be saved.\n\nWhile could probably be saved in a one buyer model, its definitely not going to go down to medicare levels, because medicare currently doesn't negotiate.  If you have to start negotiating, if you have to start saying no to treatment, you will need administrators to figure out who what where when why for what treatments people can and cannot use. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis isn't even getting into ideas like allowing retirees to take their Medicare savings to the Caribbean (which would definitely save money), expanding medical tourism, dealing with doctors that emigrate, which would ultimately add debates between a Medical lobby, public opinion, and governments trying to save money.",

This person would never deploy, never leave CONUS or Okinawa her entire career. She was just a bureaucrat sticking around for the healthcare.\n\nContrast that with one of your examples, Canada. I also dated a Canadian woman, but we only saw one another for about a year. She was stressed out and hated the job she had when I met her. I've seen the other comments around here from Canadians shitting on their system, but in this case the woman I was seeing didn't have to stick around and be miserable. She resigned from that position and went back to school to start another career. The only reason she could do that is because she and her son would have healthcare.\n\nThere have been stories recently where people have annual caps here in the US. One example was a $1m/year cap on insurance benefits. The guy had a kid with a heart condition and maxed out pretty quickly.\n\nSad story, but a lot of plans here have *lifetime* caps. I had one that had a $5m/lifetime cap. Obamacare was a shit bill, but the rhetoric against it focused on death panels. With private insurance, there is no panel. You could have an easily treatable cancer with a high survivability rate given treatment, then hit your lifetime cap and you're fucked.

We get dispatched, show up, check her out, and take her to the hospital regardless of anything being wrong with her because she wants to go and we legally have to take her. Doing this costs her absolutely nothing, since she is on our healthcare system, so she has no reason to stop. Meanwhile it takes up a crew that could be on a more important call, a bed at the ER for an actually sick patient, and nurses who could be dealing with actually sick patients. Meanwhile I am paying for her to do this with my tax dollars. It’s costs HER nothing, but it costs resources and tax dollars from EVERYONE ELSE. \n\nThis is just one example of many.

            "text": "I am an american who lives in france, and I’ve been here for over 5 years as a student and as a full-time and part-time worker. I work here and pay “cotisations” which go towards social programs like healthcare, unemployment, retirement, etc. I pay nothing in taxes because I don’t make a ton of money, but I pay cotisations, which are taken directly out of my paycheck every month. (Many Frenchies have emphasized this difference between taxes and cotisations to me because taxes are for people who make enough money to pay them and cotisations are every worker’s collective contribution to society). \n\nIn france, the healthcare system is a hybrid. Everyone benefits from it. When you go to a non-specialist doctor (think GP), you pay 25 euros for the visit. You’re partially reimbursed by the sécu (the national medical care system) and your mutuelle (type of private insurance that you don’t have to buy if you don’t want to) a week or so later. And by partially, I mean about 22 euros, meaning your doctor visit ends up costing you 3 euros. The reimbursements depend on your level of mutuelle and the medical practitioner that you see.  \n\nMy partner and I pay about 35 euros a month each for our mutuelle, which I get through my work. The amount we pay is based on our salaries. La mutuelle means that we can be reimbursed for more and for more things, like visits to the chiropractor or physical therapist. It also means we’re 100% reimbursed for our general doctors visits and most of our medications. \n\nI’m not a sickly person, though I am a woman and have to go to the doctor for things like my birth control, etc. I DO go to the doctor WAY more than my partner though who is French and grew up in this system. I don’t have any pre-existing conditions, but now, when I’m sick, I actually go to the doctor, I don’t wait. \n\nIn the US, I’d wait until I was sure that I wasn’t going to get better and that what I had wasn’t a cold from a virus that really couldn’t be treated by the doctor. I’d go to work (because no doctor’s excuse) and probably get other people sick (before moving to france I worked in the hospitality industry, restaurants, barista, museum tour guide, etc. and saw a lot of people during my shifts). In france, if you’re sick, you’re encouraged to go to the doctor and get your sick leave (everyone is entitled to it no matter the job) and NOT get everyone around you sick. \n\nWhen I lived in DC, I got such a bad bladder infection once, that it moved to my kidneys. In the beginning, I just couldn’t afford $125 to go to the clinic and see a doctor (this was even with my American insurance). I thought maybe it would go away, that it wasn’t a big deal. I had 0 experience with this kind of infection. Eventually, when the pain got so bad, I went. The doctor said I was lucky that I went that day because if not, I would’ve given myself lasting kidney damage and might have had to do dialysis for the rest of my life. \n\nAlso, the night before flying to france to move, I realized that I had an ear infection. It was too late to go to the doctor and my flight was the next morning. I needed to make sure that my eardrums wouldn’t burst, so unfortunately, I had to go to the er. I was slapped with a $1000 medical bill for an ear infection even with insurance. Now, you might think it was stupid to go to the er for an ear infection, and I agree! But my parents and I were genuinely scared of my ear drum bursting mid-flight, and the trans-Atlantic plane ticket obviously cost a lot of money. My ear started hurting at 9pm... it was just really bad timing and luck. When I got this bill, I wasn’t even making $1000 a month, as I had just moved to a foreign country and was working a part-time student job. \n\nFrance DOESN’T have a free healthcare system. It’s a mix, but it’s SO MUCH cheaper than the us. Drugs and doctor prescribed treatments (bandages after surgery, etc) are subsidized. You have to pay, but a reasonable amount... so little, that as an american, I feel like I’m getting a deal. You don’t NEED to get a mutuelle (I didn’t have one for years when I was in my 20s), it’s there for in case you have to stay in the hospital for a long time or want to be reimbursed for speciality visits. \n\nI still have to pay something when I go to the doctor, it’s not completely free. Certain things, like glasses, cost a lot of money, even with your mutuelle. The system is not perfect. \n\nBut as an ex-pat, especially an American, people (everyone, family, friends, my students, Americans, the French, etc) ask me WHY I prefer living in france. There are a lot of reasons, many of them personal and unique to me and my situation. However, one of the many reasons is the sécu. \n\nI’m never going to make a lot of money. Me and my partner are teachers. We love our jobs, but we will remain solidly middle-class forever unless we make a radical career change. \n\nAnd the fact that I know that when we have kids, I won’t go into $10,0000 of debt just to give birth, reassures me. It’s wonderful to live in a country where there are social programs and we help each other out. I feel like I pay around the same (or less) in taxes (or in this case, cotisations!) as I did in the us, but I have SO many benefits that I actually get to use as well. In the us, I paid for Medicare that I didn’t benefit from, I paid for social security, which they aren’t sure will last to my generation’s retirement and isn’t actually enough to live on once you retire. I paid for others, but had no security net myself. That is already what we do in the US. \n\nPeople laugh when I say la sécu as one of the reasons that I prefer living in france (one of many) but it’s true. I’m not sure if you can understand the potential for stress, anxiety and BAD HABITS that come from a system of paying so much if you’ve never been removed from it. \n\nMy american auntie and uncle feel the same way as OP and some others on this thread. I actually did get them to see my point of view with this argument. They are wealthy libertarians, so no way to convince them to change, but they said that my perspective helped. \n\nObviously, france is not the US. The systems are different. There is more job security here (at-will employment definitely does not exist) and it’s a much smaller country. I’m not saying that the US should adopt this system, but I am saying that I’ve lived in both as an adult who gets sick occasionally. I can tell you that my medical-related anxiety is much lower here than it was in the us. \n\nThis was really long, and my first time posting a reply like this. I hope this argument gives you another perspective!",

I was the sole income for a family of 4 with a wife needing a lifetime of medical care (she’s doing well all these years later but still requiring medications and treatments). Most of her care for her injury and resulting condition are NOT covered by my insurance. She was eligible at the time of her injury to go on Medicare and have her care taken care of by the American people. We elected to NOT put her on the public dole as we did not feel it appropriate. There was no reason for taxpayers to take on her burden, it was our life and our responsibility. Would it have benefitted us to have placed her into the “single payer system”....absolutely. Could we in good conscious do that...absolutely not. \n\nThe ironic part is now that I retired I was forced by Federal Law to activate her Medicare to maintain our healthcare (still doesn’t cover her injury and condition) and because we didn’t put her on Medicare 25+ years ago we pay a penalty of over $300 a month.  That’s right we are penalized for not taking public assistance years ago because we didn’t feel it was right for us to do so. We still do not support a “National Healthcare System” for numerous reasons I won’t go into here because it’s off topic, other than to say we don’t have a Healthcare problem in this country.

I am health insured as a dependent on his plan. I also had my gallbladder removed in July of 2020 so I’ve had my fair share of experiences with both systems. I still struggle with the fact that everything here feels excessively expensive compared to Germany. I’ve never gotten a medical bill in my life and yes I paid a monthly premium to be health insured (168€) but my husband is doing the same thing here. He pays about the same monthly from his paycheck for us to be health insured yet we still have a deductible of $2000 and a max out of pocket of $4000. My health insurance in the US kept trying to tel me how good my insurance is cause 6k a year is so little but when you’re used to all of this for free it still feels like a terrible lot. Now what I’ve come to understand tho is that generally Americans earn more money than Germans but cost of living and out of pocket costs are higher I would say. Quality of healthcare I feel is better in the US, wait times are short to be seen by doctors. Best example is my gallbladder. I had never seen a doctor in the us and we were in the middle of a pandemic. I found myself a general practitioner with whom I had a single phone call, she referred me to a surgeon and 3 weeks later I had surgery. If I wanted my gallbladder removed in Germany I would have to either suffer from an attack and call the ambulance and hope to get emergency surgery (often times they don’t) or go through my general practitioner and get referred but referrals to specialists in Germany take months and months. At the same time I feel like the US also offers services that I don’t think are necessary, i was just shown my labor and delivery ward and an example suite for giving birth and I’m just like “who needs all of this?? 2 TVs, microwave, fridge...” like I am here to give birth not to enjoy a 5 star hotel experience but that 5 start hotel experience is what I end up lying a lot of money for 😅 \n\nGenerally speaking I like the German healthcare system more simply because I truly don’t have to worry about my health being taken care of ever whereas I am second guessing whether it was a good idea to have a child in the US since who the hell can afford children here? In Germany I’d get everything for free and then paid for having a child...1-3 years maternity leave and everything, in this country having a baby costs an arm and a leg 🥲 both systems have their ups and downs as far as I am concerned but I would much rather pay into a pot for everyone on the chance that I may get sick but know I’ll be taken care of IF I ever get sick than randomly get sick in the US and instead of focusing on getting better be worrying about the bill.",

The problem with doing everything at the federal level is that the Blue States setting up state level universal healthcare would be redundant with federal programs their taxpayers already pay for, and the Red States can't deregulate more than the Federal Government allows to make their case that overregulation is responsible for the overbearing health care costs. Both sides have legitimate cases, and should be allowed to compete in the market place of ideas known as democracy. If you don't like your state's system, it's easier to vote with your feet than it is to emigrate. \n\nWe have to understand that not every region of America shares the same values and beliefs, which is why I'm tired of trying to force extraconstitutional programs at a Federal level when those powers are supposed to be delegated to States - healthcare, education, welfare, etc. Blanket programs kill innovation - let the best ideas win. If vouchers or importing cheap drugs from Canada creates successful outcomes, it will catch on in more states.\n\nAs for the conservative/libertarian case, it's hard to argue health care is a \"free market.\" It's the most regulated market in the country. The system has tax-advantaged health insurance through work instead of allowing individuals the same tax break, meaning we don't get much say in the matter of our coverage, at least not without costing ourselves more money. We don't automatically approve or allow import of cheap drugs approved in other developed nations. Frivlolous lawsuits have driven doctors' and nurses' insurance sky high. There are plenty of arguments that the ridiculousness of healthcare costs is NOT the result of a free market but instead the result of a market where government manipulation has led to unintended consequences. \n\nIt should also be noted that America has a very high quality health care system. We have the best specialists in the world, and people come from all over to get treatment here as a result. Our pharma industry is pioneering new frontiers constantly with the profit incentive. Whatever we do with the healthcare system will have tradeoffs because it's hard to provide all of quantity, quality and low cost at the same time.",

The best thing is that because of the competition from the free NHS, private care is significantly cheaper than in the US with immensity better care.

Infection got worst and ended up requiring 3 injections of antibiotics a day for weeks (think it was 10?) Each injection cost 100$ and he would have died without it (this was after trying many other antibiotics that failed, at that point he was being seen by an infection specialist every week along with doctor visits at the hospital).\n\nMy father in law required 6x cardiac bypasses 10 years ago.

He was rushed to the hospital where he nearly died again, was in the ICU for another couple of weeks in the ICU he recovered.\n\nEach one of these events would have cost in the hundreds of thousands of dollars without proper insurance coverage in the US.

Our system is so bad I try to stay away from hospitals as much as I can, even if I need it. Most of the time, when I feel sick or have unknown symptoms, I just wait and hope my body can heal itself without the need for a doctor. The reason is very simple: if I went to the hospital, they’d give me an appointment with some specialist for no early than a couple of months, usually with a small fee; then, if the two months pass and I still have the pain, I’ll probably be visited by some pissed-off, bored, unmotivated, third-order doctor who’d dedicate to me the least possible amount of his time, usually between some chatting with his colleagues and the coffee break; at the end of this visit two things could happen: he could prescribe me some more exams, which in turn require more appointments and more waiting, or he could send me to his own private clinic (yes, in Italy doctor are allowed to advertise their own businesses while working in the hospital) where they can provide me with better equipments and more exams. The latter - it goes without saying - is not covered by the PH system.\n\nThe only thing I’d save in my country’s PH system is the fact that we are assigned a personal doctor, whom we can call for every minor issues. The problem is most of this doctors simply don’t give a shit, and they cannot be fired: so you had to go over a few attempts before finding a doctor who cares. And even then, in order to be visited you have to take an appointment, and usually spend hours in a waiting room full of (usually elderly) people, ‘cause you know, once something is free people tend to overuse it.\n\nIn conclusion, my point is that the best possible PHS is probably better than the best possible private healthcare system (assuming we ignore the costs), but the worst PHS is way worse than the worse private one.

The vaccination is being conducted in the public interest and the benefits of mass immunization will wildly exceed the cost, so it's a phenomenal cost-benefit proposition to the government, and without the overhead associated with marketing the drugs, one-upping each other for market share, and the profit motive of private for-profit health insurance and most hospitals, this is also the lowest-cost way for the vaccines to be distributed.",

The problem with national healthcare (in Sweden at least) is that supply doesn't really meet demand. We have a huge problem with hospitals being full and people are dying in waiting rooms. Everything goes extremely slowly, and sure, the medical care you eventually get is good, but you have to wait for ages. For example, when I got my ADHD diagnosis, it took ages, I got the diagnosis literally a year after we started the process, and it consequently ruined my grades for that year. It was free, yes, but I would have paid a lot of money for it to go more efficiently.\n\nAnd free healthcare isn't free. If you have a 39500kr salary, you have to pay 53% tax if you count in all factors. Everything the government grants you that is \"free\", is things they give back to you for paying taxes, and more government funded stuff means more taxes. In America, partly the reason people can't afford healthcare is because you guys already pay high taxes because of your military.\n\nAnd still people in Sweden love having free healthcare, even though everyone knows about the problems. I think people just like what they think is normal. It's the same with USA with people disliking tax funded healthcare just because it isn't normal to them. I'm not saying either option is better, but to just blatantly advocate for free healthcare without any further elaboration is pretty ignorant.",

This group does not want to change as they would be shifting their cost burden from split between govt and private companies to purely govt. General distrust of govt and view of bureaucracy as inefficient makes this group not want to go this route. This considers that they would still be paying roughly the same (feel free to argue), but have to fight with the govt if they were not getting the service they want. Currently they would just be fighting with a company and having potential alternatives to walk away to, and potentially govt regulators to back them up if treatment doesn't meet standard. \n\nIn other words you go from having a freedom to move providers and govt potentially being in support of you (feel free to laugh) in the current system, to a system of no alternate providers and govt being against you under single payer system. (note this argument to a lesser degree applies to all subsequent categories) They would be reluctant to change their view. \n\n2. Taxpayer with insufficient health care. This case is easier, this group may benefit if the govt can maintain their costs while raising their Healthcare standard or reduce costs. Generally speaking our bureaucracy tends to be bad at raising standards (see educational system in America as example). Free market also generally works better at price optimization (feel free to argue). They would be reluctant to change their view. \n\n3. Nontaxpayer with sufficient health care. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. They would be reluctant to change their view.  \n \n4. Young/low risk nontaxpayer with insufficient health care. Increasing their future tax burden and optimism of moving to groups 1 or 2 with those arguments handling cover the concerns here. They would be reluctant to change their view. \n\n5. Higher risk nontaxpayer with insufficient health care. This group needs a solution, and may change their view once they benefit, however they are aware of their current state and generally aware that they'd prefer to be in any of the other categories. They are actively working to do so and admitting to needing national Healthcare would be admitting failure and giving up of moving to the other categories. Americans in general hate to admit defeat/failure and hate the idea that they might be stuck in a negative category, so they would be reluctant to change their view as it forces them to admit both of these.\n\nIn each of these categories an experience of national healthcare, even if very positive, would not be enough to completely remove other concerns, especially bureaucracy and general distrust of govt concerns as there remain many other broken bureaucracies to show how quickly national healthcare could degrade even if implemented well initially.

The short version is that I believe in free markets where they exist, and I don't believe that most of healthcare is a real free market.\n\nHere's the thing, a universal health plan in the US without substantial important changes to accompany it will become a case study in failed government initiatives. Can you think of something common to all countries that have nice things like a strong public transportation infrastructure, public healthcare, etc? They've all got very, very dense populations in their urban centers and really, really sparse rural areas. The United States is nothing like that; even our most dense urban centers are incredibly sprawled out by the standards of other, more compact first world nations. \n\nWhy is that a problem? Well, the thing about cities is that they utilize their resources much more efficiently. I'm not calling rural people stupid, it's an economy of scale thing. Take, for example, the smalltown 4-bed ER I work with. Sometimes they're slammed with people out the door, and other times they'll sit around and have one patient in a 12 hour shift. It'd be pretty efficient to cut staff that day if you knew you were only going to have one patient, but you can't do that because you can't tell the future, so you're stuck with paying the inefficiency tax of the slacks and surges of rural healthcare. Now, compare that to the metro trauma centers an hour and a half away. Not only do they serve a dense metro area, but they also receive patients from surrounding counties and hospitals. They are never not busy, never ever (the first time I ever saw them empty was when the lockdowns first happened), so they're always running at a high efficiency. \n\nExcept a whole lot of stuff works that way, not just healthcare, and the denser the population, the more efficient things are (as a rule of thumb). The US, for decades, has encouraged (and taxpayer funded) suburbanization and fought the free market forces that have been naturally trying to increase urban density (see scaremongering about the death of main street America). So, in our pursuit to preserve the life portrayed in Norman Rockwell paintings, we've enshrined inefficiency, and it's a big problem because the US is huge and has a LOT of small towns and suburbs, each contributing to the inefficiency. Ever wondered why the US seems to consistently bungle social projects that other countries pull off on the regular? This is a huge part of it. \n\nSo, any Universal Healthcare scheme in the US, I can almost guarantee, is going to immediately enter a financial tailspin the likes of which will probably become historical legend unless we address our low population density first (or at least alongside it). How do we do that? One way *you* can start doing something about is to start pushing back against local zoning boards that try to stop high density housing projects. It's extremely common, especially in CA, and their motives range from wistful longing for that Normal Rockwell life (unironically saying shit like \"keep the small town feel of San Jose / Fresno/ Stockton\") to outright cartoon villain levels of selfishness (self interestedly trying to drive up rent/property prices; trying to preserve the view from their mansion I shit you not). You can also start voting and pestering your legislators to stop throwing your tax dollars at keeping suburbs on life support. Or, you know, *run* for the legislature so that  octogenarians don't run everything forever.",

The [UK](https://diversityuk.org/diversity-in-the-uk/) and [Canada](https://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2011/03/us-vs-canada-comparing-apples-to-apples.html#.YIlxTu2SmUk) are both 90% white people, literally. [It's a fact that minorities unfortunately have a number of more pre-exisisting conditions than white people](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/communities-of-color-at-higher-risk-for-health-and-economic-challenges-due-to-covid-19/) and that has to be accounted for in a would-be national healthcare system. Secondly, the [US has a significantly higher obese population than the UK and Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_obesity_rate), leaving us more vulnerable to higher healthcare costs as a whole. Lastly, the costs of living (rent, mortgage, groceries, utilities, gas, etc.) [significantly vary across the regions of the US](https://www.patriotsoftware.com/blog/accounting/average-cost-living-by-state/), whereas, in the [UK](https://wise.com/gb/blog/cost-of-living-in-the-uk) and [Canada](https://wise.com/gb/blog/cost-of-living-in-canada), things cost relatively the same no matter where you go in those countries AND tend to be cheaper than the US.\n\nTLDR: The US is more diverse and financially complicated, making a \"one-size-fits-all\" national healthcare system extremely difficult to achieve without a significant portion of the population getting burned somehow.\n\n**The best approach to healthcare in the US IMO is this:** Federal requirement for employers to provide private health insurance to their employees with a 3-tier system that asses risk (obesity, smokers, diet and exercise, etc). In other words, if you live an unhealthy lifestyle, you pay more for insurance. This would motivate our population to make better health choices, lowering the costs of care overall for insurance providers. ALSO, make it a federal requirement to NOT upcharge or discriminate for genetic or accident-related pre-existing conditions (such as blindness, deafness, blood diseases, etc). For those who are unemployed, the Federal government should provide a free public-option that meets the same standards for unemployment, funded by increased wealth tax and slashing the ridiculous military budget (now that the US is finally pulling out of Afghanistan, this may be more feasible).\n\nThis system would keep intact the private health insurance companies that employs thousands of workers. It would also allow the infrastructure of health insurance to be kept intact without a disorganized and partisan overhaul by the Federal government. Costs would be lowered because all employers would be paying into the system and employees would be motivated to live a healthier lifestyle to achieve a lower insurance costs.\n\nSeniors/Baby Boomers are the tough part. I'll say the quiet part out loud, we are going to be dealing with a WORLD crisis when it comes to the healthcare costs for Seniors. [The Baby Boomers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_boomers) are the largest generational population of people in the world. [They are currently in the process of retiring from the workforce](https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2019/12/by-2030-all-baby-boomers-will-be-age-65-or-older.html) and in the next 10-15 years, they will be in nursing homes where the cost of care will rise significantly. They will arguably single-handedly destroy any socialized health care system with the overwhelming cost to keep them alive. [Medicare and Medicaid in the US will be wiped out.](https://time.com/5529152/elderly-caregiving-baby-boomers-unpaid-caregivers-crisis/) And the UK and Canadian systems may be brought to their knees. I see a grim future ahead where governments may need to determine who lives and who dies.",

Still.\n\nI think better examples would be countries like Germany, The Netherlands, Scandinavia, and perhaps even Japan (and probably others that aren’t coming to mind as of yet).",

The American healthcare system is not a good one by any means, but national, socialized healthcare is definitely not the answer.\n\nOr at the very least not the way it's done in Canada. I personally knew a man there making 91k a year but taking home around 40k. Taxes are very steep in Canada. If you live in a city there's a strong chance you pay more to the federal government than you take home to your family, and for what?\n\nRationed healthcare. People who want to get their moneys worth and people who think healthcare is a right booking doctors appointments just to have them. Wasting doctors time. Wasting resources other people need. I've heard stories of people scheduling doctors appointments because they are lonely and just want to spend an hour talking to the doctor. Something they wouldn't do if it costed them money to do it.\n\nWaiting lines are bad. If you don't need emergency surgery you'll probably be waiting months for routine procedures.\n\nDoctors quit their jobs en masse because they are Government workers on a payscale. They aren't paid for their expertise. The worst heart surgeon in Canada makes the same amount as the best heart surgeon in Canada.\n\nPlus it's just wrong from a moral perspective. You actually don't have a right to somebody else's product or service. It may not sound like a nice realization, but healthcare is a product or service. I think you'd have a hard time explaining to me what other physical commodity provided by an expert you have the right to force them to give you.\n\nThat's my two cents. There are pros and cons to both. I do prefer to actually be seen by my doctor, even if it's a little more expensive out of my front pocket rather than no appointment and the government pull the same amount of money or more out of my back pocket.\n\nThere's no such thing as \"free\" for the middle class. The money comes from you.\n\nAnd \"Progressive Conservatives\" in Canada are basically liberals. The only actual conservatives in the country are in Alberta",

There the doctor will pick up on any serious issues at a very early stage. If needed they'll order any diagnostics they deem necessary to properly investigate including blood tests, X-rays, CT scan etc (also free).\n\nContrast to a pay system. If you have to pay every time to see a doctor or get a blood test that's an incentive to \"tough it out\" if you've got a small niggle. Unbeknownst to you however, it is the early stage of something serious.\n\nSo you wait until it's so bad you have to go to hospital. By that time it's gonna be expensive and painful to treat whereas if it was picked up earlier it could have been prevented.",
