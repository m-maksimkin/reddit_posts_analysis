By that standard, the mass internment, brainwashing, and oppression of Uighurs by China is not a genocide. (China is also limiting births, but not more so than they're already doing on the Han population, and not in a manner that would cause the physical, biological \"extinction\" of Uighurs.) It is comparable to other oppressive programs that are also not considered genocides, for instance the persecution of protestants in 17th century France, \"educational\" endeavors as part of European and American colonialism, the forcible integration and mixing of diverse populations within the USSR, or even some of the activities of the United States in the Middle East or on American soil (e.g. forced mass relocation of Native Americans).\n\nUp until recently, the term genocide, in France, carried a specific meaning, related specifically to mass murder, which was particularly meaningful because a genocide took place in France in the years 1941-1945. Now the term is being watered down for political purposes and it is losing its meaning.",
