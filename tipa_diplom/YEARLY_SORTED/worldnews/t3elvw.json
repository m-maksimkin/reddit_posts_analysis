Guys ready to die in senseless wars at the behest of their government because it has always been that way. But do you know what's the matter? Guys of Ukraine keep excellent! Precisely because Ukraine-the same type of thinking. The military of both countries are historically able and accustomed to fight, they are not afraid and do not plan to capitulate at the first threat. That is what makes them heroes now.\n\n**But it also seems very important to me now to understand that the current military leadership (not soldiers!) of both countries has a lot of common roots, common histories, principles that were brought up in them by the country in which these people were born. And this country (not Russia and not Ukraine) is the USSR, because generals, colonels, special services, leaders of military propaganda, practically all the highest ranks are people over 45-50 years old.**\n\n**These people studied in military academies TOGETHER. Scouts and propagandists literally sat at neighboring desks in the KGB agent school. Western citizens, born in normal societies, with humanism and democracy - it is simply impossible for you to understand WHAT IT IS. And this is a whole huge terrible and absolutely anti-human philosophy. It is a system in which a person's life, his freedom, his will and the right to vote, his human rights are worth nothing. WORTH NOTHING AT ALL.**\n\n*I really want this war to end. Not a single one of my acquaintances needs the territories of Ukraine or their population, they don’t need a war in which loved ones die, they don’t need all this economic collapse and life with the need to risk their lives and freedom every day  protesting and being a part of trash for the sake of the ambitions of a crazy dictator. But I am also sure that right now we are torturing captured Ukrainian soldiers, and they are torturing Russians. We commit war crimes - and they commit them too. We are certainly violating some articles of the laws on war crimes - and so are the Ukrainians. And this is not propaganda, this is exactly THAT reason why the people of both countries want to end this war - we know our \"generals\" really well.*\n\n**Nothing will be changed** ***Until KGB generation that grew up and read THOSE TEXTBOOKS becomes too old or dies. Because as long these guys have their power: conflicts and actions during them will never be humanistic and legitimate.***\n\n**They really have a certain right to some of these actions - we are the invaders, for the whole world - it was we who invaded first. But in any case, any war crime is a crime against humanity.**",

They can def be guided to a specific spot much better than dumb projectiles, but the explosive power is different. They can take out a vehicle or even a hardened bunker, but they aren't going to have the kind of kill radius to delete life for hundreds of feet in every direction like a 16\" naval shell could in the 1940s. \n\nThe idea that a Russian destroyer had the firepower to completely erase the regiment on an island within minutes doesn't make sense without landing and/or getting them to surrender.",
