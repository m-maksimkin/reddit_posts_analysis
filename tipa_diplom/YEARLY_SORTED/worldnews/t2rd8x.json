The only way this ends well for both Ukraine AND Russia is if the Russian people storm the kremlin or Putin’s bunker and put him in handcuffs. \n\nRussia could be the US’s greatest ally. We could see greater international cooperation to solve problems than ever before if Putin and his corrupt oligarchs weren’t in charge. The Russian people would live much better lives and have a much better economy if Putin wasn’t in charge. Almost all problems they face can be traced back to Putin and his oligarchs.
