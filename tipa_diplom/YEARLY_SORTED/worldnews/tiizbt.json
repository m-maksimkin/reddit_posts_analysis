I do think they would shift efforts toward cyber warfare, covert ops, and diplomacy backed by bribery/cash. These practices have been well tolerated by the US ‚Äî we barely responded to them hacking our elections.\n\nMy most idealistic dream would be for a reformer. Someone who seeks to ally with the West, but also recreate Russia under an evolved, modernized take on socialism. Corporate greed is a major problem in the West and makes a philosophical bad guy that many would love to see an alternative to. A Russia that competes with us by trying to create a better way to live sounds more impressive than a Russia steeped in controversy for their affronts against the LGBTQ community, Ukraine, and beyond.",

            "text": "I‚Äôm not sure this is a feasible plan. I have a degree in this subject and my academic advisor and tutor was an expert on the subject of the geopolitical make-up of Russia. He used to talk a lot about the role of identity in Russia.\n\nEssentially, Russian identity until the revolution was built around this multi-ethnic feudal empire of Slavs. The various Novogorod and Muscovy people came from ethnic groups that were initially in the Kievan Rus but moved North following the Mongols and the various nomadic hordes who occupied much of now Southern Russia (including now-Ukraine). The Russians united, pushed out the hordes and also the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and established their Tsardom (from St. Petersburg) until the revolution. The revolution occurred and this saw a huge identity shift in Russia. The capital was moved to Moscow and Russian (Soviet) identity was primarily championed by Stalin (more-so than Lenin). Prior to the revolution, Russia had many ethnic groups in various regions. Under Stalin, it became much more centralised. Minority groups were forced to learn and speak Russian and their identities were more-or-less flattened. Soviet identity became based heavily on the patriotism of the Second World War.\n\nThen, suddenly, the Soviet Union fell. Putin has spoken very publicly about how much of a shock this was and what it meant for Russian identity. The country, more-or-less, was gobbled up by scrambling elites. Those who were influential in the Soviet bureaucracy just grabbed whatever power they could - the energy industry, transportation, financial sectors, etc. and basically through most of the 90‚Äôs Russia entirely lost its identity and became a mafia run country of corrupt elites - who we now call the oligarchs. This was possibly one of the lowest points in all of Russia‚Äôs long history. It wasn‚Äôt even a state anymore, just a big network of mafia districts.\n\nPutin‚Äôs rise is explained by precisely this. Putin was a KGB agent, very intelligent and calculating, who (as I have mentioned) was shocked by the fall of the Soviet Union and utterly appalled by the corrupt state of 90‚Äôs Russia. He rose to power by promising to change this - to curb the power of the oligarchs, restore order and root out corruption, and provide Russia with an identity again. He‚Äôs done this to relatively remarkable success. He‚Äôs forced the oligarchs to pay heed to him. I find it hilarious that people think oligarchs such as Abramovich are close to him. The oligarchs essentially had a choice under Putin - do what he says, or flee the country. The reason there are so many wealthy Russian billionaires in London is because the UK opened the door to them following Putin‚Äôs rise as many of them began to flee Russia.\n\nHe has tried to give Russia an identity again - slowly treading a line between a combination of Soviet patriotism (particularly with reference to the Second World War) and also pre-Soviet nationalism. This is also, in conjunction with NATO expanding, why Russia has invaded Ukraine. A big part of Putin‚Äôs promise to the Russian people is to create the identity of them being a hegemonic power once again. No longer a secondary power. As such, he is forced to act aggressively on the world stage. In 2014, when there was an anti-Russian coup in Ukraine and Putin invaded Crimea, Putin was heavily criticised from the people within Russia for not being tough enough. Many people and news outlets in Russia thought he should have invaded all of Ukraine and removed the, what the Russians feel, illegitimate government there. This is a big reason why Putin has invaded now that things have escalated again.\n\nI get that it‚Äôs very difficult for us in the West to grasp, but Putin is actually well-liked by most in Russia for the reasons I have outlined. We find it difficult to comprehend because in the West we have a different set of morals and a very different history. Also, we continually see the Western media prop up stories about people in Russia who feel persecuted under Putin and who are against him (who, I‚Äôm telling you, do not represent the majority and are only getting that attention because of the incentives of the West). However, Putin, to most Russians, has lifted the country out of the huge corrupt mess they were in during the 1990‚Äôs. To the average Russian, Putin has cracked down on billionaire corruption, removed the power of essentially mafia mobs, provided Russia with an identity again and is finally asserting Russia influence abroad rather than just sitting there as a minor power and allowing the West to walk all over them.\n\nSo, to get to my point, if a Russian billionaire assassinated Putin and made themselves Russia‚Äôs leader, making unfavourable peace with Ukraine, the people would not accept it. They would see it as a return to the 1990‚Äôs. A corrupt mafia style billionaire taking over the country again, removing their pride and identity and being weak abroad. I simply do not see this being accepted by the Russian people.\n\nSource: I studied the subject at one of the best universities in the world for 5 years under a leading expert in the field.\n\nAnd disclaimer, I‚Äôm not a Russian nor or Russian agent, nor have any connections to Russia. I live in the West and am speaking entirely impartially.",

Since 2014, Russia has been starving direct foreign investment, which has been inherently linked to a major economic downturn. One of the main factors in that is the instability several investors feel towards regimes who control courts. \n\nStrong judiciary systems are primordial at ensuring confidence in the stability of the rule of law, without which the potential cost of losing big on some guy‚Äôs whims will be worrying. I doubt either a thinly veiled assassination or a summary execution would go far to reassure the general public, States and the financial sector of long-term dedication to the Rule of Law.\n\nMy suggestion would be to \"arrest\" him instead, and ship him and his cronies to the ICC with necessary evidence. Looks like you‚Äôve changed, that the rule of law is important to you, and that you accept international judicial bodies. If you‚Äôre okay with the ICC, it is much more likely you will be as well with the ECtHR, the WTO, ICSID, etc. It has been empirically studied to be true in African countries after cooperating with the ICC, it provided a higher level of foreign investor confidence and an increase in incoming capital flows.",

But people seem to assume that the oligarchs and military were not involved in the planning of the invasion ‚Äî that they are as surprised by Putin's actions and hostile to him as the West ‚Äî whereas I think the only possibility is that they have all been partners from the beginning.

Eliminating him now would just make it harder for them to win the war which they signed up for.\n\nAnything else seems like wish fulfillment on our part. Even if Putin was killed, which would be satisfying, who's to say that the oligarchs don't just continue the war on their own?

            "text": "YOU DON'T KNOW THE REAL RUSSIA \n\nWe Ukrainians are very concerned about the very misconception about Russia in the West. Friends, you have no idea what Russia is. The brutal and inhuman aggression of the Russian army came as a surprise to you, but for us, unfortunately, it was not a revelation. For many centuries, Ukrainians, like all nations neighboring Russia who had the misfortune to live with them in the same country, have suffered from despotic colonial policies of discrimination, repression, and punitive actions that impress with their brutal ingenuity. The number of victims of Russian aggression during the three centuries of occupation is estimated at millions, which is why Ukrainians today are so desperately fighting for their freedom.\n\nFor you, Russia is Dostoevsky, ballet and Tchaikovsky. But the truth is that the high Russian culture was created by the jointly enslaved peoples of the empire, who had no right to voice their nationality to the world. All the best that Ukrainians, Jews, Lithuanians, Armenians and others have created - the Russians have appropriated. For centuries, they have plundered our historical and cultural artifacts, appropriated our cultural heritage, and imported terror, death, and humiliation in return. Modern Russia still forbids us to call our cultural figures of the empire period Ukrainians, representing them to you as Russians.\n\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of ordinary Russians whom you consider victims of the regime today secretly support this regime, otherwise their power would be different. Putin tells them: \"You are the highest nation and you must rule the world. Europeans and Americans are spiritless and corrupt. Russia's borders do not end anywhere\" - and they like it, they applaud him. In the children's anthem dedicated to Putin, the phrase \"We will return Alaska\" is heard and this is their face - imperial chauvinism, revanchism and xenophobia. They manipulate for their political purposes the victory over Nazism in World War II, while devaluing not only the enormous contribution to the victory of the Allies, but even other peoples of the USSR.\n\nPutin openly said that they would have won the war without Ukraine, while Ukraine is one of the most affected republics, for the contribution to the victory of which he was honored to become a founding member of the United Nations. You could meet the real face of Russia in Poland in 1939, East Prussia in 1945, Budapest in 1956 and Prague in 1968.\n\nWe also regret to say that while monarchical Russia treated Europe with hidden contempt and envy, and Soviet Russia tried to conquer it and make it socialist, modern Russia for thirty years taught its citizens to hate everything Western and practiced fake and horror stories. What are the stories that are spreading in the Russian diaspora about European pedophiles who allegedly select Russian children for perversions, homophobic stories and accusations of Catholics of Satanism.\nIt may sound unbelievable to you, but if you carefully ask a Russian friend about it, it will be confirmed to you and will be supported by several similar fakes. Modern Putin's Russia dreams of destroying Western civilization because it sees it as ideologically hostile. Friends, the purpose of writing this text is not to sow hatred, because no one can be discriminated against on national grounds. We just want to warn you that Putin has much more support than you think.\n\nWe, Ukrainian cultural figures, urge you not to devalue the victims of the Russian war against Ukraine, equating them to the hypothetical \"suffering\" of ordinary Russians from their citizenship. Russia has not had a single year of peace in its history, continuously waging wars around the world and supporting dictatorial regimes and terrorist organizations. This rule worked regardless of the state system and ideology, so with the overthrow of Putin, the situation is unlikely to change. \n\nDo not be fooled, such mistakes are costly.",

Then when germany began advancing on France they ended up bottlenecked and bogged down and could have been bombed very easily.  I hate making this comparison, but Putin is following almost the identical game plan that Hitler did just prior to the start of WW2.  And now that it's started we're seeing similar outcomes and issues arising.  Putin, like Hitler, is upset at recent events that he feels hurt his country.  The Versailles treaty to Hitler was far too punitive and basically blamed Germany for WW1.  Putin is furious over the breakup of the Soviet Union.  Hitler invaded Czechoslovakia with the promise of only taking German area and agreeing not to take the whole country.  Putin made similar or other promises about full scale invasion but did it anyways.  The Allies were trying every which way they could to avoid another war but was left no choice once the invasion of France began, they then declared war along with Britain on Germany.  There are so many parallels it's like watching history repeat itself in our current time.  If this continues it will be inevitable that this conflict will spill over in other countries.  I don't think however this will be a long drawn out affair.  Just the opposite, the world has quite obviously overestimated the power of Russia's military.  It is most likely that once other nations get involved that Russian troops will most likely know that there is no hope and that giving up with the hope of either defecting or going back to a completely different Russia is a far better course.  I don't think a nuke will be fired.  Putin doesn't push the button himself, he gives orders.  At that point you have to consider the human factor in this.  Despite orders, someone has to be willing to be the one who started the end of the world as we know it.  Those people still have loved ones and a life they care about and making that decision on what they know in their heart to be nothing more than an act of terrorism that they were never on board with to begin with is a big ask.  I pray that the humanity of mankind would prevail over ideology a nostalgia for what once was and that decision not ever be made.",

He was able to get an aspiring US oligarch installed as president and to hobble our legislature. But he needed more time and even  disinformation, fraud and voter suppression couldn't keep the hand-picked US president in office for a second term.\n2. **He counted on his installed US president to take us out of NATO to weaken its military power in preparation for his plan to invade Ukraine, but it didn't work.** He already threw a fit when Ukraine expressed its interest in joining NATO. Despite his continuing disparagement of NATO, DJT wasn't able to pull us out of this alliance in his first term. The American people didn't see fit to invite him back for a second term in spite of the best efforts of his foreign and domestic co-conspirators to install him by hook or by crook.\n3. **Failing to keep his presidential pick in office long enough to get the US out of Nato, Putin STILL went ahead with his plan to invade Ukraine**\\--He thought he could convince the majority of the Russian people and onlookers all over the world of the lie that he was pursuing the noble goal of 'denazifying\" Ukraine instead of  being the aggressor, committing atrocities in a senseless, cruel war.\n\nWhether it's his failing health, 'roid rage or something else that contributed to these major mistakes, **Putin's poor showing in Ukraine is but one in a long string of miscalculations.**",

It will just mean that Putin will be used as a scapegoat while those who kept him in power for decades will be spared.  \n\nI reckon the best situation for Russia would be to put Putin on a trial for war crimes. It will not only take him down and humiliate dictatorship (which can also impact the way we see other dictators) but also will take down people related to Putin with him. It won‚Äôt just free the world from Putin, it will free Russia from the cancer rotting it‚Äôs political elites and economy, stealing from its citizens.   \n\nWithout helping Russia to free itself from that rotten head and allowing it to finally become democratic, the Cold War will never be fully over and we will never be able to resolve issues in Syria or in any other countries which are breaking democratic rules or are outright dictatorships.",
