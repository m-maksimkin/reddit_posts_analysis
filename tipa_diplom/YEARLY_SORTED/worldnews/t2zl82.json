The more the US and EU try to punish the Russian people, the more Russia will destabilize the world.  There are no winners.  It also frightens people in other countries so that they will submit to fascist rule- forsaking democracy less in the long run.  \n\nPutin is testing his military on an easy target- a bunch of drunken slavs.  His so-called military failures will separate the wheat from the chaff and allow him to fire incompetent officers.  The result, a streamlined, battle tested, military that is ready for the next invasion against a harder target.  \n\nPutin has a lot of followers in Europe and Ukraine.  They are silent.  They are waiting.  The Ukraine invasion was necessary to show his supporters that he will fight for them.  His pretext of rescuing break-a-way states will allow him to continue his expansion through Europe.  The EU people are ready to take back their countries and their heritage, and feel that the US only creates problems- past and present.\n\nPutin was triggered by Hillary giving billions to NGO in Ukraine whose only mission was to slander Putin and destabilize Russia.  Way to go Hillary!  Putin, and the majority of people in the area, saw what you were doing and became angry at the US treating Russia like a third world country- thinking they could so easily destroy Russia.  Think about it: if someone comes into your house pretending to help your family while really trying to control your family while trying to destroy your neighbor, who is the bad guy?  US-pretender, Ukraine- family, Russia neighbor.  Get it yet?  Nyet?\n\nThe timing of the Ukraine invasion is easy to understand:  a comedian as president of the Ukraine and a senile, mentally incompetent US president.  The US military has been compromised by wokeness to the point we will continue to lose wars for the next 20 years at least.  Giving money to the US military will not make it stronger, but changing the leadership will.\n\nDo you want to solve this problem with the least blood being shed?  The US needs to stop flaming the flames of war and get their CIA NGO out of the Ukraine.  Ukraine needs to stop letting the US conduct anti-Russia activity in the Ukraine.  Let Russian have the break-a-way states.\n\nThe first step, the only way to shut this Ukraine invasion down, is to force the traitorous Ukrainian president to step down, fire his underlings, and get a Ukrainian president that will not be a lap dog to the US.  \n\nZelensky. must. go.",
