            "text": "TL,DR: I spent like 10 mins looking into evidence collected by Mr. Zenz and found strange discrepancies. *Again, this doesn't mean there's no genocide, but it gives potential ammunition to those that deny it.*\n\nFirst, feel free to look at my post history to determine whether I'm wumao or not (would wumao post [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/klluo8/chinese_journalist_who_documented_wuhan/ghaimve?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)). I preface with this because I know it's controversial to even question the definition of genocide, but I hope it's not controversial to question the veracity or at least the accuracy of some of the evidence, primarily from Mr. Zenz's organization.\n\nI started by just causally browsing the [Wikipedia entry for Uyghurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs). Citation 30 there led me to [this article on RFA](https://www.rfa.org/english/news/uyghur/detainees-11232019223242.html) (which is [US government funded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Asia), just FYI). The article links to [this report](http://www.jpolrisk.com/wash-brains-cleanse-hearts) that lays out quite methodically how Mr. Zenz came to the estimation of 1.8 million imprisoned. Caption under [Figure 1](https://www.jpolrisk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/z1.png) in that report says it's a government compiled list of 1494 persons detained or imprisoned at \"no. 12 village in [Azatbagh Township](https://goo.gl/maps/Lc7JApmB4CDdqdzYA) (阿扎提巴格乡), Yarkand County, Kashgar Prefecture.\" I'm fluent in Chinese. You'll just have to trust me when I say that the words above the spreadsheet actually says no. 1 village [Yishikuli Township](https://goo.gl/maps/TGBsmEsyP24793tY8) (you can at least see the number 1). Still, these two places are within the same region, so perhaps someone made a honest mistake.\n\nWhat's actually more interesting to me is the heading of the last column on the spreadsheet (or rather, the screenshot of it...we don't see the other 1474 rows): \"slry.\" The cells beneath are the smoking gun: imprisonment status, roughly translates to, in order of first appearance, \"sentenced,\" \"detained,\" \"re-educate.\" I'm not sure why this column heading alone is not in Chinese. Perhaps \"slry\" is a code word to hide the abuses? But then why are the imprisonment status plain to see?\n\nThe column to the left of this says \"subsistence allowance,\" which is part of [China's social welfare program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_welfare_in_China) (and some rows says \"none“; could mean not applied or not qualified), while the column to the left of that one says \"disability.\" Further down, I noticed that Figures 2-5 were all on poverty alleviation (not from the same village as Figure 1), with no outright link to mass imprisonment. This got me thinking about why these 5 figures would be grouped together, when only one of them, with some oddity in it, directly offered evidence of it. Could it be that \"slry\" is an abbreviation for salary, and remained there after being translated from Chinese? Then, could the original content have been income, instead of imprisonment status? After all, it seems rather odd to keep track of social welfare status, among all the useful info the government has, when you are compiling a list of imprisoned people. Also, literally just noticed this, the title of the spreadsheet is \"xxx village's regular ledger.\"\n\nI know that my speculation on this one screenshot is nothing consequential, and there are many other documents that stand up to scrutiny better, perhaps within this same report. But I hope it helps explain why some people remain skeptical of whether Mr. Zenz is applying too much embellishment in his zeal to fight communist heathens.",

The powerful that live here will never stand for going from making 10 billion to 9 and will villianize anyone that apposes them by calling them racist or radical. Even if these jobs didn't move back to the united states the best we could do would be to move them to our neighbors so they will stop feeling hopeless and crossing the boarder illegally. As it stands we are doing our own neighbors dirty and giving money to a pos dictatorship.  Also this would solve the republicans problem of immigrants illegally crossing the boarder.

In fact, judging by streets and markets filled with uyghurs casually going on about their lives, China was either innocent here, or it really sucked at genocide. The only thing unusual in Xinjiang compared to the rest of the country was that there were visibly armed police personnel patrolling the streets, which I never saw in any other part of the country. But again, according to my local guide, uyghurs made up about half of Xinjiang’s population. If there had been any systematic removal going on, there would bound to be some form of very visible social unrest in about every city, which I can safely say from my first hand experience, was absolutely no where to be seen, at least 2 years ago.",

We have a head of state until they either die or abdicate there's no political campaigning, populism, or any of that involved in succession.\n\nIt also means that we have a head of state that is likely very experienced in politics. Maybe not quite the philosopher Kings, but nonetheless someone who has been prepared for the position for the majority of their life. Elizabeth has known every PM since at least Churchill and has held weekly meetings with every single one of them.",
