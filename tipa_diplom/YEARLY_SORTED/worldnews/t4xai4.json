(Anadolu Agency)\n\nSINAN TAVSAN, Nikkei staff writerMarch 2, 2022 12:15 JST\n\nISTANBUL -- Turkey has denied a request from Russia to sail several naval vessels through the Turkish Straits, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told local media on Tuesday.\nInvoking the 1936 Montreux Convention, which gives Turkey the authority to restrict passage through the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits, Ankara politely told Moscow that it would not be allowed, Cavusoglu said. \n\"Russia wanted to transit four naval vessels on Feb 27-28 through the straits, but according to our records, three of them were not registered to Black Sea home bases. Hence, we told Russia not to transit these ships and Russia told us, they will not transit them,\" Cavusoglu told local Haber Turk TV in an interview aired Tuesday night. \"We informed this today to all Montreux Convention states officially,\" he added.\n\nThe convention regulates the key waterway between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. During peacetime, warships have free access through the straits if they give prior diplomatic notification to Turkey. The convention also offers different levels of authority to Turkey, according to whether the situation is peacetime, wartime, or if Turkey itself is \"threatened with imminent danger of war.\"\n\"In a friendly manner, we told Russians not to transit these ships. We told Russians and others not to have hard feelings, as Montreux is valid today and tomorrow and we will implement it,\" Cavusoglu said.\n\n￼\n\nAfter internal deliberations with legal experts and military officials, Ankara concluded that the current situation constituted a \"state of war.\" This paved the way for Turkey to invoke Article 19 of the convention, which notes that vessels of war belonging to belligerent powers shall not pass through the straits. Ships with home ports in the Black Sea are exceptions.\nCavusoglu said that if the ships are registered at Black Sea home bases, \"they can return back to their bases and we cannot prevent it.\"\nThe foreign minister said that Russia had been asking for years how Turkey intended to implement the convention. Moscow's concern was how, during the 2008 Russian invasion of Georgia, the U.S. had tried to sail naval ships heavier than the convention permits into the Black Sea. After consultation with Turkey, the U.S. eventually sailed the vessels into the Black Sea within the convention parameters.\n\"We have been telling the Russians they should not worry, that Turkey will fully implement the convention,\" Cavusoglu said.\nRussia is not expected to protest Turkey's decision strongly, as it has already undertaken a significant naval buildup in the Black Sea.\nAfter a cabinet meeting Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced the country will invoke the convention to regulate the passage of warships at this time.\nAfter the announcement, Ukraine's ambassador to Ankara, Vasyl Bodnar, said Kyiv was grateful for Turkey \"meticulously\" abiding by the stipulations of the convention. \"In today's situation, this is a very fair decision that needs to be implemented,\" Bodnar said.\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also praised the Turkish decision during a Tuesday phone conversation with Cavusoglu, and thanked Turkey for its \"strong support in defense of Ukraine and its sovereignty and territorial integrity,\" according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price.\nAlso on Tuesday, Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told broadcaster CNN Turk TV: \"If there is an application [for passage], we will focus and make an evaluation based on their home base and where it is coming from, where it is going.\n\"There are objective rules and there are parts open for our interpretation,\" he said.\nTurkey is interpreting and implementing the Montreux Convention in a way that will prevent escalation, Kalin said. \"We are urging all sides not to come with such demands. We are telling them not to start with something that will make the Black Sea part of this.\" While countries can ask us for passage, \"we do not prefer it,\" he said.",
