Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days.\n\nRussians didn’t have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can’t physically fulfil the orders for weapons. Rifles and ammo are the most they can do.\n\nThe next Russian weapons can be produced in 3-4 months – if even that. They have no raw materials. What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.\n\nIf Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations. Because they have no money, weapons, or resources. Nevertheless, they are indifferent about the sanctions.\n\nAlpha Spec Ops have been near Kyiv since the 18th February. The goal was to take Kyiv and instal a puppet regime. They are preparing provocations against innocent civilians – women and children – to sow panic. This is their trump card.\n\nRussia’s whole plan relies on panic – that the civilians and armed forces surrender and Zelensky flees. They expect Kharkiv to surrender first so the other cities would follow suit to avoid bloodshed. The Russians are in shock of the fierce resistance they have encountered.\n\nThe Ukrainians must avoid panic! The missile strikes are for intimidation, the Russians fire them at random to “accidentally” hit residential buildings to make the attack look larger than it really is.

Russia knows it cannot take on NATO alone and this is why they've wanted to discuss Ukraine as a neutral country. Russia and the US have both said the other declined peace talks. \n\n\nLogic dictates it makes no sense for Russia to take Ukraine. I'm inclined to believe more of what's coming out of Russia than the west. Though both are absolutely engaging in propaganda. Russia is a super power and has not sent anywhere near an amount of troops for an invasion. They could level Ukraine if they really wanted to but they won't. \n\n\nTLDR, don't believe everything you're reading on CNN or RT.",

Better to keep them part of the pack in exchange for The Promise they won't do something Really Bad For No Good Reason.  \n\nBut now one of the big dogs is trying to eat one of the smaller dogs.   \n\nAnd at first you think, \"Well, it's not the first time.\"  You remember a time not-that-long-ago when the biggest dog in the pen went after a little dog for no good reason.  Made a mess of things.  Shook out a bunch of fleas that got all over the place, didn't accomplish much except to piss off all the other dogs in that corner of the pen.  Again.   \n\nBut then you start to notice, things are different.  Yeah, last time was a little brown dog in a far corner of the pen and this is a little white dog in your corner.  But it's more than just color and location.  That last little dog really was kinda mean and mangey and full of fleas.  That's why the biggest dog claimed it was attacking. And it didn't eat it.  The Promise was stretched, but it wasn't shattered.  At least in your corner of the pen.    \n\nThis new little dog?  Used to be a little mangey, had a flea problem, still does to a point.  But the little white dog has been getting cleaned up.  Dealing with the mange. Shaking out the fleas.    And \\*this\\* big dog is really mean, and mangey, and it loves fleas.  And it's coming to *eat* the little dog.  Big dog is coming to bite little dog's head off, roll it in new fleas, and slowly consume the rotting corpse.  And everything about this is starting to seem Really Bad For No Good Reason.  \n\nThen it turns out this little dog has teeth, is putting up a real fight, and the big dog isn't quite as big as you thought.  So it might not be over quickly.  You might have to spend days, weeks, months, even years watching the big dog slowly rip apart and devour the little one, not because it was mean and mangey and full of fleas, but because it wasn't.  \n\nYou are forced to admit that this breaks The Promise.  Completely, utterly, in an undeniable way.  So you ask yourself. \"Do I trust this dog to decide what kind of activity is allowed in the pen?\"  The answer is obviously \"No!\"  But that's not really the question being asked here.  Everyone knows this big, mean, mangey dog can't be trusted.  What's *really* being asked is, \"Which of the other dogs are going to pretend This Is Okay?\"  The big one that sleeps at the Eastern end of the pen?  The Biggest Dog, who is starting to look a little mangey and schizophrenic?  Are any of the big dogs going to have a real problem with this?  What about the medium sized dogs?  Which dogs fundamentally think it's perfectly fine to eat your neighbor with no justification whatsoever? And how close to me do they sleep?",

It might save invaluable lives. Stay safe everyone.\n\nUrban warfare tips from a former Marine. I am a former U.S. Marine and am of Ukrainian ancestry. I can’t even believe I am making a post like this and it will probably get buried, but if someone has the ability to translate it to Ukrainian please do. I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.For the defenders of Kyiv, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :\n\n1.) Stay out of the steet. 2.) Stay out of street. 3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.\n\n4.) Doors are called “the fatal funnel.” It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.\n\n5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn’t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible. 6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders. 7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You’ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.\n\n8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don’t look above or below until last.\n\n9.) Don’t sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.\n\n10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it’s much more handy than a rifle.\n\n11.) Never fire from the same window twice.\n\n12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don’t expose it.\n\n13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.\n\n14.) If you wound an enemy, don’t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That’s four less rifles firing at you.\n\n15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him.\n\n16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.\n\n17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.\n\n18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don’t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area.\n\n19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.\n\n20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It’s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.\n\n21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.\n\n22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.I don’t know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.Glory to Ukraine.Edit: A few extras.\n\n23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.\n\n24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.\n\n25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force.\n\n26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.\n\n27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn’t mean you’re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.\n\n28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.\n\n29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia.\n\n30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long\n\nEdit: formatted for ease of reading.",

It might save invaluable lives. Stay safe everyone.\n\nUrban warfare tips from a former Marine. I am a former U.S. Marine and am of Ukrainian ancestry. I can’t even believe I am making a post like this and it will probably get buried, but if someone has the ability to translate it to Ukrainian please do. I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.For the defenders of Kyiv, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :\n\n1.) Stay out of the steet. 2.) Stay out of street. 3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.\n\n4.) Doors are called “the fatal funnel.” It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.\n\n5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn’t blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible. 6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders. 7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You’ll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.\n\n8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don’t look above or below until last.\n\n9.) Don’t sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.\n\n10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it’s much more handy than a rifle.\n\n11.) Never fire from the same window twice.\n\n12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don’t expose it.\n\n13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.\n\n14.) If you wound an enemy, don’t kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That’s four less rifles firing at you.\n\n15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him.\n\n16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.\n\n17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.\n\n18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don’t have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area.\n\n19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.\n\n20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It’s very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.\n\n21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.\n\n22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.I don’t know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.Glory to Ukraine.Edit: A few extras.\n\n23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.\n\n24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.\n\n25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force.\n\n26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.\n\n27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn’t mean you’re winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.\n\n28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.\n\n29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia.\n\n30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long\n\nEdit: formatted for ease of reading.\nEdit Edit: I am not the OP",

Getting stuck on the technicality loophole bullshit of \"well, it was the USSR, not Russia\" as if it's a fucking royal family tree counting blood cells and not a question of who has power. All of that is completely irrelevant. The point of the veto power isn't to have a good guys club for buddies who agree on everything. It isn't about \"us good guys with nice western ideologies giving a voice to the filthy barbarians\" that we have now decided they don't deserve any more. It's about a dialog always being open. It's about a place where you at least have to hear disapproval for your actions in the knowledge that what you're doing isn't acceptable to the world - and where you can argue the opposing side. That is better than them not having to feel embarrassed. It's better than them just sitting in their echo chamber. Having a UN with a Russia in it is the reason why Russian people can understand that what their country is doing is wrong. You don't want a Russia in the dark, cut off. Able to do all it does without their own people seeing that reaction of the rest of the world. You don't want a nuclear Russia without a voice at the table. You don't want the largest nuclear power in the world to feel backed into a corner without a care for any historical judgement. You don't want to set that precedent for the other powers either. The world doesn't want more cock measuring contests. It's not the veto that is stopping the world from reacting today.

Countries are willing to sacrifice Ukraine in order to not escalate this into a nuclear conflict and that's the simple truth.\n\nHere's a small digression for you.

IMO, the first step for addressing conflicts like what's going on in Ukraine should be the U.N. , the Security Council, and the ICC, to deal with war criminals. Of course, then the U.S. (and other nations) might have to extradite some officials.\n\nThis is why the US, China, Russia, and other nations refuse to recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, so despite the court being a great option to avoid war, it's rendered mostly useless, except in a few cases of leaders and warlords from smaller countries. \n\nMaybe one day.",

Clearly the US and USSR/Russia abuse it the most. \n\nSome people are saying to require 2 vetoes but that still will not fly. No one will veto resolutions against Israel alongside the US. No one will help China with Taiwan. No one is helping Russia right now. And idk about the other two but they also might be. hesitant. \n\nAlternatives: \n\n* Require a second by anyone on the security council. That one MIGHT fly.\n\n* Require a second by anyone in the general assembly. That would not change the current situation as Belarus would second. I am not aware of any situation this would have changed,. but I can imagine it doing something for the future. This could probably be passed. \n\n* Require minor compensation for using a veto. I'm no economist but I could see donating a certain amount of money for other projects, like a climate change fund. Call it the Swear Jar Doctrine. This could be gamed heavily \n\n* Limitations on vetoes by time. Not my favorite. it would encourage vetoing just to use them. \n\n* Diminishing veto strength. Every time a veto is used, it requires one additional second in general assembly. This would make permanent seats unlikely to use them for their allies, only for their own interests, and only for serious occasions. Over time it would lead to a dissolution of veto power. I could see this being good in the long run but it won't be very palatable. \n\n* Pass a resolution that no more permanent members will be declared. Some feel that China and Russia do not deserve their seats. Not much to do about that now but prevent situations like that in the future.",

Similarly, Serbia had to apply to get Yugoslavia’s seat. The UN treated the collapse of the USSR as less of a collapse and more of a reduction in size and change in name. De-facto, Moscow ran the USSR and continues to run Russia, so it was seen as a common sense move. But the Ukrainian argument is about the formalities of UN procedures, and formally Russia never applied to get that seat. Russia wasn’t even the last Soviet republic to officially leave the Union. I think Kazakhstan was.\n\n\nIt’s an extreme long shot and isn’t likely to pass.\n\nThe truth is, the veto system is outdated. It was basically a prize awarded to the winners of WW2 (only one of which was a nuclear power at the time), but it would be better to rely on a majority vote instead. It would force countries to work together to achieve the majority.\n\nAn interesting side bit. Putin alleges that Ukraine is working on developing nuclear weapons. Except Ukraine already was a nuclear power in the early 90s. It inherited some 3000 nukes from the USSR, more than any other former Soviet republic except Russia. Ukraine voluntarily gave them up in 1996 in exchange for assurances that its borders would be respected. Guess what Russia is doing now? Not respecting Ukrainian borders",
