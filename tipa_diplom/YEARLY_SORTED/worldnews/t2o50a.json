A horrible end to so many Japanese people and torture for those dealing with radiation sickness and cancers decades down the road. They were probably anti-war as much as the next person.   \n**It is vital to remember that the Russian people largely don't want this and do not support this.** The sanctions are going to royally screw them over. We are talking about poverty, potential civil war and even suicides.  \n**Putin is bluffing at the moment.** I don't know if he will change that stance considering they aren't doing too well. I also don't know if the Russian soldiers have been setup... when launching an unnecessary invasion... deploying soldiers to die to get that objective... I doubt Putin cares about the life lost on either sides. It wouldn't surprise me if the invasion has been done badly to be able to ramp up their response so it is more of a war than just an invasion. Not taking anything away from the Ukrainians though!!!     \n**Russia had the entire pandemic to be able to invade overnight.** The capital isn't far from Belarus, they could have easily dropped soldiers in by air or launched air strikes. European states and the US were in no ready state to help.  \n**Biden (no this isn't a partisan political point scoring observation) has a lot to answer for.** Putin wasn't going to invade until the US were fanning the flames. To secure World Peace needs to have compromises. The US failed to open proper dialogue with the Russians. If they want to be the world power they need to take responsibility for it. Instead, they wanted this invasion/war as a distraction to the awful health inequality experienced in the US for covid. Don't be side-stepped, hold your government to account. The conflict is far from the US but it will have knock on effects such as with oil prices.   \n**The Western propaganda over this conflict is appalling.** I want to know facts not bias. Russia could be \"winning\" so far for all we know. After the Cold War nobody in the West is supporting Russia so there didn't need to be this ante spin. The coverage has been on select parts such as a missile attack of an apartment building... I am sure the Russians have plenty of missiles... just the one attack? It is interesting how some regimes in the world silence people so they cannot get their word out (China, NK etc)... and in others its \"open\" with algorithms behind the scenes deciding what gets seen and that is usually misinformation including old footage.\n\n**All morale boosters but very little news on what is going on**, down on the ground. We won't know until the EU or US draft in supporting armies. I was always suspicious how mainstream media were reporting aerial footage of intelligence. This is secret data that never makes it to the press until it has been declassified decades later.",

Putin will lose all his support from the wealthy, the russian locality, the russian chiefs/governing officers. Economically, russia has been pretty much ass raped with the swift sanctions - russian businesses are going to be crippled, any relevant imports cut off and so on and so forth. \n\nIf he wins : russia is still fucked but putin at least has some negotiating power occupying a nato adjacent country. putin will need a lot of damage control, but he'll eventually regain trust that he's lost over the past two days. \n\nEither ways, the sanctions are probably not going to last since russia is an important global socio-economic hub from multiple viewpoints. \n\nThere is little chance any russian operating at the military level is going to back off now, if anything, putin will do all he can, short of using nukes obviously, to win this war - too much rides on it for him and his supporters and russians in general. This probably means the war has just begun - no matter who ends up winning (even if russia \"wins\", I don't exactly know what more they win than an enemy state that they need to spend exuberant resources to control and to purge opposing voices because of the titanium balls on ukrainians) ukraine will see casualty and destruction - a lot of it - in the coming days. It's heartbreaking how this war could have been avoided and how after it began, the sanctions, despite being well intentioned and a sane \"middle ground\" choice to corner russia, will probably spell massive ukrainian devastation - this devastation was probably always impending, since either ways ukrainians seem to be hell bent to also win or die, at least the sanctions will make russia bleed more. \n\nOn a side note : if russians were previously against this war, some will now be for it and will want russia to desperately win. when someone tries to buy food in russia and their credit card doesn't work, they can curse putin and some will - however, it is much more natural to curse a country that they don't belong to - ukraine. they won't see the death in ukraine but their inconveniences, and that'll make a section a russians believe that winning this war is utterly imperative. \n\nIf, somehow, ukraine holds its grounds far, far longer - we could possibly have a world war at our hands. I doubt putin would use nukes - not just doubt, i know he won't - it's too risky - but even without that, a long enough war between russia and ukraine will probably lead to some irrational decision making down the line that might make world war a highly likely scenario. \n\nrussia is a relevant exporter and world needs their goods - realistically. aside from fleeting emotions, russian sanctions won't/can't last long without simultaneously bleeding multiple other relevant economy sectors worldwide. \n\ni hope something completely fucked up doesn't happen - this historically seems very identical to both world wars. \n\n🤞🤞🤞",

The fact we’re all here on reddit tells me you’re capable of thinking outside the box*\n\nDo you guys know the history of this?\n\nBasically a western led campaign ran for years as far back as 1991 in Ukraine and surrounding countries (Sweden and Finland etc) against Russia to have the sentiment of people in surrounding countries to be against Russia. Then In 2014 nato/USA took out the leaders of Ukraine and replaced them with a government which strongly was against Russia. Barack Obama made an oil deal with Ukraine to solidify the relationship and the government in power. This Russian war was supposed to happen years ago but Trump being elected in 2016 delayed that as he was against having NATO surrounding Russia. NATO promised they wouldn’t extend their reach East past Germany but as we can see that was a lie. \n\nFast forward to now, Russia is one of the last counties to not have the world bank or have NATO forces close to it\n\nNow that they’ve tried to set up NATO at the doorstep of Russia, Russia has to retaliate. NATO has been poking russia as far back as 1991 and Russia retaliating is a defensive as history shows with Sudan Iraq, Libya, Syria etc that NATO eventually invaded the country to have things there way and aim to connect all countries to one system.\n\nRussia, North Korea and I think China are the last 3 countries left.",

And now an insecure little man that has bragged about his stripper poles and his sexual escapades involving him having his way with multiple women at the same time, now threatens the world with his nuclear arsenal....such a surprise! Im speaking about Putin not TRUMP in that prior sentence. I have little doubt that Putin's ego is incapable of handling any type of humiliation real or perceived, therefore he is a dangerous presence that demands to be removed, yet like all the others of his kind, he's willing to murder to keep his autocracy going.  \n\nPutin is still gambling heavily on TRUMP back in office. I want so badly for this to end with him being overthrown by his own people, but he is such a brutal little thug, especially to his own people...Putin, not TRUMP, and we know that once a leader gets this bad nothing short of their own people removing them ever seems to solve the problem. Does TRUMP still openly state that he wants a similar lifetime appointment?\n\nHas Putin replaced that murderous homophobic pos that the Ukrainians just took out?",

This does not make me want to back down, this makes me want to double down.\n\nWhile I have called for Putin to be removed from power (or this was my position), I thought this could have been handled internally. \n\nThings have changed. The threat has escalated beyond acceptable parameters and he is now threatening Europe and possibly America.\n\nNow I believe we need to take direct action against Putin (sadly Russia would be collateral damage and for that I sincerely apologize) to remove the immediate and unacceptable threat he now poses. Hopefully the Russians will out him before that is necessary and put in power someone who has Russian interests at heart and is not completely cuckoo. (i.e. someone who wouldn't use nuclear weapons except as a defense of last resort... say alien invasion, trump getting elected as president a second time, that kind of thing).",

Any military aircrafts that crashed, did so due to a pilot's error, not because Ukrainian forces hit them (the error was probably flying over to Ukraine, huh?)\n3. Ukrainian military is using forbidden chemical weapons, i .e. phosphorus munition against Russian troops. (Guess that will be a pretext for using biologicals)\n4. All the deaths and destruction are 100% Ukrainian and NATO fault. I didn't want this. But they MADE ME DO IT. \n5. There were NO casualties in Russian military (other than the two idiots making pilot errors, obviously!). That's because Ukrainian military doesn't fight and capitulate immediately at Russian troops' sight\n\nUPD: 6. finally found some government perspective on nukes -so that had to be done because of aggressive Western statements, i.e. from a British foreign affairs Ministry, that this war may become a Russia-NATO war\n7. Also there was a recent decree that forbids any media to distribute any information on the Ukraine conflict, that wasn't obtained from official government media or somehow contradicts it. I.e. if you are a journalist for independent media, you are not allowed to report from site.\n\n\nAnd yes - a good chunk, if not majority of Russian people are brainwashed enough to believe it.

Even if somehow Kyiv falls ( and that is a big if ) the Russian army will pay in blood for every single minute they spend holding it. Beyond that, Ukraine is a big ass country and if Kyiv falls they can just mount a resistance somewhere else, because no one is accepting Putin's puppet government.\n\nIt would take long weeks, if not months, for Russia to get any measure of control over the country, and that's without taking into consideration how actively hostile the population would be. And it is becoming increasingly clear the Russian army is not prepared for a war that will last weeks if not months if it ever ends.\n\nSo there's no easy way out here for Putin. If the tanks just roll back out of Ukraine ( or, you know, if the army pushes the tanks back out of Ukraine, since they failed to account for how much gas they'd need ) he'll be a laughing stock. He can't keep it up for however long it'd take. So what does he do? Burn it to the ground so he can rule over the ashes?\n\nPutin is unstable, but I hope he's not unstable enough for nukes to fly, and if he is I hope those around him are sensible enough to tell him to get fucked. But if nukes fly I can't see NATO ( rightfully ) not getting involved, since the reason they're not getting involved now is precisely so nukes don't fly, and then it's pretty much MAD and back to the stone ages, unless NATO has some shiny, shiny defense systems we haven't heard about yet.

(I am not making this up or exaggerating.)\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin\n\nHe's also the author of a book called Foundations of Geopolitics which is a kind of expansionist primer for Russian manifest destiny - a blueprint for a new Eurasian Rome extending from the Indian Ocean to Ireland. But starting closer to home in Georgia, South Ossetia, and Ukraine. (I am not making this up either.) \n\nAnyone paying attention will notice this has pretty much been the template for Russian expansionism since 2000 or so.\n\nhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics\n\nDugin, like all fascist kooks, really, really hates liberals, gays, enlightenment individualism, secularism, antiracism, women's rights, and all the things that define the progressive tradition in the West.\n\nSo of course Putin does too. \n\nI think the West is misreading the situation. The West is trying to understand this is as plain old imperial expansionist resource war - because fundamentally and quite cynically, that's how we view our own operations. (All the talk of toppling dictators is just realpolitik PR.)\n\nThe Ukraine has gas, minerals, and other interesting things, and of course Putin wants those, now that he has bled Russia dry. \n\nThis is fine as far as it goes, but I suspect for Putin it's *also* a moral crusade against the corrupting and enfeebling forces of Western depravity which neutered the USSR. \n\nRussia must be strong. Russia must be dominant. Russia must be respected!\n\nAnd all of that crap. So he launches his holy war and... it goes badly wrong, because the Russian army - made up largely of conscripted and poorly trained teenagers who never expected to be on the front lines and would rather not die - does not give him the superpowers he expected. And worse - the filthy Ukrainians don't instantly submit to his superior manliness.\n\nMeanwhile the sneaky decadent West is attacking him covertly from all sides, and subverting his authority. Instead of respect he gets derision, opposition, contempt, and financial ruin.\n\nSo - nukes. Because he needs to salvage something to reassure himself, and make a statement.\n\nYou can see where this is going. \n\nI *hope* I'm wrong about this.

Immediate, overwhelming reaction gives Putin exactly what he wants, a release from all his problems. Restraint opens the door for a new beginning. \n\nMaybe another revolution in Russia that finally puts them in the right track and they give up their weapons.

In the second thesis, 21 pages textually coincide with other people's works.\\[5\\]\\[10\\]*   \n>  \n>***On 3 October 2017 the top Russian academic council recommended revoking Medinsky's 2011 doctorate.\\[11\\] However, on 20 October 2017 a committee of a government agency that oversees the awarding of higher academic degrees ruled in the minister's favour by 16 to 6.***",

Nobody wants a nuclear war, and it's kind of unnecessary in today's world.\n\n\nMaybe I'm naiive, but I think even if a nuke was lobbed at Ukraine by Russia, it wouldn't trigger a decision to destroy the planet. It would ruin the chance Russia would ever be a free country again, it would cause Russia to break down into many independent states, and the current regime would be liquidated by revolution.\n\n\nJust my own thoughts. Obviously. Nobody is going to use nuclear weapons, but if Russian used one, it would not lead to the world blowing itself up like we feared in the cold war.

We don’t want a repeat of what happened to Germany (infinite reparations demand launched them right back into a war mode economy). \n\nAlso, Vietnam taught us the lesson of paying heavy losses in blood and treasure due to a “miscommunication” (see the multi-part KPBS documentary on YouTube by, I believe, Ken Burns; but be advised there two such worthwhile series on our embarrassing Vietnamese debacle). \n\nEscalation is not an option.

Is now loosing against an actor, comedian, hero of the west? Sorry for my pessisism but i dont take that, i think this is part of his plan, he wants Nato to intervene to get his reason for his strike, he might have something more powerful we do not know yet. He even said he wants the empire back so there will be no way of avoiding a NATO conflict. If he wanted to change the ukranian system why not easily attack the president persuing a terror attack as a former specialist spy?

            "text": "I currently live in the USA and I've been independently researching on what to do incase of nuclear disaster (whatever the case).  \nThe thing is, I've found an extreme amount of information predating 1990s and found a \"the rest is history\" narrative, as the saying goes. If you attempt to find info on fallout shelters, home prep, or survival evacuation plans for the population you are left with outdated info from the Red Scare and safety protocols and readings about new nuclear power plants. You can learn a lot, yes. And create your own nuclear survival plan. Sure. But what I'm looking for what the average American family will do in case of fire. (nukes go off)  FYI i found emergency plans from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s even the 1980s. but none since. Even though a nuclear accident can happen without notice! Just like a fire!  prevention is key. Preparations for disaster are key.   \nI found so much dated information I started to feel like there was no modern plan. We all know there actually are survivors during nuclear bomb fallout (historical references) and living in a post-nuclear land is possible. After you get past annihilation, things mutate and will grow. So, evidently, there will be some of us left. What's left? What gets prepared? What gets preserved? And if we make it to shelter, there certainly will be survivors to tell the tale.   \nAssuming we have the attitude of survival, like we do when a fire, a tsunami, or tornado comes, is that we will hurry into a safe place, pick up the pieces as a people, rescue who we can, and move on.   \nI'm having a hard time finding info that isn't from Russia on nuclear survival emergency evacuation plans.   \nWe have plans for EVERYTHING; even earthquakes. But not for Nukes? Just to get a straight up evacuation plan mapped out is like we've got the ability to turn into Alex Jones and go all conspiracy searching just to get real.  \nWe need to have a healthy mind about preparing for disaster. Because some of us CAN and WILL survive. Yes, I am thinking years down the line and the exhaustion of food and water. It doesn't excuse the lack of interest.   \nEven if it is \"go to the basement and pray\" you at least have a moment of dignity to gather your family. Care by addressing the situation the average population is in. If grabbing a flashlight and dying in our basement with our family is the only option then we will acknowledge it. But there is more to the story than dying; I think we should promote a plan for the average family.",
