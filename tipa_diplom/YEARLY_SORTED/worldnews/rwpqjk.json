As a child if someone told me that someday the world would start to have crazy weather because of the pollution and the fact that we have too many people on this planet already I would have laughed we just thought life would go on for all affinity no matter what we did the world would adjust but that's not so. I predict the next world War and there will be one, will come because the world is overpopulated in many areas that's so unpopular so overpopulated that they're literally storming into other nations across borders that way they have no right being. Every Nation every faith every race has a right to protect their own survival every country has a right to have their laws respected without having to take the world's overpopulation or illegitimate. I think that's why the Chinese released and they did release it which I consider it a weapon of warfare chemical weapon, this covid virus to control their own population could you imagine world leaders saying we have to control the population will you know what people are like they're stupid they're greedy they won't control themselves they just keep having more and more kids even in places where they can't feed the children they have now they're starving to death but somehow these starving women are still having children. So the governments have to step in and make decisions that are difficult and hard they're not going to talk about it but they're just going to keep releasing more and more of these diseases to reduce the population in the world. Our survival depends on it we are not civilized nor will we ever reach that civilized respectful attitude of respecting the world and other people at the rate of just being allowed to have as many children as we want to without worrying about the world's ability to feed them all and remain intact.",

You cannot make wind turbines without crude oil either, since the composite resins used in them are made from it. Likewise with PV's. So, hanging your hat on renewables is pie-in-the-sky false hope. It's a scam to keep us from rebelling against gov't and corporations. \n\nAll major oil fields around the world are in decline. The discovery curve has fallen dramatically from the 1960's. There is no new easy to get oil. That's all gone. That's why oil companies are going to Greenland or to the bottom of the sea or the arctic (or both in this case) for oil. This is why the EROI for crude oil has fallen dramatically in the last 50-100 years. We are already out on a limb, and unless a miracle occurs, then we will fall as a species on this planet. \n\nThe four horsemen are already upon us: \n\na) peak oil\n\nb) mass extinction\n\nc) climate change\n\nd) persistent pollutants\n\nAny one of those would be a serious challenge. All of those together means the death of the human race by the end of the century. For example, because of persistent pollutants, the average sperm count for viable sperm will be zero by 2050. That means no more babies, particularly in the West (where we have the best data). Peak oil is already upon us and will also spell the end of humans since we cannot support 8 billion people without it. Mass extinction will cause crop failures and other maladies. Climate change is already having an effect and even if we stopped putting carbon into the atmosphere tomorrow, we would still suffer the consequences for about 500 years. \n\nSo, the fact that they can't realize that crude oil can be used for many other things besides burning it means that the leaders of Greenland are profoundly shortsighted.",

Maybe.\n\nBut cutting off local oil exploration / investment (and eventually therefore, production) isn't a global solution. It merely moves the new production to another location, and possibly drives up the commodity price slightly (less competition). Neither result ultimately helps the global environment.\n\nEven if every country did the same action today, all that would happen is we would collectively demand they reverse it, as the catastrophic consequences would soon make our lives very, very much worse.\n\nThe market is calling the shots. If you want to truly reduce oil and gas production, then the global demand must be reduced first. We can't have our cake and eat it too. The only realistic way to do that for the long-term is by discovering an independently-competitive alternative: i.e. a \"new\" product or process that simply out-competes the old one. Cheaper, better, and (hopefully) cleaner.\n\nAlternative / renewable sources of energy are making some fantastic headway, but clearly aren't ready to replace oil and gas in most applications yet. Or else they would have already done so, just like every other new technology has through history. Some encouraging regional success stories exist, but global success is still somewhere out on the horizon. Breakthroughs are needed.\n\nWe can help fund research and development for these new technologies. We can try to reduce our energy usage. We can try to reduce GHG emissions.

That‚Äôs probably why they did it, the significant interest major powers have had in Greenland in last couple of decades is only growing, plus with the ice melting and very valuable shipping routs being exposed only adds to Greenlands value and importance. They don‚Äôt want to be a war zone, even if it‚Äôs just political and don‚Äôt want to be a resource punching bag for greedy companies and much more powerful nations so this decision will help keep them safe and neutral, at least as long as people care about what they say.
