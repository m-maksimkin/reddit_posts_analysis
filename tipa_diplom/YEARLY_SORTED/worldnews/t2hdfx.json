They are not released from airports on private planes.  All fortifications from the Ukrainian side were found and shot in advance.  There was no tactical plan.  I quote: \"we had everything in the course of events.\"  We hoped to take everything in 1-4 days.  Discuss financial losses.  War costs $20 billion a day.  Putin is mad.  I was sure it would be an easy ride.  Rockets are few.  Enough days for 3-4 ceiling.  They are protected.  There are no weapons.  The Tula plant and the other 2 Rotenberg plants cannot fulfill orders for weapons.  Rifles and bullets.  Physically.  Weapons are missing.  The next weapon is really available in 3-4 months.  And that!!  There are no raw materials.  Total possibly longer.  Previously, supplies were mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany.  They are now blocked.  We discussed that if Ukraine holds out for 10 days, then we will have to sit down on the negotiating table.  Because there is no money, no weapons, no resources.  Sanctions are not particularly afraid.  Alpha, special operations forces since the 18th somewhere near Kiev.  The whole calculation is that they will take Kyiv and put their protege.  And the type will not have to spend any money, no military, no weapons.  They are preparing a provocation against the civilian population.  Attack of children, women.  To sow panic.  This is their trump card.  The whole plan is the hope of panic.  And that they will surrender themselves or Zelensky will run away.  They expect that the first Kharkov will surrender.  And the rest of the cities will follow his example to avoid bloodshed.  Problems in Russia with airports.  There are no drones.  We are very upset by the loss of the column near Kharkov and 200 people died.  Serious losses on their part.  Quote: met with fierce resistance from the enemy.  They are in shock.  Task: survive 9 more days.  Remove panic.  Explain about missiles that this is all for intimidation.  They intentionally beat them at random and anywhere and \"accidentally\" cling to the housing of the house.  To create a mass effect.",

Pretty much a large percentage of their military R&D money has been going into their fighter jets(Su-57). Add to that the growing dissatisfaction amongst the Russian population towards Putin's cabinet in general, means that not as many are as willing to fight as Putin would like to think.\n\nIt is difficult to win a war with conscripts, especially when you don't have the peoples' support.

His presidency was insane, he really crippled our relations with foreign countries which would have really fucked us if he were still president during Russia’s invasion since he wouldn’t be able to unite countries together.
