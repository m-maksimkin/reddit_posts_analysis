It seems that Russian authorities has its own propaganda and the Russians do not know what is the reality in Ukraine. We can get online in touch with Russians telling them and sharing videos and any information that can open their eyes. There are many proofs that there is no \"special military operation\" and actually there is a war. Show them videos with towns bombarded and ruined,  kids in tears, shocking videos with dead bodies of kids, women, men being killed by Russian troops and videos where russian soldiers are not welcomed with flowers as Kremlin propaganda says and instead of that they are welcomed as Invaders and occupiers. Let's make this happen. Share this message in every subreddit and hopefully the truth will reach to Russians.
