At its peak, the Nazi flag with the hooked cross flew over almost all the capitals in Europe. Millions of innocent people were snatched from their homes and they perished inside gas chambers.\n\nWho was behind this horrific crime? It was Christian fundamentalists, acting on their age old hatred against Jews.\n\nBut if you are a western historian, you can’t put that down. You cannot tell future generations that every member of the Nazi SS wore a belt with the words “Gott mit uns” (God with us). \n\nYou cannot tell future generations that the Nazi symbol of the hooked cross is a variation of the Christian cross. And you cannot tell future generations about the deals between the Fascist Party and the Church. When tourists visit Vatican City, you cannot tell them that the city was a gift from Mussolini to the Pope.\n\nSo you go halfway around the world and dig out a Sanskrit word for a somewhat similar looking symbol. And thus the hated Nazi symbol becomes designated as the “Swastika.” For hundreds of millions of people in the west, “Swastika” will be the only Sanskrit word they know. And they will despise it. Each time they hear it, they will think that Hitler was inspired by the pagan Hindus.",

American Boy Scouts could get a swastika badge, and the Girls’ Club published a magazine called The Swastika. Finland, Latvia and the United States have all used it as a military insignia.\nIn Canada, a mining community in northern Ontario was named Swastika, just as you might name a town New Hope or Bounty.

Not only does it set a dangerous precedent, but it also does nothing except drive these ideologies underground, where they can fester, leading to further radicalization.\n\nAnd for those who point out that it makes sense for Austria to make such laws because they lived under the Nazi occupation, let us not forget who welcomed Hitler with open arms - that's right, Austria.
