The problem, people, isn't Donald Trump. The problem isn't even the Republicans that protect him. The problem is the morally bankrupt voting demographic that continues to reward morally bankrupt behavior. There is only ONE way to right this damn ship, and it is to drive out Republicans from EVERY office. And I mean EVERY Republican--don't buy into this fantasy that the GOP can be saved that people like Kinsinger, Romney, and Cheney are pushing. It can't. When a party's platform for a presidential nomination convention is \"our position is we are going to suck this guy's little orange dick, no matter what\" that party is far beyond saving; it's an admission that authoritarianism IS the party's platform, period. There are only two options--dictatorship or democracy. Democracy is a game of numbers, and the only thing that counts is having more than the other side; that's the very definition. And anyone who is sowing dissent in the ranks of those who are opposed to dictatorship and authoritarianism might as well just cross over to the party of dictatorship and authoritarianism. Numbers, and forcing out the authoritarians, is the ONLY way to get justice.\n\nEdit: Yeah, I'm not wasting any more time with you fucking fascists; should have realized that reasonable arguments weren't going to gain much traction here in one of reddit's most prominent right wing propaganda safe spaces.

Our intelligence agencies probably know whatever the blackmail is....but somehow it would be more believable to the Trump cult coming from the KGB rather than the CIA. I'm willing to bet several intelligence agencies know what it is. It is probably so explosive that no one wants to release it. But the big Loser is such a threat to world stability that someone HAS TO. And what can Biden or American institutions do to break the spell he has over his cult??? Nothing. But the spell MUST be broken somehow.\nBasically, Biden told Putin \"you guys be the ones to release the evidence of blackmail and you get X\". Since Trump has already done his damage, he's no longer of use to Putin. At least not compared to massive sanctions. Putin saw the writing on the wall and realized it was time to play ball. And so...it's only a matter of time before it all comes out.\n\nOh and i bet it's something messed up too. Like he paid to kill someone for sport or something.

It never says anything approaching \"Putin holds blackmail leverage over Trump and that's why Russia backed him\".  It doesn't even come close.  The only thing that could even be disingenuously twisted to possibly imply the claims in the title is the section that says\n\n\n>The documents include a brief psychological assessment of Trump as \"impulsive, mentally unstable and unbalanced individual who suffers from an inferiority complex,\" and **also refer to \"certain events\" that happened during his previous trips to Moscow.  More details about those events are listed in an appendix to that document, but that portion of the papers remains undisclosed.**\n\n\nThis is hardly proof of anything, much less \"blackmail\" or \"why Putin backed Trump\", and nothing substantiating this appears in the Guardian source article either.

The Guardian article says \"independent experts\" have verified the validity of these documents, but fail to name anyone as an expert outside of a journalist who helped write a book about the Russian state trying to control the internet (which had a limited positive reception from a couple news sources, including the Guardian itself) and a former UK ambassador to Moscow (who is hardly an unbiased source of information considering the UK's relations with both the US and Russia), neither of which appear to be real experts on the inner workings of the Russian state and intelligence agencies. They claim these documents are reflective of typical ways the Russian state operates, but if the knowledge of how the Russian state operates, how its intelligence agencies operate, and what their internal documents look like is so well known by even relatively obscure individuals like this, what is preventing these documents from being faked? \n\nThis is especially relevant considering the only evidence that these documents exist that the Guardian provides is a vague picture of a wall of text on a page in Russian, which they don't even bother to translate for the reader to make their own conclusions. If they have these documents, why not release them and translate them so the reader can be informed and read it for themselves? The way the article cherry picks the claims it wants to out out what is clearly a document of many pages just makes it feel like another Russia-baiting propaganda piece to confirm people's biases about Russia's interference in the US election, which is a media narrative with a lot of unverified claims going back years.",

Their priority is for government regulation and taxes kept to a minimum. Also, they often have never experienced the need for expanded social rights and liberties in their small cities/towns/villages so perhaps think the movements are a bit overblown with the air time each receives not proportional to the percent of the population impacted. \n\nSo, in short, because of the two party system. Conservatives know they are losing votes from here on out without gerrymandering and voter suppression due to an aging population and demographic shift. \n\nOh, and because 1/3 of the population is either uneducated, narrow-minded, and/or easily manipulated by propaganda. How anyone could believe a word Tucker Carlson spits out as “news” on Fox when the courts ruled IN FAVOR of Fox who took the position that no sound minded individual would consider anything said on Tuckers show to be anything more than his personal opinion is simply beyond me. If anyone wants a good laugh look up the video from when Jon Stewart went on Tuckers show many years back and tore him apart for trying to compare his opinion news show to Jon’s comedy show. The line Jon dropped about not being able to take any 30 year old trust fund kid wearing a bow tie seriously was one of the best on-air insults ever  \n\nFull disclosure - although I was “raised republican”, no way in hell I’d ever sacrifice my morals and be conned into voting for the Donald, even if it meant more money in my pocket.",

It also just reads so classically tongue in cheek. I’m not saying this isn’t true, I just don’t know how the hell anyone even knows what to put their trust in anymore haha",

Putin’s Goal: Weaken and divide the transatlantic alliance.\nPutin’s Payout:Trump undermines US relationships with European allies and calls the US’s commitment to NATO into question.\n2. Putin’s Goal: Degrade the European Union and foster pro-Russian political movements.\nPutin’s Payout:Trump attacks the EU and actively supports anti-EU, Kremlin-backed parties.\n3. Putin’s Goal: Disrupt American leadership and dominance of the global economic order.\nPutin’s Payout: Trump is eagerly pushing for an all-out trade war with Europe\n4. Putin’s Goal: Build global resentment and distrust towards the US and stoke anti-American sentiment.\nPutin’s Payout: America’s closest allies are explicitly suspicious and distrusting of the US because of Trump’s rhetoric and actions.\n5. Putin’s Goal: Relieve economic and domestic political pressure from US sanctions on Russia.\nPutin’s Payout: Trump tries to roll back, impede, and blunt the impact of sanctions at every step.\n6. Putin’s Goal: Legitimize his regime in the eyes of the world.\nPutin’s Payout: Trump repeatedly praises and defends Putin, lending the credibility of the US presidency to Putin’s standing.\n7. Putin’s Goal: Revive Russia’s status as a great power and gain international recognition for its illegal seizure of Crimea.\nPutin’s Payout:Trump publicly says that Crimea is part of Russia and calls for Russia to be welcomed back into the international community with no concessions.\n8. Putin’s Goal: Continue to sow discord in Western democracies and avoid repercussions for interfering in American and European elections.\nPutin’s Payout: Trump dismisses Russian interference and has done nothing to prevent future interference, putting him at odds with his own intelligence community.\n9.

In this case, it was both. \n\nHas the U.S. been weakened enough to open itself up to direct attack? No. The infrastructure and institutions that support the people are still there and Biden successfully won the election so Russia's plans have been stalled and we are most likely going to see a reversal of fortune for Russia over the coming years as Trump's influence dissolves and the U.S. recovers from another blow by its enemies. \n\nThe U.S. really is unique in that regard.

It's believed to be a fake, but confirmed to exist.\n\nhttps://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/pee-tape-trump-mueller-report-823755/\n\n\"Buried in a footnote in Section II B of Volume II of the redacted [Mueller report](https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) is a single reference to supposed kompromat the Russian government was rumored to have on the president — the infamous “pee tape.” The report confirms that then-FBI director James Comey briefed President-elect Trump about the report in January 2017, but it also reveals that the Trump campaign was privately aware as early as October 2016 — more than two months before BuzzFeed News published the Steele dossier — that embarrassing tapes of then-candidate [Donald Trump](https://www.rollingstone.com/t/donald-trump/) might exist in Russia.\n\nAccording to the report, on October 30th, 2016, Trump’s private attorney and fixer Michael Cohen received a text from a Russian businessman involved in the Trump Tower Moscow deal, in progress for more than a year. “Stopped flow of tapes from Russia but not sure if there’s anything else. Just so you know….” Giorgi Rtskhiladze wrote to Cohen. Cohen told investigators he spoke to Trump about the issue after receiving the texts from Rtskhiladze. \"",
