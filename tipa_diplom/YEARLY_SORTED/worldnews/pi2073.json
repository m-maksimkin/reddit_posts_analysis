            "text": "As an economist, I am incapable of thinking about anything without first analyzing it in terms of incentives. So let's talk about the incentive structure involved with foreign investment. The most obvious effect that investment has is that there are now more claims against the host country than before. This is even more true if they buy firms or real estate rather than simply making loans. There is nothing special about this effect; it's impossible to make foreign investment without increasing claims on the host country.  \n\n\nThis means that the return the original residents of the host country can expect on their labor falls, due to foreign competition (unless they allow all investment regardless of source). This makes sense since investors require a premium over what those claims would sell for on the international market.  \n\n\nAnd this brings us to a key point: why would investors from other countries be willing to purchase claims within a less developed country instead of investing in their own country? Because they expect to have better investment opportunities at home, and so will put their money there unless the expected return is higher abroad.  \n\n\nAnytime you hear someone complaining about foreign investment in a less developed country, the implicit assumption is that these are relatively poor people investing in an area where they have no previous ties. This is simply not the case. They are wealthy investors investing their money abroad, because it's more profitable than investing at home (or even leaving it in banks, as is often the case with investment from Hong Kong).  \n\n\nWhat we wind up seeing is a global capital market where all investments are made internationally and no longer domestically. The effects of this should be unsurprising: those who already hold wealth will see it increase as those with less wealth lose out (and as they themselves gain an increased share of the global market).  \n\n\nI'm reminded of a line from The Lord of the Rings : \"All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given us.\" Foreign investors face no such choice; their incentives are well defined. Those who would complain about foreign investment should ask themselves why they're not investing at home, and whether they might be better off if they did.",

But I bought a semi detached anyway for 215k, sold it 2 years later for 250k and bought a detached 3000 Sq ft home for 450k. 6 years later I sold it for 650k. Left the province for two years and came back and my previous house was already 850k to my chagrin, it eventually appreciated to over 2 million. \n\nAfter returning back to Ontario, I bought another house 650k and two years later using the equity on the first I bought another detached for 700k, and a year later bought another semi detached for 750k. All three houses are over 1.5 million each now, 30% of the gain came in 2020 during the pandemic, but believe me I was fully expecting the prices to go down considerably when the pandemic hit. No one including bank economists predicted the gain. So we took the risk of holding onto properties during the pandemic. \n\nI moved back to the US few months ago, bought a house online without looking at it. By the time I bought it, houses were selling 100k over the listed prices from year ago, many people were paying cash to buy houses. We got lucky and brought a property 15k under listing. \n\nThe reason I am telling all this is, buy small, build your equity. Don‚Äôt be afraid to flip and take equity out and buy rental properties. My starting salary was 30k and my first house was bought for 92k in Las Vegas many years ago. It taught me how to handle buying properties, selling and taking equity out. Learn your lessons and execute. Don‚Äôt let the market scare you, and don‚Äôt be focused on forever homes. I started with one and ended up with 4 across two countries.

Meanwhile their investor clients bought 7 homes in one month. It‚Äôs hard to compete with all cash offers. \n\nIt‚Äôs so destabilizing for neighborhoods to have more and more rentals. Nit only do those houses likely cost the renter more as a rental than they would as a mortgage. But they also aren‚Äôt building equity or working toward paying off their home so they have a low monthly payment during retirement. Its going to be a huge issue in 30 years when social security has greatly reduced due politicians shortfalls and rentals have greatly increased. If people haven‚Äôt saved a lot of money for retirement they will be screwed. And from what I see with the cost of living continuing to increased and wages staying almost stagnant we are in for trouble. \n\nThe trouble is a lot of politicians use rental income for passive income so it will hurt them too if they changed the laws. It‚Äôs so wrong that we let people commercialize and profit off the roof over or fellow humans heads.

The intention is to give people looking for a home a better chance of finding one on the tight Dutch housing market. Last year, a third of all homes sold in the four large cities were bought by investors.¬†\n\n>Amsterdam told NOS that if it can, it will use this purchase protection for the entire municipality. Utrecht said the same. \"Especially because we want to prevent a waterbed effect,\" a spokesperson said, referring to investors targeting more expensive homes if they can no longer buy those in the lower segments.¬†\nTilburg is considering implementing the purchase protection in the entire city, The Hague won't rule out that possibility. Groningen is also considering it, but is cautious. \"We are going to see whether we can use the scheme as widely as possible, but we must be able to substantiate that,\" a spokesperson for the municipality of Groningen said to NOS.\n\n>The amendment states that municipalities must \"substantiate whether and in which neighborhoods imbalanced and unjust effects occur due to the scarcity of cheap and medium-priced owner-occupied homes\". The municipalities must also show that the purchase protection is \"necessary and effective\" in the chosen neighborhoods. The amendment does not set a price limit for cheap and medium-priced homes, as a cheap home in Amsterdam can easily cost as much as an expensive one in Groningen, for example. So municipalities will have to set - and explain - the price limits themselves",

It was predicted 4-5 years ago that the average house will make 1 million within 10 years and while we are not there, we are on the way. Find an old newspaper and see what house prices were 10 years ago, 20 years ago, etc and they all hiked but wages have not followed that trend.\n\nThis is just another way to knock down the individual or small business, likely there will not be restrictions on Housing Associations buying, which is what happened in the UK. You might think this is a high and mighty step towards helping the working stiff to get on the property ladder but it won't change the pricing, demand will not lessen to that extent even during the 2008 crash it really only effected higher end houses but the requirements to get a mortgage were laughable. It is harder to get a mortgage today because regulations require stricter proof of affordability. \n\nLack of wage increases, higher costs of living, lack of housing by quantity for rental and ownership are all big factors. Not everyone wants to own nor will everyone be able to their employment and these measures won't make buying a house on minimum wage a possibility. This is treating a symptom under the banner of doing good which will only benefit the few.",

I‚Äôm some dude living the United States that was just curious and it took me 2 seconds to find an article that actually has even an ounce of information, context, and explanation of what is actually happening. I love how this post has awards and likes for posting a spam site that fails to even slightly portray a remotely detailed report of what is really going on. This is such a clever spin to make it a popular idea though, considering that even if people read what is actually happening, they would still only interpret it a way that doesn‚Äôt make them have to confront reality. This is not at all a ban on investors buying homes, it‚Äôs much more a ban on owners selling them. Investors can still do plenty of business outside of the market, while the owners in this market are now banned from selling what they own. The investors will just keep making their money in the markets available while keeping a spreadsheet of homes hitting the 4 year mark. And when they do, the investors will probably even find that they can buy them cheaper from people who would have sold 2 years ago, but had to wait and are now desperate. Anyways, here‚Äôs an article that at least gives a bit of an actual outline of what is really happening. https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2021/09/cities-plan-to-use-new-law-to-block-investors-from-housing-market/",

Everyone who buys a house or apartment, investor or not, has the same effect on the housing market. If anything, property investment is critical for making the housing market fairer, not less fair. The problem is that housings cheaper than it should be, and investors are just taking advantage of this fact, as they should. The alternative is continued and unsustainable ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù of housing.\n\nWe live in an era where there are more and more humans than ever before, demanding more and more space. While a few hundred years ago, the average human used between 0 and 9 meters square of permanent or semi-permanent constructed living space, today we use between 10 and 30 meters square on average. That doesn‚Äôt even take into account all the industrial, office, and retail structures that exist to serve our ever expanding consumerism.\n\nIt‚Äôs time to contract, not grow, or else face the complete destruction of what remains of our real home - the planet Earth - without which we are really no longer human.\n\nDon‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not arguing for greed or the excessive concentration of resources for the few. I am simply arguing that the idea of huge indoor living spaces that we in the Anglophone West have gotten accustomed to is not sustainable, and that we need to start slowly scaling down. It seem that property investment might be a good way to achieve this.",

That's 10% of the market not moving between parent and child, but simply staying with the same fund's balance books.\n\nThey do not need anything as pathetic or paltry as a ‚Ç¨300,000 mortgage, they always buy cash, and so pay less for the same property than the individual buyer. Heck, why wouldn't you just drop a few billion and turn a hundred starter homes into your personal rental empire? \n\nEven more, investment funds have no real incentive to use the homes efficiently. As long as an area doesn't die completely, it might even be advantageous to just mothball even new properties to drive prices up, especially when the profit can be derived from simply waiting for the property market to continue to become even more inaccessible. This goes triple in denser cities which are already facing a housing crisis. \n\nMy favourite part is that this'll end in forced buybacks. Of course, these'll come at market price, meaning that even if you KNOW you're engaging in a practice that will be prohibited as an economic and moral hazard, now is the time to load up on as many properties as possible. \n\nThis might have been preventable should proper taxes on second homes been applied in recent years.
