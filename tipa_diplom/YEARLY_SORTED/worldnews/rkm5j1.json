Killing children? \n\nAll of this literally happens constantly in animal agriculture, all of it your local humans farm is a lie, it‚Äôs all filled with rampant abuse and violation, by design you can‚Äôt forcibly keep someone, and commercially exploit their body and flesh for profit without abusing them, obviously. \n\nLiterally no one is going to force you to go vegan, but this is the actual reality of the situation. Real empathy isn‚Äôt about you or your perception of their suffering as in trying to spare your feelings, it‚Äôs about caring for those who are being truly discriminated against. \n\nImagine if you went to a dog factory farm in china, and you mentioned something about how terrible is it and you heard the same restarted justifications, but remember in this context the general conception is that the person calling out these things is in the wrong. \n\nDo you think peoples feelings about the fact that they‚Äôre directly funding the rape, torture, murder of sentient, intelligent, being with a soul? Into a life of extreme torment and suffering, or the fact that this is happening to the victim is more important? \n\nThis happens directly because of our funding of it, weather you see it or not the reality is the same, and completely unnecessary in feeding the world.",

            "text": "Well, Octopus is an incredibly common food in many cultures. I‚Äôd rather have it ethically farmed than damaging natural populations, as this article states wild caught octopus fishing is actively doing. Pretty much all animals are able to feel pain and emotions in some way. I don‚Äôt know if killing one species is more abhorrent because it‚Äôs intelligence reminds us of things we can do. Maybe all animals feel pain and emotions regardless of if they‚Äôre hunted in the wild or raised on a farm or killed by another natural predator. That‚Äôs a reality of all meat consumption. Personally, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm okay as a part of the natural food cycle. I don‚Äôt see why this is where the line is drawn when Octopus is already widely consumed.\n\nI care about the ecological effects of what I‚Äôm eating and if farming makes food safer to procure, less damaging to natural ecosystems, and more accessible than I don‚Äôt see a problem with it. Those are still ‚Äúifs‚Äù and massive industrial agriculture has problems meeting those ifs but this seems like something that a lot of planning and thought has had to go into and I don‚Äôt see any environmental or ethical hazard to it from this article. It‚Äôs the same animal being killed whether it was reared for that purpose or not. I‚Äôd rather them be consumed this way than to strip natural populations as our human population grows because it‚Äôs more ‚Äúhonorable‚Äù. Agriculture is necessary to support growing civilization and when done with care can be a massive tool for conservation",

Even insects are capable of individual experience (history/personality dictating choices that are radically different from the choices of individuals of the same species even while under identical circumstances). Individual experience is one of the hallmarks of sentience. \n\nThird: There are living creatures without central nervous systems that are capable of having individual experiences. Slime molds, for instance, interact with the world based on stored memories (knowledge of what is beneficial vs. what is painful/wasteful).\n\nFourth: It is *probably* impossible for us to rear any living being to be food while also avoiding the consumption of sentient life, because if slime molds are potentially sentient than there is no reason why grains might also have their own unique type of sentience.\n\nFive: There is no such thing as ethical consumption, therefore any ethical arguments against the raising of cephalopods as food items is irrelevant. Livestock, chickens, etc. are all sentient and capable of feeling pain, but mass-farming is something humanity relies on.\n\nSix: okay but octopi are too cool for this",

Even if technologically possible, would it be a win to give animals without high level critical thinking CIPA? Would it be better to create intentionally neurocrippled animals? Could we make an animal that naturally sheds edible meat like a fruit tree (octopuses can already voluntarily abandon and regrow a limb for example)?

As far as we know plants have no known sentience by themselves (no CNS analogue), so that make an ethically preferable food source. If im staring at wheat or a \"ham\"burger made of vegetal proteins, it doesn't feel like the plate can argue about said lunch when you think about where it's coming from.\n\nIt's like when nike was having children manufacturing their shoes, or disneyland forgot to pay their employees a living.

My biggest issue is how these animals are cared for; factory farmed animals have constantly been put on blast as it gives below basic husbandry at the expensive of the animal's lively-hood. Alternative methods have been shown to be more beneficial, especially in the argument for climate change and overall byproducts of the meat industry, yet these caretakers don't want to change as their current method yields the cheapest expenses for them along with the highest gains. This argument as well also goes for all types of farms such as fish and plants: we as a society should push to have better options and methods and we can do them....its just everyone is more interested in doing the bare minimum for the maximum profit at the expense of the animals (or the land for the case of plants), the workers, and overall the planet.",
