Still no one surrenders, because they want to connect to western economy and politics. They believe in this. Don’t forget that Ukraine gave up their nuclear arsenal in 90s, to signal a change of direction. Several major countries gave guarantees for Ukrainian safety. Including Russia.

Commander of the encircled town of Bastogne.\nThe fortune of war is changing. This time the U.S.A. forces in and near Bastogne have been encircled by strong German armored units. More German armored units have crossed the river Ourthe near Ortheuville, have taken Marche and reached St. Hubert by passing through Hompre-Sibret-Tillet. Libramont is in German hands.\nThere is only one possibility to save the encircled U.S.A. troops from total annihilation: that is the honorable surrender of the encircled town. In order to think it over a term of two hours will be granted beginning with the presentation of this note.\nIf this proposal should be rejected one German Artillery Corps and six heavy A. A. Battalions are ready to annihilate the U.S.A. troops in and near Bastogne. The order for firing will be given immediately after this two hours term.\nAll the serious civilian losses caused by this artillery fire would not correspond with the well-known American humanity.\nThe German Commander.”\n\nGeneral McAuliffe’s reply was a little shorter:\n\n“To the German Commander.\nNUTS!\nThe American Commander.”\n\nThese men are heroes and so are the 13 Ukrainians who’d died in defiance of tyranny. Enjoy Valhalla, you’ve all earned it. \n\nAlso, RUSSIA GO FUCK YOURSELF 🥜",

I thought he was crazy because he was telling that Russians killed his brother . \n\nNow I see they were exactly right .

I wish they would have surrendered as there did not seem to be anything to gain. I understand it if a large Russian infantry group was coming and they put up a fight knowing they would not win, but would at least cut down some of the enemy army. \n\nPeople talk about morale, but there are other situations that can be celebrated. The story of the marine who sacrificed himself to blew up a bridge to prevent tanks from advancing should be held up with high regard. How many stories to boost morale do you need? Would the island story really boost morale? Or would it make people question their leadership if it moves from a fight to a slaughter? \n\nAlso I have no doubt there would be risk becoming a POW under russian forces, but im not sure what evidence there is to assume they will be killed. There will likely be a large amount of POWs. It's not like they are finding a handful of traitors and will execute them. I think the international response would be far worse for the russians if they just start doing mass executions.",
