What will that baby even eat? Do you prefer them to suffer from hunger and trash life for years? Do you think you can force adoption centers to take them? Who pays to feed them? Do you donate each month like $100 to those adoption centers so they can take care for the babies from those homeless or destroyed financially women? Or do you only want to make the abortion illegal and do absolutely zero shit else about what forcing every woman to have a baby implies and the problems it creates? A baby is extremely expensive and time consuming. Will you pay for it and the time of someone to take care of him?\n\nIs the weeks of life of a fetus (bunch of cells, no brain yet) worth more than two fully grown adults who already made a difference in this world but will get their whole life completely destroyed financially by an accidental pregnancy?\n\nA mother who doesnt want their baby will never love him and will never be a good mother. Are you sure you want to feel responsive for a life that will never have mothers love? That fetus will probably commit suicide at 15 for a huge depression, the life will be lost anyway, just after it already made a difference in this world. Are you ok with this?\n\nIf you were, RIGHT NOW, forced to have a baby, and I dont want to hear any argument, i just throw a newly born baby on to your hands right now, you would probably abandon school or/and quit your job NOW because the baby needs 24/7 care, no income because you quit but having to buy $500-$1000 of stuff and care and pediatric things to the baby, I hope you then, with your financially life destroyed, feel happy about being forced to have the baby you didnt want.\n\nKids are stupid and do stupid shit. Would you force a 13 years old girl to have a baby after they got pregnant? Have their teens life destroyed? Early adult life destroyed? Father probably gone? It happens more than you think. If you are ok with forcing this, you are the one to blame for the destruction of this little girl's life.\n\nAll I said will probably never happen, because guess what, women are going to have the abortion anyway. If they cant have it legally, safely, stress free in an abortion center, then they will have it by force, by risking her own lives, in undergrownd illegal abortion clinics with zero safety and zero hygiene. Going back to medieval times. Making it legal will make it safe. Or they will just travel to other countries or states and do it there, like most do anyway. You cant stop women from aborting, just harrass them and be a dick about it.\n\nAnd lets never forget about women that got raped and got pregnant. Its a very traumatizing pregnancy to be forced to go through.\n\nAll you people love to brag about \"omg its a human life, human rights\" but no one actually wants to commit to the implications created by forcing a baby on someone completely unprepared for it.",

But it remains to be seen if those pro-lifers are really going to face consequences.\n\nThis topic and also removing a paragraph of the abortion law that punished doctors to give out information about abortion on their website was part of the election program of the Green party in Germany.\nPro-lifers went bat shit crazy about it \"How dare you to take away our right to \"peacefully\" protest against abortions!\" \n\nIn truth they attacked people going into a clinic that also does abortion on top of other non-abortion services. \n\nThe attacks ranged from shouting insults, tearing at hair, throwing rotten food at women up to outright stalking, life threats and stabbing. Even doctors who were known to do abortions had to deal with attacks or damage to their property. Most of these pro-lifers were women.\n\nYes, that's what's going on in Germany...\nSo I am kinda happy for women in Spain! \n\nI am also glad I never was in a situation to have need of an abortion. With those POSs around, I most likely would have taken 2 weeks of annual leave and gone directly to Netherlands and having everything done there. They are kinda very civilized about that. \n\nPlus, way too many aspiring doctors for women's health in Germany shy away from learning how to perform an abortion with modern less painful methods because of the legal hassle and threats from those militant Pro-lifers.",

I don't think I've ever been so angry in my life, before or since.\n\nThey treated her like she was just a slut who gets abortions all willy-nilly.  Everybody I've ever met that went through that said it was one of the hardest decisions they ever made and that it was very upsetting even years later.
