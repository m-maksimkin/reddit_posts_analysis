Israel needs to immediately remove all the settlers from the West Bank and needs to stop the building of illegal settlements. Every illegal settlement in East Jerusalem needs to be dismantled and with all settlers removed immediately. Every single discriminatory policy against non-Jews by the state of Israel needs to be revoked. Bedouin communities (~90k people) must be recognized by Israel and so must their villages. \n\nThe International Criminal Court is investigating your crimes against humanity, Israel.
