And most people are against regimes that oppress and and are violent towards their population. With the conflict that’s going on right now in Ukraine though, there’s this odd want for death on the Russian side of things from most onlookers. I don’t agree with their invasion in the slightest and hope for a swift end to the conflict myself. \nBut as someone with not a lot of direction in life and someone who has considered military service as an option for my future it’s odd to me hearing cheers and calls from people toward military successes when they would otherwise despise and dismiss military action altogether. At what point is violence and a military good and respectable? Certainly defending one’s home is reason enough to pick up arms. But forward military action abroad is almost always universally looked down upon. Is the only good military one that defends a homeland? Is attacking with a military ever good for any reason? Is upholding one in the first place a bad thing by nature? \nAt this point this is just a flow of consciousness and questions with answers that can’t definitively exist but I thought I’d air them because they’re chewing me up inside.

Perhaps that is why his public appearances have lessened and he uses prerecorded messages. Watching closely I see many similarities to my father's progressive Parkinsonia disease that eventually took his life. Maybe I'm just reaching idk. The sun says Putin has cancer and had emergency surgery last year in September. I don't know how true that is. But I see signs of muscle atrophy and his thinning face.

For example, NATO is expanding into the Ukraine, even though it is a breach of agreement.\n\nNow that Russia sees NATO breaching their agreements, Russia have said they're stepping in to stop the killing of pro-Russian Ukrainians. The Russians had gotten involved in two situations against 'western' Ukrainians before, and now say they are backing the 'eastern' Russian-speaking Ukrainians in order for Luhansk and Donetsk to become an independent state.\n\nMore than 80% of the casualties of this war have been in Luhansk. In addition, 'Western' Ukraine has been using neo-nazi militant groups like Azov to attack Russians in Luhansk and Donetsk, so that doesn't really help their image, and gives Putin political leverage.

The Russian military also controls several airfields it can use to funnel more forces into the country.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is believed to be aiming to control all of Ukraine, although military actions have so far been concentrated in the east, south and center of the country, the official said. Putin’s end game is seen as removing the government in Kyiv to install a puppet regime. \n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has vowed to defend his country and insisted that he and his government will remain in the capital. The official said that the city of 3 million people could suffer extreme violence as the Russians take control.\n\nRead More: U.S. Spies Made Right Call on Russia Invasion, Buying Biden Time\n\nThe initial wave of Russia’s attack on Ukraine involved 75 heavy and medium bombers and more than 100 missiles of various types, according to a U.S. defense official who briefed reporters. \n\nUkraine’s State Border Guard Service said its personnel came under attack at 5 a.m. local time in five provinces ranged around the country’s northeastern borders, as well as through Donbas and occupied Crimea, to the south.\n\nRussian tanks were reported to have reached the outskirts of Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, by mid-morning, and to be fighting in the Kherson region just north of Crimea. By early afternoon, CNN showed Russian troops apparently in control of Hostomel airport, outside Kyiv, following an air assault.\n\nMykhaylo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskiy, suggested Russian forces were trying to secure the base as a bridgehead for an operation to decapitate the government. “Landing of airborne troops is possible. There could be an attempt to enter the government’s bloc,” Podolyak said. “One of the goals is to remove top authorities.”\n\nIn an unequal battle -- Russia spends more than 10 times as much on defense -- Ukraine said it had shot down Russian aircraft and destroyed tanks and was holding firm along a long eastern front. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it had destroyed 74 military facilities, including 11 air fields, 3 command posts, a naval base and 18 radar stations for anti-aircraft batteries.\n\nSource: Bloomberg terminal",

Especially with such a large reserve of troops still on the bench so to speak.
