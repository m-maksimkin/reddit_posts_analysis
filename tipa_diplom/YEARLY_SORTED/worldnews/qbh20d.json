Perhaps this can be performed from a blockchain infrastructure that can be semi decentralized system.\n\nUBI sounds awesome, but it all depends on how the taxes are collected in an indiscriminate fashion. We know the monopoly game is over when large corporations and governments collude to maintain the most buying power through corruption. The Keynesian system allows for inflation to keep the party going, meanwhile currencies are flat out debased and the little guy can never catch up, but at least its a system that has been beneficial, but now it appears to be outdated.\n\nThe petrol dollar was a good move for the U.S., but it has caused a lot of conflict through out the world ie Iraq and Venezuela. I got to give some props to the bitcoin/crypto bois  by moving away from consuming fossil fuels with the El Salvador and Iceland by adopting sustainable energy and moving, thus  away from the petrol dollar. Perhaps in the next 5-10 years from now, an Apolitical financial organization can further disrupt the monetary system by finding a way to indiscriminately re-distribute currency depending on power consumption/GDP/population growth among other factors.",

            "text": "I run a painting business in Australia, I work 6 to 7 hours a day starting early and finish early with a brief half hour brake to eat and escape the heat. We work 5 days a week with a rare 4 hours on Saturday if needed. Being 31 years old running a business doing short hours is very different to the norm where I am from, generally someone in the construction industry would do at least 10 hours a day 6 days a week. Some times I feel I am a fraud not working as long as everyone else does, yet I do believe we are far more productive and everyone is far happier doing it my way. Get in, get it done and go home to enjoy your life, not toil away looking busy just work hard and fuck off. I hope that one day people will work less hours and enjoy thier lives doing what they love yet still doing essential work that is needed to run society.",
