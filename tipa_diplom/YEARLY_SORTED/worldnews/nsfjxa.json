One and the same, just older terminology. As I mentioned I have preferred not using Microsoft products to do internet searches for 20 years. If someone uses terminology you are unfamiliar with , google it, use Wikipedia , DuckDuckGo , most internet browsers /  search engines have these wonderful tools that will even offer up a dictionary definition. If those fail use urban dictionary, also very useful. Expand your horizons, you might learn something. And remember the terminology you use will be obsolete in 5 years too. Just sayin’",

(there has been some seemingly harmless news on this recently)\n\nThe paid chinese accounts will stupidly argue there is nothing nefarious in working with these chinese for research (lol). Maybe one should ask themselves if it is completely normal for a rich american to be so keen on rubbing shoulders and bootlicking the chinese.\n\nAlso Gates is set be the supplier of a particular food to chinese soldiers in Africa. This scientific food is not supposed to fall into the hands of local african people or other outsiders. \n\nFor you and I, collaborating with the enemy is cleary unthinkable. But that shit-stain has sold himself for more money and influence. Gates is not the harmless smiling man he has portrayed himself to be. He is a traitor, nothing less.",

The problem is that no one at MS was actively looking for this kind of interference.  They need to audit and purge.  Just saying it was \"human error\" is ridiculous.  It wasn't an error, it was sabotage.  There should even be civil or criminal charges, but I'm sure they won't.  Management must be aware of the CCP group.",
