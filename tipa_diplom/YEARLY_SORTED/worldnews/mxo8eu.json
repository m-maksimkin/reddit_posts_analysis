When Nazi hollocost happened, Turkish diplomat saved thousands of Jewish people. They even created fake passports to save more people. \nDurin Spanish inquisition, the Otttoman Sultan Süleyman sent ships to save Jewish people and located them in Turkey. \nI don't like Erdoğan.

The events of 1915 was very unfortunate, but one should not make it equal with the Nazi genocide. \nThis recognition  actually worsen a future peace and collaboration with Armenia. \n\nFinal question - Is Biden going to reconize Armenians massacre in Hojali as genocide? Is there a spesific number to consider events of killing as a genocide. When you self defence yourself from a civil war and relocated your people into other areas in your country and some lose their lives due to climate, diseases and bandit attacks, is it a genocide?

One of the things I found fascinating about the novel, although written just as Hitler assumed power, was how the techniques the Turkish government used to isolate, displace, and round up the Armenians were eerily similar to those used in the next decade by the Nazis against the Jews. When I first read it, I was sure it had been written in the 1940s, because the actions were so similar. The book was condemned by the Nazis and, along with being Jewish, he was forced to leave Germany when Nazis took over and moved to southern France. When the Nazis occupied France in WWII, Werfel narrowly escaped into Spain, Portugal, and ultimately, the United States. He died in 1945. In 2006, he was granted honorary Armenian citizenship.",

Of course, Armenian people cared about what happened to them in past, Uighurs cares about what’s happening to them, Indians care about what happened to them. What I meant is that for everyone else (who has not suffered pain) someone’s suffering has become a political tool. Does America really care what happened to Armenian people or is it just using Armenian genocide as a political tool to counter Turkey. Uighur genocide is happening since more then a decade, why is US just recognising it now, it’s because US is using it as a tool to counter rising China.\nIn Bangladesh Liberation War(1971) US actively supported the perpetrator (Pakistan) which resulted in genocide of about 2-3 million people. But US didn’t cared and sent Battlegroups to support Pakistan, all this because Pakistan was an important ally against USSR.\n\nPoint I am trying to make is that people die, people suffer, and then their death is used as a political tool.",

            "text": "So, there are questions in this thread and in others about why this genocide was recognized so late and why other similar genocides have yet to be recognized by the United States. As a lawyer working in international law, I wrote what I hope to be at least a partial answer. Unfortunately, the history is fairly complicated and generally poorly explained by news articles. **TL;DR**: The answer is two-fold, and explains why all countries are hesitant to declare certain actions genocide even within countries otherwise unimportant to their foreign policy. First, a declaration of genocide obliges the declarant to act to stop the genocide. Second, and most remarkable in the current case, the declaration forever helps define what the declaring country considers genocide.\n\n\nIn any case, and for the record, this declaration reflects the settled legal reality that this genocide absolutely and legally was a genocide.\n\n\n***First: The Erga Omnes Obligation***\n\n\nTo understand the first prong, it is necessary to understand the legal concept of *erga omnes*. An *erga omnes* obligation is an obligation that all countries owe to each other and to the world, and is a label generally ascribed to the most important obligations (called *jus cogens*) which the prevention of genocide is. It gives any country in the world standing in an international court when a violation of an *erga omnes* obligation occurs and another country does not stop it. It therefore gives all states the rights to invoke state responsibility for the other country’s failure to contain the genocide (very basically, state responsibility is similar to paying damages, *see* the ILC’s report on state responsibility, linked below). This means that states that do not perform their *erga omnes* obligation when it is their universal responsibility to do so open themselves up to claims internationally. *Erga Omnes* obligations were recognized by the International Court of Justice in [*Barcelona Traction*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/50/050-19700205-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) at para 33:\n\n\n> When a State admits into its territory foreign investments or foreign nationals, whether natural or juristic persons, it is bound to extend to them the protection of the law and assumes obligations concerning the treatment to be afforded them. These obligations, however, are neither absolute nor unqualified. In particular, an essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole, and those arising vis-à-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By their very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations *erga omnes*.\n\n\nThe prevention of genocide as *erga omnes* was recognized by the International Law Commission of the United Nations through it’s [*Draft articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/9_6_2001.pdf) at page 111 where it states:\n\n\n> essential distinction should be drawn between the obligations of a State towards the international community as a whole, and those arising vis-à-vis another State in the field of diplomatic protection. By their very nature the former are the concern of all States. In view of the importance of the rights involved, all States can be held to have a legal interest in their protection; they are obligations erga omnes…  At the preliminary objections stage of the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide case, it stated that “the rights and obligations enshrined by the [Genocide] Convention are rights and obligations erga omnes” this finding contributed to its conclusion that its temporal jurisdiction over the claim was not limited to the time after which the parties became bound by the Convention.\n\n\nThe idea that genocide is an obligation *erga omnes* formally brought into law in the 1996 [*Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Yugoslavia*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/91/091-19960711-JUD-01-00-EN.pdf) PMO decision when the court, through an analysis of the purpose of the *Genocide Convention* found the prevention of genocide to be an obligation *erga omnes*. That said, in paragraph 31, it said something very interesting: \n\n\n> \"The origins of the Convention show that it was the intention of the United Nations to condemn and punish genocide as 'a crime under international law' involving a denial of the right of existence of entire human groups, a denial which shocks the conscience of mankind and results in great losses to humanity, and which is contrary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations. The first consequence arising from this conception is that the principles underlying the Convention are principles which are recognized by civilized nations as binding on States, even without any conventional obligation. A second consequence is the universal character both of the condemnation of genocide and of the CO-operation required 'in order to liberate mankind from such an odious scourge' (Preamble to the Convention).\" It follows that the rights and obligations enshrined by the Convention are rights and obligations erga omnes. ***The Court notes that the obligation each State thus has to prevent and to punish the crime of genocide is not territorially limited by the Convention.*** [emphasis added]\n\n\nThis was made even more explicit in the [*The Gambia v. Myanmar*](https://www.icj-cij.org/public/files/case-related/178/178-20200123-ORD-01-00-EN.pdf) where the court said at para 41:\n\n\n> The Court held that these provisions generated “obligations [which] may be defined as ‘obligations erga omnes partes’ in the sense that each State party has an interest in compliance with them in any given case” (Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2012 (II), p. 449, para. 68). It follows that any State party to the Genocide Convention, and not only a specially affected State, **may invoke the responsibility of another State party with a view to ascertaining the alleged failure to  comply with its obligations erga omnes partes, and to bring that failure to an end.** [emphasis added]\n\n\nThe parts that I have emphasized are a formal recognition that each state has an actual obligation to do something to prevent genocide in the case that an occurrence of e genocide exists, and as it is an *erga omnes* obligation, a state that recognizes a genocide, is in a position to help stop that genocide, but refuses to do so, has breached its *erga omnes* obligations and other states may invoke state responsibility over them for their failure to act. That is one of a few major reasons that states are hesitant to recognize genocides; **they may be bound to act to stop that genocide if they so declare one.**\n\n\n***Second: the Application of the Genocide Convention***\n\n\nOne of the most important instruments in international law is the [*Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*](https://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/1_1_1969.pdf). This treaty under Article 31(3)(b) on the general principles of interpretation states: \n\n\n> 3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context: (b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\n\n\nThe [*Genocide Convention*](https://www.un.org/en/genocideprevention/documents/atrocity-crimes/Doc.1_Convention%20on%20the%20Prevention%20and%20Punishment%20of%20the%20Crime%20of%20Genocide.pdf) under Article II states: \n\n\n> In the present Convention, genocide means any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:\n> (a) Killing members of the group;\n> (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;\n> (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;\n> (d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;\n> (e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\n\nThe essence of these clauses is that the treatment of Genocide under the Genocide Convention compounds in on itself. While genocide is defined, there is not currently a list of actual specific actions undertaken by states that constitute genocide, which would be extremely helpful because according to the article you have to prove that the there was *intent* to destroy the group, which is based on actions and statements (there are many cases that speak to this requirement).\n\n\nIf the global community generally considers something to be genocide, then that thing that it considers genocide will gradually become indicative of the crime of genocide. Thus, countries risk creating legal situation where genocide becomes what they have declared it to be. While that sounds great, it also risks having the crime of genocide become meaningless as countries are willing to declare it whenever they suspect it, and thus gradually bring the net of behaviour that the genocide convention catches wider. The reason that this is a bad thing is that, as mentioned genocide’s *erga omnes* status is extremely serious and obliges states to act. A loose genocide definition actually makes the world *less* stable and makes states *worse* at preventing that genocide as genocide begins to mean less. Again, this comment is **not** meant to defend any country that shrinks away from its responsibilities.\n\n\nIn sum, international law makes the declaration of genocide a lot harder than base concerns about diplomacy (which absolutely still exist) and is actually much more complicated than people realize.",

This isn’t some kind of Trump apologia, or even really all that motivated by a political agenda. I’ll admit that I’m probably farther left than most users here, and because of that this is something that I probably have been paying way more attention to than your average person. \n\n\nThis isn’t a knock on Biden for talking about it (which as far as I know, Trump never did), it’s just that I really am uneasy at how the media is seemingly conflating Biden speaking about it with the USA’s recognition of it. I don’t think they anyone should stop talking about this, I don’t think Trump was good or anything, it’s just they the way this whole story is being handled is leaving a very bad taste in my mouth",
