Sanctions most of  the people responsible for this invasion will probably give no shits about. Its like how health insurance companies in the united states run themselves. As an example, kaiser permanente - they know they're going to get sued if they don't offer proper mental health care. However the fines they receive if they don't offer it are less than the money saved from not offering it. So at the end of the day, it makes more financial sense to not offer good healthcare. This is what's happening in Russia. Putin and his supporting oligarchs are set more to benefit from this invasion then they are lose from the resulting sanctions. So NATO, threatening sanctions is a hilariously weak move.\n\nWhat's even worse though, NATO is effectively saying \"stop don't do it or we'll be angry\". THATS IT. that's all they're doing. Why they  haven't put boots on the ground or done anything actually meaningful to stop this invasion, especially when they've had so much time to do so -- that's what I want to know.

Several states vote to secede and the US is this time powerless to stop them so they go along with it. America loses 20-30% of its territory and 50% of its population.\n\nThree decades later the soviets have turned Mexico and many other countries in latin America into Warsaw Pact members. \n\nThe US meanwhile has recovered somewhat but still has an economy smaller than that of Italy and is very politically isolated, with its only allies being former US states. They have spent most of their post war years investing their military budget on nuclear weapons as they can no longer fight massive full scale conflicts. They now have the largest arsenal.\n\nAs for the soviets, they have also gotten Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico to join their alliance. But now they choose to invite Texas to join as well. The US says absolutely not. \n\nCould you imagine the United States government officials allowing a former mainland US state like Texas to join a rival alliance which could then use that state to deploy nuclear warheads and mass troops right on the US border? What about the same officials in charge during the Cuban missile crisis?\n\nWould the soviets be justified to continue pushing for an alliance with Texas and risk nuclear war? \n\nNow obviously no comparison is perfect and there are obviously some big differences between the two scenarios. But the core aspects, and in particular the way Putin views this crisis is very similar to how this setting is portrayed.",

It is not sensible to call your civilians for war in a conflict between proffesional armies.

The Oligarchs at the end of the day will still profit both from war and the spoils of war.\n\nI work for one of the top companies in IT and we contract out a lot of work to Russia. I asked my boss what would happen if Russia invades? Answer - business as usual. This is a small example that business will continue on as usual behind the scenes away from the public eye. Lets not forget Russia has been under massive sanctions for 8 years after the invasion of Crimea and further sanctions after the Navalny poisoning. It hurt them but not much. If they really want to hurt Russia they would reduce exports and restrict access to internal banking systems - both of these measures dont look to be implemented. And the reason why is that EU is reliant on Russia energy exports. Half of EU natural gas comes from Russia. We somehow get ourselves in a position to be reliant on despot states.

In reality, Ukraine lost them back in 2014. So, Ukraine doesn't really loose anything, but surely will get huge financial and military support from US and EU.\n\nFor Donetsk and Lugansk, \"Ukraine separatist provinces\", Russian invasion is also total win. Majority of its population favors Russia, people also tired of civil war. They will greet Russian troops as their saviors, who will defend them from evil Ukrainian army, which bombed their homes and killed their people for 8 years. Also, they will receive huge financial help from russian government, same as it was for Crimea.\n\nRor US it is also win. US now have great reason for sanctions against Russia, which helps US to take some new markets in Europe.\n\nFor EU it is total loss. They will be forced by US to accept sanctions and lose some profitable trade deals with Russia. EU probably will try to limit sanctions to minimal level and save as much trading connections with Russia as possible.\n\nFor Russia it is half win and half loss. Russia get new territories with very loyal population and lot of natural resources. Also, majority of russian people like idea of getting back territories, belonged to Russia before collapse of Soviet Union, so invasion will make positive effect for Putin's political rating. On the other side, western sanctions and their negative effect for Russian economy.\n\nAnd I doubt there will be many casualties. Ukraine won't attack Russia, and Russian army won't move further Donetsk and Lugansk.",

Russia declares thousands of square miles of Ukraine, no longer Ukraine, then sends Russian troops across the border on a \"Peacekeeping Mission\" (which is literally a military invasion of Ukraine)?\n\nSo by that methodology, Russia is waiting to flank with the troops stationed on the Northern border? Which means Russia has excuse to send troops into Ukraine across the northern border now that Ukraine started the war with Russia by sending troops into the territories Russia unrightfully claimed no longer belonged to the Ukrain because Ukraine was responding to a literal russian invasion (their \"peacekeeping mission\")? Or are they doing this to pull Ukrainian troops off the northern border so they can march down to Kiev and up from Crimea?\n\nThey already have troops on the northern border. They are ensuring _some_ Ukrainian troops move to the Eastern border. They closed down the Sea of Azov by Crimea, a sea between Ukraine and Russia, probably to move troops across it into Crimea then up from there.\n\nThat means Russian troops will come from the North, the East, and the South. \n\nThe ONLY thing they want is Kyiv, the Capital of Ukraine, and by proxy the _entire_ Ukraine landmass, to rejoine with Russia.\n\nThis was their plan since the first assholes landed in Crimea 8 years ago. This has been planned a long time there is no denying it.\n\nThey want absolute uninterrupted access to the Black Sea _by land_ and the resources in the \"resource rich\" eastern Ukraine. Putin played his whole hand out when he was trying to delegitamize Ukraine's success earlier today. He called eastern Ukraine resource rich and tried to say that the Ukrainian economy and country itself is poorly run and creating a poor life for its people in the same damn breath.\n\nRussia for years is moving closer to a failed state every year and Putin thinks Ukraine (and probably some other eastern European nations) have the resources Russia needs to climb back up the latter towards relevancy on the world stage. He is banking he can get it done in the Ukraine before sanctions kill his country and that, if he does, he can hold off long enough to dream up some equally nutty plans for elsewhere.\n\nThat's why Russia is so opposed to NATO expansion to the East. It is not about respecting sovereignty of countries, it's because he wants to invade Eastern European countries to build Russia back up, but those countries belong to NATO, and by literal law and treaty, a massive western alliance he cant hope to ever defeat.",

            "text": "From missionaries to the Ukraine:  February 2022:\n\nProverbs 25:25 As cold water to a weary soul, So is good news from a far country. Dear Friends,\nWe are alive and well in Ukraine. We are so grateful for all of you who have been praying for us, and we have been encouraged by many of you writing to tell us of your concern and how you are standing with us in prayer. Surely, through your intercession at the throne of grace we have been obtaining mercy and finding grace to help in time of need (Hebrews 4:16).\nIt should come as no shock if I tell you that you can’t trust much of what you see or read in the media. There is so much that is hype and hyperbole and partial truths or outright lies that it is really hard to know what to believe. So let me give you my perspective.\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine is not imminent, it happened in 2014. Since that time there have been close to 40,000 casualties, with the number of Ukrainians killed at more than 14,000. Close to 2 million people have been displaced. Contrary to many reports, most people are not fleeing to Russia but are moving to the west to the capital city of Kiev and other cities or other European countries in many cases. The US State Department has been issuing Level 3 and Level 4 threat warnings for more than seven years now. What is happening now is not something new.\nIt is true that there has been a large Russian military build-up all around Ukraine – on the eastern border, on the northern border in Belarus, in the south in the Crimean Peninsula, and in the west in the Transnistria region. No one knows for sure if this has any real significance or if it is just grand theater being produced for Putin’s aggrandizement. It may be that he is doing a lot of posturing in order to achieve political goals that do not include a full-scale of Ukraine at all.\nLet me tell you what I observe in Ukraine. In the Donbas region of southeastern Ukraine several cities are under the control of Russian separatists. There have been continuing skirmishes for years between these Russian-backed forces and the Ukrainian military, accounting for the casualties mentioned above. However, for the most part, Ukrainians are not living in fear of an all-out assault.\nI have traveled to many place around the country, and except in that one region there is no indication of a country on the brink of war. And except in that region a person can travel freely by car or public transportation without being stopped at checkpoints. There are no soldiers or military vehicles along the way. I have flown domestically into and out of cities in Ukraine with no problems, no increased scrutiny at the airports.\n\nIn the capital city of Kiev the airports are open, with more concern about the Corona virus than a military invasion. There are no long lines at the airports with people frantically leaving the country. In fact, the last couple of times that we have flow into Ukraine recently, the incoming planes were full. Apparently people are not afraid to come here. There are no special forces at the airports or along the highways. Businesses are open and there is no evidence of panic buying. The shelves are fully stocked. There are no long lines at the gas stations. Churches are not overflowing with people cowering in fear because of a perception of imminent danger. People are not huddled in their homes and we hear little talk of war. By all appearances Ukraine does not look like a country that is unduly alarmed by all of the news coming out of the US and western Europe.\nObviously things could change rapidly. We have no way of knowing if they will. We receive notices from the US Embassy here, almost daily, warning us to leave the country immediately. I have even received telephone calls from the State Department in Washington to ask if we are still in Ukraine, and, if so, do we plan to evacuate. The last time they called I asked if they had some information that was different from what I could get from the media, and they said no. So I want to know what has changed in the past week or month or year?\nThere are some who are making decisions based more on fear than fact. KLM airline has suspended all of its flights in and out of Ukraine because their insurers have refused to cover any losses that might be sustained due to a war. This results in economic loss both for them and for Ukraine. Other companies headquartered in the West have also suspended working here. This has also had some impact on the economy here. As you have probably heard a couple of countries, including the US have pulled their embassy staff out of the country. But the vast majority have not done so.\nWe are not oblivious to the potential danger, and we have considered what steps we might need to take in the event of war. We have some food stockpiled, some gasoline and a power generator. We know where the border crossings are should it be necessary to leave. But we have no plans at present to evacuate. In fact, we do not anticipate leaving unless forced to do so. Our thinking is this: what kind of example would we be, what testimony of faith in the Lord, if we tell our people to trust in the Lord and then we bail out at the first hint of trouble? This is our life, our ministry, our home – until the Lord moves us!\nPlease continue to pray for Ukraine, for its leaders to have wisdom, for its military to have courage, for its people to turn to the Lord in their hour of testing. Pray for us that we can continue to preach the gospel, to keep on training our Bible college students to prepare them for ministry. It is our privilege, our joy to serve the Lord here.\nI will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in Him I will trust.\nPsalms 92:2\nJim and Phyllis",

For Russia, control of Ukraine isn’t simply seen as a birthright, but as an issue of national survival. The Russian population suffers so completely from drug abuse, alcoholism, malnutrition, and disease that it is the world’s fastest collapsing demography (although recent statistical updates suggest China is challenging Russia for the top spot). Patrolling Russia’s current borders is laughably beyond the capacity of Russia’s current population. But forward-positioning what troops remain in those gateways? That just might work. So, the Russians will try.\n\nAbout the only would-be sanction which might - might - earn a blink from the Kremlin would be if the Europeans all swore off Russian oil and natural gas. That export line-item is far and away the Russian government’s largest money-maker, accounting for a hefty majority of income. But in doing so the Europeans would be cutting off their primary energy provider, condemning themselves to the dark and cold. And so that specific threat hasn’t happened. I’d be impressed - and shocked - if it did.\n\nI’d be equally shocked if the fall of Ukraine were the end of the story. Ukraine is not a NATO ally. The West will not send regular troops to support Ukraine. That makes Ukraine - with its 45-million-strong population - the easy target. What assistance arrives will be designed to snarl the Russians in as painful and bloody of an occupation as possible. The real show - the real war - comes after. The two most important gateways to the Russian heartland remain: the Baltic Sea coast and the portion of the gap that lies in Poland. Unlike Ukraine, the countries in question here - Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - are members of the NATO alliance. And of the European Union as well.\n\nThe Baltic beaches and the plains of Poland are where the future of Russia and the West, of the European Union and NATO, will ultimately be decided. It is there that Russia will succeed or die. This is far worse than it sounds. Russia’s population is in free-fall. A Russian occupation of Ukraine completed to Russia’s satisfaction will still absorb most of what’s left of Russia’s conventional military capabilities, leaving only the decidedly unconventional available for the next conflict.",

He has to make sure the conflict doesn't stop until his new Russo-Chinese alliance also has provisions for energy exports from Russia to China. So the new Eurasian Forces will be Russia/China/Pakistan/Iran basically vs Everyone else.  \nTrump was never the endgame. Ukraine was the endgame. Russian Eurasianism was the endgame. Putin put Trump in so he would keep the US and NATO out of Russia's way when it finally pulled the trigger on Ukraine. Hell, Trump said PUBLICLY he trusted Putin over his own 6 intelligence agencies. He got impeached trying to stop military aid to Ukraine. Putin had no reason to think Trump wouldn't get reelected. Imagine if Trump were president now? At best he'd be pulling funding, troops and materiel from NATO, at worst he'd be calling for outright aid to Russia.  \nNow that the Olympics are over and Russia is moving on Ukraine, look for China to manufacture an excuse to invade Taiwan- probably a downed jet they keep flying over Taiwan. The west can't respond to both threats at once. The US and Japan will mobilize against China in the South China Sea and Europe will be busy with Russia in the east.  \nWelcome to World War III.",

At the same time Russia was occupying [Crimea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Republic_of_Crimea) and [Sevastopol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sevastopol), it was supplying military aid to rebel groups in Donetsk and Luhansk, designated by Ukraine as terrorist organizations. If you remember the [Malaysian Airlines flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Airlines_Flight_17) that was shot down over Ukraine in the summer of 2014, that was done by separatists in Donetsk.\n\nSince then, the rebel groups have formed unrecognized states [Donetsk People's Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donetsk_People%27s_Republic) and [Luhansk People's Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhansk_People%27s_Republic) that have *de facto* control of most of the area in the provinces. A [peace agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minsk_Protocol#Minsk_II) in 2015 was intended to stop the fighting and return the area controlled by DPR and LPR to Ukraine in exchange for greater autonomy, but this largely failed to be implemented.\n\nIn January 2021 the leaders of DPR and LPR pledged to take over all of Donbas \"in the near future\".\n\nNow Russia, which has been giving aid to DPR/LPR since 2014 and has issued Russian passports to residents there since 2019, has officially recognized DPR/LPR as independent countries. Russia has ordered troops to DPR/LPR (which is legally Ukrainian territory so this is an invasion), with the obviously false pretext of protecting DPR/LPR against threats by Ukraine.\n\nWhat happens next is not too hard to guess. In 2014, Russia recognized Crimea and Sevastopol as independent countries before annexing them, thinking that this would legitimize the annexation. So Russia will probably follow the same playbook in Donetsk and Luhansk, and help them in their stated goal of taking over the rest of Donbas. If they are very emboldened, they might revive the scrapped project \"[Novorossiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novorossiya_\\(confederation\\))\" from 2014-2015 which means they will try to take over all of eastern Ukraine.

Because as far as I'm concerned these motherfuckers are a big element in the manufacturing and extending of divisions in the West, due to how successful they've been in influncing the far right with Brexit, Trump etc. They're masters in disinformation and manipulating the masses and they've been very successful in this. They even have the far right in the US apparently on their side now. \n\nI'm somewhat sympathetic to the argument about the national security implications of NATO infringing on Russian borders, and it does somewhat feel like in this particular case, promises from NATO have done far more to instill war than peace. But Ukraine, like any country, deserves autonomy, and deserves to not be bullied by their neighbours. \n\nThis is clearly an attempt by Putin to boil the frog, with an invasion that he can justify under the slimmest of pretences of liberating the 'freedom fighers' he funded and has been influecing. Nobody buys it who isn't fully gone of course, but hey, he's got his narrative. \n\nNaturally I'm a very anti-war and pro-peace person, but Russia is a dictatorship with a populace who has long suffered under Putin's rule: Russia's GDP per capita is patheitc, a poor country only somewhat propped up by an oil industry destroying the environment. The West's proclivity of 'bombing for freedom' has only ended badly, and there's no reason to believe this will be any different. But Russia has done great damage to the West, and has now begun occupying a foreign country, ensuring a lower quality of life for all of its victims. At a certain point there has to be a cost-benefit analysis of real firepower to stop this. I won't pretend to even begin to understand the geopolitics of the situation that would inform on where that threshold is, but I have to admit that even as a 'woke anti-war leftist' my main thoughts today are 'fuck Russia'.",

            "text": "It think it's important to recognize that shifts like this in respect for the international law surrounding use of force make the world a less safe and predictable place for everyone, not just the people in Eastern Europe. We have a defined mechanism for determining when violations of borders are warranted under UN Charter Article 51. This is no such circumstance, and the attempt to make it fit under Article 51 makes it more ripe for abuse in the future.\n\nRegardless of your opinion on the Donbas region, this is a net negative for the world.\n\nIn brief, international law is not spontaneously created to tell states what they can and cannot do. Rather it is a codification of state behaviour that allows states to understand how each other state in an otherwise anarchic state community behaves. This makes states more predictable, which, for the sake of international relations, is an extremely good if not necessary thing in the 21st century. \n\nThe law Russia violates by doing this is a use of force contrary to [UN Charter Article 2(4)](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-1). It is considered law *jus cogens*. In other words it is the cornerstone of the very system itself and is considered law above all law by the international community. There is no justification for using force except in accordance with [UN Charter article 51](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/chapter-7). At the moment, that test requires you show [imminence, necessity and proportionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_test) to protect the integrity of your own state, or another state has done so and has properly acted in self defence and have requested your assistance (i.e. collective self-defence).\n\nIt is this latter point where Russia has attempted to assert itself. Russia is attempting to claim collective self defence over two territories that are not themselves states. This places the world in a difficult place. If the world does not react at all, then customary interpretations of statehood may be altered in ways that allow for this behaviour in the future, thereby making the world less stable by allowing states a much broader excuse to intervene in each other's affairs (e.g. your province doesn't like your country and so I'm declaring a state in order invade it). Consequently, states are responding fiercely to this, but by doing so risk further violent provocation. It is a truly terrible circumstance and is more likely to happen again based on it occurring this time. An easy example of this was Russia using the exact same excuse in Crimea in 2014.\n\n**Edit**: Not sure if anyone cares to read but here's more https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/sy57po/putin_orders_in_russian_army_to_support/hxvx7kf?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n\n**Edit 2**: for people asking about why international law matters, how it is applied, and whether/why it appears to often be applied asymmetrically:   [PART I](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/h8jtst/us_navy_deploys_three_aircraft_carriers_to/fv3fqr9/)     [PART II](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/h8jtst/us_navy_deploys_three_aircraft_carriers_to/fv3hdfr/)",

What form of pressure gets this outcome? Putin is likely to take Dunbas and as a wedge against full sanctions threaten to take Kyiv using Soldiers stationed in Belarus. My guess, if Putin limits the invasion to Dunbas, the West Doesn't hit him with the full set of sanctions they've been screaming about for months, but the West may go above and beyond in terms of training and equipping Ukraine and maybe even sending in their own \"Peace Keepers\" to the remaining parts of the Ukraine.

It seems so far his goal is to create and hold this state of edge, news and tension. He's succeeding in that. But alone, overt invasion, giving the UN and international law, it just doesn't make sense. \n\nWhat is driving this? What is driving his actions? Russia is not some insane, unable to reason actor. Putin sees the world very differently, yes, but simply lining up troops and invading Ukraine doesn't add up. They've been at this for decades, and in the last decade, extremely effectively, if you look at the disruption in the US. What's the endgame in this? Not the US spin, or the EU spin, what's his thinking?\n\nDoes anyone have news or articles or theories that explains this better than current western journalism?",

You can also look to the underground resistances of multiple occupied countries during ww2 (France, Belgium, etc.) if you want examples of resistance movements in places with geography similar to Ukraine.\n\nI know it means little from a foreigner, but I wish Ukraine blessings and protection in this ongoing manufactured crisis; your country deserves better.",

This rhetoric constantly arises and even now in the cities of Donbass there are relevant posters with slogans like \"We won in 1945, we can win now.\". This is ridiculous.\n\nHis whole speech is like a reflection of internal problems: xenophobia/fascism, torture, problems with the courts, suppression of the opposition (at this point I choked on my tea), corruption, blah blah blah. This list is endless. It becomes especially sad for me personally when I remember Nemtsov. This man wasn’t saint, but he was fearless and was always close to the people. He understood where everything was going instantly. Boris said in plain text that Putin is a fucking crazy man, a prick (I don't even know how to translate the word, you guys don't have it in that sense) and with him the country will come to isolation and authoritarianism. And then they killed him.\nGuess who's the new Hitler here, Mr. Putin.\n\nIt is impossible to convey all thoughts and feelings, so my comment is a bit torn. And now it's night outside. In the end, I want to wish adequate Russians and Ukrainians peace, love and tranquility. Quit smoking, play sports and we will outlive this bastard together. Good luck to all of us!",

But the endless cycle that we've gotten into of escalate, escalate, escalate that began in the 90s has led to this point, and I fear this is a point of no return. The next thing that's going to happen is the US cuts the Nordstream pipeline and imposes sanctions, Putin probably reveals some ace up his sleeve that is the reason he's so confident in doing this, probably some economic deal with China to counter the US's economic warfare, the US trains extremist militia groups in Ukraine to kill Russian soldiers Afghanistan-style, and best-case scenario from there is that Ukraine essentially becomes Afghanistan 2 and the region is destabilized for decades. The worst-case scenario is that we enter into this never-ending cycle of escalation. Putin trains some militia soldiers in a NATO state to kill NATO troops, the US and NATO declare war on Russia, China declares war on the US and NATO, we're now in WW3, and there are plenty of nukes to go around.\n\nAll of it over abstract concepts regarding a nation that no longer exists and pieces of paper indicating which imperialist club the Ukrainian people have to suffer under, because make no mistake. The way this situation was going, they were going to end up an imperialist state either way. This has become such a terrible situation, and I don't know what the solution is, but I know one thing for damn sure. We should be doing everything we can right now to avoid WW3 at all costs, because that is the death of the human race. And we shouldn't be imposing any sanctions that hurt the Russian people either. Just the oligarchs and Putin. The Russian people have nothing to do with this. One can only hope that we can hurt the Russian oligarchs enough that they depose Putin. That seems like the only half-ass decent way out of this situation. They're probably going to replace Putin with someone just as bad for the Russian people, but one can only hope that next guy will not have imperialist ambitions. If that happens, the US needs to curb its imperialist ambitions as well, and Ukraine can't ever become a NATO state. These anti-Russian power grabs are exactly what got us to this point, and we now desperately need to de-escalate. Not to mention that imperialism is wrong, no matter which country is doing it.",

With the right wing racist and the cultish Christian groups were able to push the state and local governments of these two states into a potential armed and warlike separation from the United States that we know? And then Mexico announces they're going to move their soldiers into those States to occupy them and welcome them back into their country? This is literally the same thing.! The Ukraine is no longer part of Russia although it once was, now they are an independent nation thriving after they're separation from the Russians, they in a majority no longer want to be part of this Russian system and ideology, but a very narrow minority wants to rejoin Russia and are fighting to do so with the help of Russia handing them lots of weapons. Russia is creating terrorist by handing guns and explosive devices intended only to do war to people that supposedly miss being part of the Soviet Union. Just as the people of Texas Louisiana Oklahoma Miss being part of southern slave states. They don't want the United States government telling them that they can't be anti black anti-jew anti-non Christian and anti government. If you don't support these separatives in America then don't support these types of separatists and other nations that are part of the wall separating fascists and Russia from fascist in the United States. For all those that don't understand why we are a global community and why we are part of a global community this is it. If you don't want to end up in a country like Russia then learn why the people in Russia don't want to be part of a Nation like Russia. If you don't want to end up being told when where and how to do almost everything that you normally do then don't invite those ideals into your country or into any other country.

            "text": "\"You see,\" my colleague went on, \"one doesn’t see exactly where or how to move. Believe me, this is true. Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don’t want to act, or even talk, alone; you don’t want to ‘go out of your way to make trouble.’ Why not?—Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty.\n\n\"Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, ‘everyone’ is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, ‘It’s not so bad’ or ‘You’re seeing things’ or ‘You’re an alarmist.’\n\n\"And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can’t prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don’t know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have.\n\n\"But your friends are fewer now. Some have drifted off somewhere or submerged themselves in their work. You no longer see as many as you did at meetings or gatherings. Informal groups become smaller; attendance drops off in little organizations, and the organizations themselves wither. Now, in small gatherings of your oldest friends, you feel that you are talking to yourselves, that you are isolated from the reality of things. This weakens your confidence still further and serves as a further deterrent to—to what? It is clearer all the time that, if you are going to do anything, you must make an occasion to do it, and then you are obviously a troublemaker. So you wait, and you wait.\n\n\"But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That’s the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked—if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in ’43 had come immediately after the ‘German Firm’ stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in ’33. But of course this isn’t the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.\n\n\"And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying ‘Jewish swine,’ collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in—your nation, your people—is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\n\n\"You have gone almost all the way yourself. Life is a continuing process, a flow, not a succession of acts and events at all. It has flowed to a new level, carrying you with it, without any effort on your part. On this new level you live, you have been living more comfortably every day, with new morals, new principles. You have accepted things you would not have accepted five years ago, a year ago, things that your father, even in Germany, could not have imagined.\n\n\"Suddenly it all comes down, all at once. You see what you are, what you have done, or, more accurately, what you haven’t done (for that was all that was required of most of us: that we do nothing). You remember those early meetings of your department in the university when, if one had stood, others would have stood, perhaps, but no one stood. A small matter, a matter of hiring this man or that, and you hired this one rather than that. You remember everything now, and your heart breaks. Too late. You are compromised beyond repair.\n\nMilton Mayer, “They Thought They Were Free: Germany 1933-45”",

We didn't work on solution while there were still options and now we will let Putin had his way and do \"sanctions\" to keep some dignity while we will make sure those sanctions don't hurt us - making them just a pose.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe I'm completely wrong. After all I build my conclusions completely on what I learned from media and that is not something to be trusted in general. People from Ukraine could most certainly disagree with me and I'm happy if you do and correct my ignorance.\n\nWhat is happening is terrible but could it end in any other way? I'm in no way in agreement with what Russia is doing. I don't like Mr. Putin. But really, I think this is West fault as much as Russian's and Ukraine's.\n\nPutin is just playing the game because he knows no one will stop him. West has been toothless against Russia and China for years. Western powers end with scolding anyone who does not play to our rulebook (aka international laws) but don't go any further to protect their own stability.\n\nIt always comes down to two problems - choosing lesser evil and money. Except we delay choosing lesser evil to the point when even the lesser evil is totally unacceptable and then we are all surprised how events have evolved.\n\nMy opinion is that in 2014 western should step in into conflict in Ukraine and start dialog about peaceful separation. This should include properly conducted referendum to figure out if people there really want separation or if it is just few empowered psychopaths shouting loudest. Maybe majority of people really wanted separation, maybe not. Any referendum conducted without international supervision does not say anything and at the same time making any steps without understanding what people really want is pointless.\n\nBut that didn't happen. Why? Because everyone is looking after their goals first and countries like Spain are never going to help any separation because that would endanger their own integrity. After all Spain still didn't recognize Kosovo which declared its independence 13 years ago. Instead western started preaching united Ukraine when country was at civil war and there was no way it could end well. So instead of choosing lesser evil and helping with peaceful separation, we let it go, waited and hoped for a miracle.\n\nAnd Putin took initiative and delivered miracle of his making playing to his goals instead. And here we are. We are again choosing between two evils. Let Putin have his cake and eat it or go to military conflict with Russia. Unsurprisingly, second is not an option. There is no appetite among voters of majority of NATO countries for a war. Especially when no one is directly endangering NATO. So separation will happen at dictate of Putin.\n\nWest will just play they standard cards which failed every single time before. We will do sanctions. But we will do sanctions only to the level of international law - because we are good guys after all but what is more important - we will look after our money so we will do sanctions which will not hurt us too much. Meaning, we will do sanctions Putin and his pals will only laugh to while planning next \"attack\". What is even worse, most sanctions will hit common Russians and not those in lead positions and empower Putin in his propaganda even more.\n\nNothing will change. West is dependent on resources from Russia and countries like UK are willing to ignore anything - being it atrocities, violation of human rights or invading another country when it comes to foreign money coming to the country. Moreover, no one wants WW3 ... except we are already in war of ideologies and we are loosing.\n\nWe don't want war, we want to protect our way of living and only goal we have is our economic growth. That just does not align with our ambition of playing world police force and dictating everyone how to behave. Historically, all \"advanced\" cultures were destroyed by others who didn't want to play to their rules.\n\nI'm sorry if I offended anyone with my view on the current mess.",

If you find these harsh words to hear when I speak to you, then look at yourselves in the mirror and wonder what you could do instead of murdering people, and threatening people, and manipulate people into doing what you think is what is needed to be done, yet it does not need to be done by you or anyone on this planet.

Your hearts will never ever grow spiritually if you keep thinking with your mind as you see evidence of what has happened to Atlantis and the decline of the continent and the people. Their hearts grew cold and withered away and their mind was the reason for that darkness and depression. This will not be another era of that happening and I am saying this to you all on the planet. Stand up and say what is in your healed hearts, not in your hearts that have not healed yet.
