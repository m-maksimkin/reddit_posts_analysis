Two days ago, I read that within Russia, US intelligence reports were being dismissed by the public as part of an American misinformation campaign. But now that it's playing out *exactly as the US said it would,* it seriously undermines Putin's frequent talking point that the US is lying.\n\nI don't say any of this to chest-thump for the US, but to show how badly I think Putin has miscalculated. The approach the US took these past several weeks in publicly and frequently airing accurate intelligence has put Putin in a tough spot. There's no getting around the fact that he's been lying this whole time (to the world and to his own people), and that the US was telling the truth.\n\nThere's a universe where Putin could have NOT invaded Ukraine and actually made Biden look like an alarmist fool.

            "text": "\nMy take on NATO‚Äôs strategy here. Putin‚Äôs expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin‚Äôs logical madness. \n\nNATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin‚Äôs obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. \n\nWhen toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. \n\nThe issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin‚Äôs ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe‚Äôs economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO‚Äôs hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. \n\nAs Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to ‚Äúcontested‚Äù regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. \n\nWith Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin‚Äôs circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. \n\nThe west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn‚Äôt know, and isn‚Äôt deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.\n\ndit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are.

The approach the US took these past several weeks in publicly and frequently airing accurate intelligence has put Putin in a tough spot. There's no getting around the fact that he's been lying this whole time (to the world and to his own people), and that the US was telling the truth. \n\nThere's a universe where Putin could have NOT invaded Ukraine and actually made Biden look like an alarmist fool. But he didn't do that, and now he's the one who is coming across as irrational. No idea if this will lead to Putin's overthrow (wishful thinking) but hopefully it dulls his sheen within Russia and helps more Russians understand that he's not trustworthy.",

If you dig deeper or look into the story more, the article says that the signatories are municipal officials. The headline makes it sound like Putin is facing some kind of mass resistance from his generals and advisers, which is not supported by the text at all. Digging around [other sources](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/24/no-choice-but-to-invade-ukraine-kremlin) again seems to suggest that the highest ranking signatories seem to be municipal deputies. According to [this site](https://www.ponarseurasia.org/independent-municipal-deputies-the-new-face-of-russian-politics/) it's a pretty low rank with very little power, and my other research has confirmed this. City council members are not senior officials. \n\nDon't get me wrong, it's great to see municipal officials in major Russian cities challenging this war of imperialism and I hope the resistance continues to grow. The real story itself *is* pretty big news. But don't let disreputable papers like the Daily Mail mislead you with tricky, attention grabbing headlines. Casual headline-skimmers might see this and assume the situation is sure to be resolved soon, a dangerous assumption when pressure on Russia is critical.",

We have reception points ready at the border where you can find shelter, food, medical and legal aid.\n\nPolish government launched a dedicated site to help you: ua.gov.pl\n\nPlease share this information if you know anyone seeking help right now.\n\nEDIT: YOU DON'T NEED VISA TO PASS THROUGH POLISH BORDER. ALL YOU NEED IS PASSPORT. VISAS ARE SUSPENDED! YOU DON'T NEED THEM FOR TIME BEING!!!!!!\n\nEDIT2: as a proof that you no longer need visa:\n\n‚Ä¢\t‚Å†in Ukrainian https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua ‚Ä¢\t‚Å†in English https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en\n\nMINE EDIT: heres part of what is in the link. Advise you to read the full page tho:\n\nIf you entered Poland¬†based on:\n\nvisa-free travel regime ‚Äì your legal stay is 90 days;\n\nnational visa or a Schengen visa ‚Äì your stay is legal in accordance with the period of validity of the visa and the residency period indicated therein; After the expiry of the residence on the basis of the national visa, you can continue your stay without leaving under visa-free movement up to 90 days with a biometric passport;\n\nlong-term visa or a residence permit issued by another Schengen state - your legal stay is going to last up to 90 days;\n\nconsent of the commander in Chief of the Polish Border Guard ‚Äì your legal stay lasts 15 days.\n\nIf you wish to extend your legal stay, you can file an application for granting temporary residence permit, or in the case of meeting the criteria on granting permanent residence permit. These applications shall be submitted in the Voivodeship Office having jurisdiction over the place of residence.\n\nRegardless of the above, you will be permitted to legally stay in the territory of the Republic of Poland on the basis of special provisions regarding the COVID-19 epidemic.\n\nFollow this website ‚Äì we are going to update it and provide the key information.\n\nIf you need additional information, please call the following infoline: +48¬†47 721 75 75¬†\n\nTl;dr: polish borders are open. You can get there without visas just passport is enough. Without visa you can only stay 90 days though.\n\nEdit: just now in polish news it was said that the wait time to cross polish border in the city \"Medyka\" is 8 hours. I can only assume that its similiar everywhere else.\n\nTranslation by u/megaderek2011\n\n–®–∞–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ñ —É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Ü—ñ!\n\n–£ —Å–æ—Ü–º–µ—Ä–µ–∂–∞—Ö —è —á—É–≤, —â–æ –ø–æ—à–∏—Ä—é—é—Ç—å—Å—è —Ñ–µ–π–∫–æ–≤—ñ –Ω–æ–≤–∏–Ω–∏ (—Å–∫–æ—Ä—ñ—à–µ –∑–∞ –≤—Å–µ, –ø—ñ–¥—Ç—Ä–∏–º—É–≤–∞–Ω—ñ –†–æ—Å—ñ—î—é —Ç—Ä–æ–ª—ñ), —â–æ –ø–æ–ª—å—Å—å–∫–∏–π –∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω –∑–∞–∫—Ä–∏—Ç–∏–π.\n\n–¶–µ –±—Ä–µ—Ö–Ω—è.\n\n–Ø–∫—â–æ –≤–∏ —à—É–∫–∞—î—Ç–µ –ø—Ä–∏—Ç—É–ª–∫—É ‚Äì –π–¥—ñ—Ç—å –¥–æ –ø–æ–ª—å—Å—å–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω—É.  –ú–∏ –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤—ñ –¥–æ –≤–∞—à–æ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—ó–∑–¥—É.  –ù–∞ –∫–æ—Ä–¥–æ–Ω—ñ –≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤—ñ –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–∏–π–æ–º—É, –¥–µ –≤–∏ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –∑–Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏ –ø—Ä–∏—Ç—É–ª–æ–∫, —ó–∂—É, –º–µ–¥–∏—á–Ω—É —Ç–∞ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–æ–≤—É –¥–æ–ø–æ–º–æ–≥—É.\n\n–ü–æ–ª—å—Å—å–∫–∏–π —É—Ä—è–¥ –∑–∞–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏–≤ —Å–ø–µ—Ü—ñ–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–π —Å–∞–π—Ç, —â–æ–± –¥–æ–ø–æ–º–æ–≥—Ç–∏ –≤–∞–º: ua.gov.pl\n\n–ë—É–¥—å –ª–∞—Å–∫–∞, –ø–æ–¥—ñ–ª—ñ—Ç—å—Å—è —Ü—ñ—î—é —ñ–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü—ñ—î—é, —è–∫—â–æ –≤–∏ –∑–Ω–∞—î—Ç–µ –∫–æ–≥–æ—Å—å, —Ö—Ç–æ –∑–∞—Ä–∞–∑ —à—É–∫–∞—î –¥–æ–ø–æ–º–æ–≥–∏.\n\n–†–ï–î–ê–ö–¢–ò–†–û–í–ê–¢–ò: –í–ê–ú –ù–ï –ü–û–¢–†–Ü–ë–ù–ê –í–Ü–ó–ê –î–õ–Ø –ü–†–û–ô–î–ñ–ï–ù–ù–Ø –ü–û–õ–¨–°–¨–ö–ò–ú –ö–û–†–î–û–ù–û–ú.  –í–°–ï, —â–æ –í–ê–ú –ü–û–¢–†–Ü–ë–ù–û, - —Ü–µ –ü–ê–°–ü–û–†–¢.  –í–Ü–ó–ò –ü–†–ò–°–ü–ò–ù–ï–ù–û!  –í–û–ù–ò –í–ê–ú –ù–ï –ü–û–¢–†–Ü–ë–ù–ò –ù–ê –ß–ê–°!!!!!!\n\nEDIT2: —è–∫ –¥–æ–∫–∞–∑ —Ç–æ–≥–æ, —â–æ –≤–∞–º –±—ñ–ª—å—à–µ –Ω–µ –ø–æ—Ç—Ä—ñ–±–Ω–∞ –≤—ñ–∑–∞:\n\n‚Ä¢ ‚Å†—É–∫—Ä–∞—ó–Ω—Å—å–∫–æ—é https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina---ua ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†–∞–Ω–≥–ª—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ—é https://www.gov.pl/web/udsc/ukraina-en\n\n–í–∏–±–∞—á—Ç–µ, —è–∫—â–æ —Ü–µ –¥—É—Ä–Ω–∏—Ü—è, —è –≤–∏–∫–æ—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ–≤—É–≤–∞–≤ Google Translate",

The battle  plan seems to have been drawn up by a 4 year old with none of the forces knowing what they should be doing or where they should be going. It reminds me of when corporal Hitler  suddenly  decided he was a military genius in ww2 when he took overall control of the forces in Russia ignoring more qualified professional soldiers that knew what they were talking about and how to do things.  Putin will soon be looking for an exit strategy, but I can't  see it ending well for him or Russia.",

Two days ago, I read that within Russia, US intelligence reports were being dismissed by the public as part of an American misinformation campaign. But now that it's playing out *exactly as the US said it would,* it seriously undermines Putin's frequent talking point that the US is lying.\n\nI don't say any of this to chest-thump for the US, but to show how badly I think Putin has miscalculated. The approach the US took these past several weeks in publicly and frequently airing accurate intelligence has put Putin in a tough spot. There's no getting around the fact that he's been lying this whole time (to the world and to his own people), and that the US was telling the truth.\n\nThere's a universe where Putin could have NOT invaded Ukraine and actually made Biden look like an alarmist fool. But he didn't do that, and now he's the one who is coming across as irrational. No idea if this will lead to Putin's overthrow (wishful thinking) but hopefully it dulls his sheen within Russia and helps more Russians understand that he's not trustworthy.",
