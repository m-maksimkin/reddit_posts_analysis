We in the US and other parts of the world know there needs to be transparent and foolproof elections, it‚Äôs far too easy for these parasitic globalists to control election outcomes. \n The truth seems to be that both leaders have some serious ‚Äú baggage‚Äù when it comes to their political history and moral integrity, Putin being so self absorbed and power hungry, unable to show restraint and diplomacy, his only saving grace is  that he won‚Äôt likely acquiesce to the Global Elite Establishment ( Thunk DAVOS, Klaus Schwab -Dr. Evil himself!)  but it‚Äôs essentially choosing one thug over another, a vote for the least evil villain - instead of for the Most Compassionate, the Most Brilliant, best hero! So it is in nearly all political arenas.  Neither man keeps the best interests of their fellow human, close to their hearts. It is ALL about POWER & GREED and AUTHORITARIAN LEADERSHIP! .Attempting to bring forth a free and open society is NOT on the DAVOS game plan! Sovereignty for the people is the LAST THING THEY WANT! It just isn‚Äôt on either man‚Äôs radar, tbh. For if it were, they would both want to eradicate unlawful, parasitic, greed possessed  factions from Ukraine (and Russia)! But that just isn‚Äôt happening. And as always with Globalist war games, we can be 100% certain they fund both sides, because historically, to these conscienceless narcissists, war is always a game- they couldn‚Äôt care less who suffers or perishes in the crosshairs! \n\nI do not for one second believe that a Nuclear War is afoot. But I do believe the real instigators of all of this - the Globalists, are spinning it that way to instill more fear and steal more freedoms! They are sociopaths, the most spiritually corrupt, possessed asshats to rise to power! They that have no problem exterminating human life. These are Service to Self, Luciferians raising up their kids as luciferians, without morals or conscience!  They are taught from the get-go to lie, cheat, gaslight, be unaccountable and immoral, to stamp out compassion and empathy, to abuse others, members of their own families even, etc., and Having proved this historically throughout every major tragedy, they‚Äôve got blood on their hands! They don‚Äôt care! This pandemic, 9/11, the Kennedy Assassinations, and the assassination of MLK, of anyone who objects, protests too much or gets in their way!!! \n\nWe should be on to them (and their techno prot√©g√©s) by now.

            "text": "Here‚Äôs my theory: Nobody other than Putin wanted this war. But for the U.S. and Europe it is also an opportunity - to take Putin and his government down, economically, through sanctions. \n\nU.S. intelligence saw this war coming a mile away, as did some other observers. Russia has been preparing for it for at least a year (if not, by other accounting, the past 8 years). And the American government has spent that time crafting a deadly set of sanctions and getting Europe to go along with them. That‚Äôs why they were able to bring the hammer down so hard and so fast. Creating effective sanctions, and getting all the necessary players on board, is a hard thing to do. But they‚Äôve done it. There‚Äôs a clip I just saw of the French finance minister saying on TV (paraphrasing here) that they intend to cause the utter destruction of the Russian economy. Wow.\n\nIs this all just to support Ukraine? Partly, no doubt. But Putin has been a thorn in the side of western governments for years, and this is the golden opportunity to finally end him. For those (like, say, Germany) who might have been recalcitrant, the moral plight of Ukrainians is just the thing to ensure cooperation. Even if Putin isn‚Äôt assassinated or forced from power, and the government doesn‚Äôt fall, Russia will be too broken after this to cause much trouble for anybody.\n\nThis all would have happened no matter how the war had gone. If Russia had taken Kyiv on day 2 the sanctions would have been imposed as punishment. Since they haven‚Äôt been that successful, there may be hope that the sanctions can actually slow their war effort. The only problem now is that Putin‚Äôs situation is more and more desperate, as this article illustrates. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worthwhile taking about nukes - if he goes there he‚Äôs well and truly ‚Äòround the bend and rational considerations are more or less meaningless. But his desperate need for military victory, coupled with an increasing sense of having nothing to lose, means that he‚Äôs going to unleash hell on Ukrainian cities, the way Russia did in Grozny or Aleppo. We‚Äôre already seeing some of that in Kharkiv and Chernihiv and maybe already the outskirts of Kyiv. \n\nWhich is why the US and EU countries have done an about-face and are rushing piles of heavy weapons to Ukraine at top speed. If Russia had won in 3 days, as many seem to have expected, it would have been moot. But now that they haven‚Äôt, Ukraine is going to feel the brunt of Putin‚Äôs wrath, and the sanctions are probably only going to make that worse, at least in the short term. So the least everyone else can do is give them weapons. Let‚Äôs hope they make a difference.\n\n–°–ª–∞–≤–∞ —É–∫—Ä–∞i–Ωi.",

I wanted to leave for some small country that does not puff up to be great, I chose between my beloved Spain and Portugal, which, by the will of history, were deprived of their former greatness and power, and became simply human countries, beautifully resigned to the loss of the status of former mistresses.  I kept postponing and postponing the evacuation, it was not clear what I was hoping for.\n      And today I was even deprived of this right, the right to leave.  No, there is a visa and there are some reasons to be accepted, but there is also an understanding that I cannot live in shame without raising my eyes, I cannot live with an eternally apologetic face and an internal monologue: sorry, kind people, this is not me, I  was against it and all that...\n      Today, I am glad for the beginning of the fucking retribution, in a strange way I am glad for the collapse that befell our country, deservedly, because we were slaves and a herd, more or less well-fed, just a cowardly and non-thinking passive herd, today I have to stay to do something here, since all the smart and practical have already left.  But the only country I'm drawn to now is Ukraine.  I personally want to do my best to repent of the irreparable damage done to this land and people on my behalf.  I‚Äôm a good designer, but I‚Äôm ready to go to clear rubble with my own hands, take care of the wounded, teach children, cook food, sweep the streets, write texts, whatever, I can do all this very well, just so as not to be so painfully ashamed.

Right now, those people are in a larger peril in Russia than they would be in Ukraine.\n\nA lot of Russians that oppose crazy politics, for one reason or another, are spread all across the world ‚Äì they're being humiliated and attacked by people that don't understand that they are friends, absolutely noble and sane people ‚Äì and they are, too, victims of a bunch of deranged people and deceived slaves. It's important: today it was not the ethical but the technological part of the problem that went on a new, never seen before level ‚Äì that's why all of us should be united in our goal of stopping the fall of the world we knew, saving the lives of billions of people. You have to understand that today the world isn't divided only into nations but also into mind and anti-mind, decency and rottenness, which do not have nations. From all the points of the Earth, we should stop the ongoing insanity.\n\nI ask all of you to share this message, I ask all mass media to publish it so that the quantity grows into quality: it should be heard by the puppeteer and by other puppeteers. It doesn't matter if you like me or not ‚Äì right now it's irrelevant: if we don't stop the catastrophe, then everyone will perish, just look at your families, look at your houses ‚Äì there will be nothing left!! There is a solution, but in a few hours it will be gone! What I can do right now ‚Äì soon, it is something nobody will be able to do. We must stop the war, stop the hatred, stop the puppeteer and the puppeteers. Let ministers try to get through to him, let the cleaners in generals' houses cling onto them with a scream ‚Äì take this message to the superior so that he takes it to the owner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¬ª\n\nOriginal:\n\n–ï–≤–≥–µ–Ω–∏–π –ü–æ–Ω–∞—Å–µ–Ω–∫–æ–≤:\n\n¬´–Ø, –≥—Ä–∞–∂–¥–∞–Ω–∏–Ω –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏, —Ö–æ—á—É –æ–±—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –∫ —É–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—Ü–∞–º, –∂–µ—Ä—Ç–≤–∞–º —á—É–¥–æ–≤–∏—â–Ω–æ–π –∞–≥—Ä–µ—Å—Å–∏–∏: –∑–Ω–∞–π—Ç–µ, —á—Ç–æ –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –∂–∏–≤—É—Ç –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –º—Ä–∞–∫–æ–±–µ—Å—ã, –∂–µ–ª–∞—é—â–∏–µ —É–Ω–∏—á—Ç–æ–∂–∞—Ç—å –≤—Å–µ –∂–∏–≤–æ–µ, –Ω–æ –∏ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–æ–π–Ω—ã–µ, —Å–º–µ–ª—ã–µ –ª—é–¥–∏, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –ø–æ–¥ —É–≥—Ä–æ–∑–æ–π —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–∏ —Å–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–ª—è—é—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞—Ç–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ. –°–µ–π—á–∞—Å —Ç–∞–∫–∏–º –ª—é–¥—è–º –≤ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ - –æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–µ–µ, —á–µ–º –≤ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ.\n\n–¢–∞–∫–∂–µ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏–µ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ, —Å–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Ç–∏–≤–ª—è—é—â–∏–µ—Å—è –±–µ–∑—É–º–Ω–æ–π –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–µ, –ø–æ —Ç–µ–º –∏–ª–∏ –∏–Ω—ã–º –ø—Ä–∏—á–∏–Ω–∞–º —Ä–∞–∑–±—Ä–æ—Å–∞–Ω—ã –ø–æ –º–∏—Ä—É - –∏ —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å –∏—Ö —É–Ω–∏–∂–∞—é—Ç –∏ –∞—Ç–∞–∫—É—é—Ç –æ–∫—Ä—É–∂–∞—é—â–∏–µ, –Ω–µ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—è, —á—Ç–æ –æ–Ω–∏ –¥—Ä—É–∑—å—è, –∞–±—Å–æ–ª—é—Ç–Ω–æ –±–ª–∞–≥–æ—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ –∏ –≤–º–µ–Ω—è–µ–º—ã–µ –ª—é–¥–∏ - –∏ –æ–Ω–∏ —Ç–æ–∂–µ –∂–µ—Ä—Ç–≤—ã –º–∞—Ä–∞–∑–º–∞ –∫—É—á–∫–∏ –º—Ä–∞–∫–æ–±–µ—Å–æ–≤ –∏ –æ–±–º–∞–Ω—É—Ç—ã—Ö –∏–º–∏ —Ä–∞–±–æ–≤. –í–∞–∂–Ω–æ: —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –Ω–µ –Ω—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è, –∞ —Ç–µ—Ö–Ω–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–∞ –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º—ã –≤—ã—à–ª–∞ –Ω–∞ –Ω–æ–≤—ã–π, –Ω–µ–≤–∏–¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –ø—Ä–µ–∂–¥–µ —É—Ä–æ–≤–µ–Ω—å - –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É –º—ã –≤—Å–µ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –±—ã—Ç—å –µ–¥–∏–Ω—ã –≤ —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–º–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å –∫—Ä–∞—Ö —Ç–æ–≥–æ –º–∏—Ä–∞, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –º—ã –≤—Å–µ –∑–Ω–∞–ª–∏, —Å–ø–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏ –º–∏–ª–ª–∏–∞—Ä–¥–æ–≤ –ª—é–¥–µ–π. –í—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è –º–∏—Ä –¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç—Å—è –Ω–µ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –Ω–∞ –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –Ω–æ –∏ –Ω–∞ —Ä–∞–∑—É–º –∏ –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—Ä–∞–∑—É–º, –ø–æ—Ä—è–¥–æ—á–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å - –∏ –ø–æ–¥–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ, —É –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–≥–æ –Ω–µ—Ç –Ω–∞—Ü–∏–∏. –ú—ã —Å –≤–∞–º–∏ - –≤–æ –≤—Å–µ—Ö –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–∞—Ö –º–∏—Ä–∞ –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å –ø—Ä–æ–∏—Å—Ö–æ–¥—è—â–µ–µ –±–µ–∑—É–º–∏–µ.\n\n–Ø –ø—Ä–æ—à—É –≤–∞—Å –≤—Å–µ—Ö –ø–æ–¥–µ–ª–∏—Ç—å—Å—è —ç—Ç–∏–º —Å–æ–æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º, –ø—Ä–æ—à—É –≤—Å–µ –°–ú–ò –µ–≥–æ –æ–ø—É–±–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ä–æ—Å–ª–æ –≤ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Å–æ–±—ã—Ç–∏—è: –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã —É—Å–ª—ã—à–∞—Ç—å –∫—É–∫–ª–æ–≤–æ–¥ –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–µ –∫—É–∫–ª–æ–≤–æ–¥—ã. –ù—Ä–∞–≤–ª—é—Å—å —è –≤–∞–º –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–µ—Ç - —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å —É–∂–µ –Ω–µ –¥–æ —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ: –µ—Å–ª–∏ –º—ã –Ω–µ –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏–º –∫–∞—Ç–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ—É, —Ç–æ —Å–¥–æ—Ö–Ω—É—Ç –≤—Å–µ, –ø—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–æ –ø–æ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–æ–∏ —Å–µ–º—å–∏, –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–æ–∏ –¥–æ–º–∞ - —ç—Ç–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ –Ω–µ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç!! –í—ã—Ö–æ–¥ –µ—Å—Ç—å, –Ω–æ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —á–∞—Å–æ–≤ - –µ–≥–æ –Ω–µ—Ç! –¢–û, —á—Ç–æ —è –º–æ–≥—É —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å —Å–µ–π—á–∞—Å - –Ω–∏–∫—Ç–æ –Ω–µ —Å–º–æ–∂–µ—Ç —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –≤—Å–∫–æ—Ä–µ. –ú—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å –≤–æ–π–Ω—É, –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å –Ω–µ–Ω–∞–≤–∏—Å—Ç—å, –æ—Å—Ç–∞–Ω–æ–≤–∏—Ç—å –∫—É–∫–ª–æ–≤–æ–¥–æ–≤ –∏ –∫—É–∫–ª–æ–≤–æ–¥–∞. –ü—É—Å—Ç—å –ø—ã—Ç–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –ø—Ä–æ–±–∏—Ç—å—Å—è –∫ –Ω–µ–º—É –º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä—ã, –ø—É—Å—Ç—å —É–±–æ—Ä—â–∏—Ü—ã –≤ –¥–æ–º–∞—Ö –≥–µ–Ω–µ—Ä–∞–ª–æ–≤ –≤—Ü–µ–ø—è—Ç—Å—è –≤ –Ω–∏—Ö —Å –∫—Ä–∏–∫–æ–º - –¥–æ–Ω–µ—Å–∏ —ç—Ç–æ—Ç —Ç–µ–∫—Å—Ç –¥–æ –Ω–∞—á–∞–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫–∞, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Ç–æ—Ç –¥–æ–Ω–µ—Å –¥–æ —Ö–æ–∑—è–∏–Ω–∞!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!¬ª",
