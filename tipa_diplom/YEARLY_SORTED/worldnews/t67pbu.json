Exact details of this operation were never released by the Russian government. Russian reconnaissance planes in the area had been monitoring satellite communications for quite some time trying to match Dudayev's voice signature to the existing samples of his speech. Dudayev's phone signature and coordinates were also reportedly passed to the Russians by the NSA after U.S. President Bill Clinton's meeting with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.\\[15\\] It was claimed Dudayev was killed by a combination of an airstrike and a booby trap. He was 52 years old.\\[16\\]",

As someone from the US, I can easily agree that we deserve a lot of the criticism we get; however, no nation has ever before unilaterally attempted under threat of nuclear annihilation (and with essentially no support from any other national government outside puppet regimes) to annex a sovereign territory and essentially just said \"Do something about it - we'll kill  everyone\"  \n\n\nThe bombings in Serbia were terrible, but they did have a cause. Whether this was the right intervention or not, I cannot say, but it is not the same as what is happening in Ukraine.  \n\n\nThe conflict is Gaza is awful. Religious and racial hatred coupled with the aggressive appropriation of land have lead to an awful situation in the region. Its terrible, but it is not the same as what is happening in Ukraine.  \n\n\nIt is a shame that any human should die this way in modern time because we should be able to rationally solve our problems without killing each other.  \n\n\nVolodymyr Zelensky is an absolute testament to leadership. I wish all our politicians could function this way. The fact that he has the iron will to stand up to the Russian war machine is beyond commendable. The treat of nuclear force against civilians and nonaggressive defenders is the single most evil thing I can imagine.
