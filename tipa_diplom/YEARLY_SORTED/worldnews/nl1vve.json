Under Israeli law, it's much, much harder to withdraw from formally annexed territories, as opposed to merely occupied ones. It requires both a referendum and a full quorum in the Knesset.

Their holiest site which was destroyed (the western wall still stands) is where the dome of the rock now sits. Imagine that? The Jews‚Äô holiest site gets destroyed, the Muslims come in and decide it‚Äôs now of their holy sites, and builds a mosque right on top of the destroyed temple. That sounds like a big ‚Äúfuck you, it‚Äôs ours now‚Äù situation. Hundreds of years with various rulers over the land and Jews had been persecuted and exiled over and over again. But Jews always remained and always returned to the land. The Jews have faced ethnic cleansing from all the surrounding countries, actual genocide during the Holocaust, slavery in Egypt, consistent exile and persecution, and finally in 1948 they‚Äôre offered their original homeland BACK. Then the surrounding Arab countries declare war and reject the creation of the state of Israel and by a miracle - Israel won. Wars have always led to an outcome that some don‚Äôt like but war is war, is it not? Hamas calls for not only the destruction of Israel but death to the Jews. You can‚Äôt honestly say that all they want is peace. Jews make up less than .02% of the population and all they want is to live in peace in a tiny piece of land smaller than New Jersey. The amount of land by comparison belonging to Arab and Muslim nations is astounding. This is not an issue of anything other than anti-semitism and it always has been and always will be. People hate Jews and will use any excuse to justify it. Israel is not a racist apartheid country who commits genocide. These are highly hyperbolic words that are so damaging to a people who have actual been ethnically cleansed out of societies for centuries and also have been massively slaughtered for all of time. There is a peaceful solution but the truth is that the Palestinians (or at least the leaders) do not want peace. As they say, they want the destruction of Israel and death to Jews.",

That's plenty of time for whole generations to live and die on American soil while being British subjects. Nearly the entirety of the Founding Fathers were born on American soil, and the intellectual ideas of the Enlightenment were the inspiration behind many of the early writings during the revolutionary period, such as the Federalist Papers. Are those Carribean ideals because Alexander Hamilton was born there rather than America? English thinkers influenced the Constitution just as much as French, German, and Dutch philosophers. \n\nYou've got quite a complicated definition of oppression and how to assign responsibility, but it's certainly not helpful to introduce arbitrary caveats. Everyone, everywhere, without exemption, are responsible for the deeds they have done, full stop. There is no time period when murder has been socially acceptable.

Archeological evidence and scriptures essentially prove this. Dwell on that fact for a moment. It became \"Arab\" land after they stole it, years following the Roman exodus of the Jews. Palestinians settled on stolen land. Fine, that's how conquests work, right?\n\nIt would have remained \"Arab\" land but with a small section cut out for the Jews to live alongside them peacefully. In other words nobody would have been \"expelled\" from their home so to speak. This was the original plan set forth by the Balfour Declaration and with boundaries specified by the UN. The surrounding Arabs were unhappy about living alongside their Jewish neighbors and, in 1947, chose to instigate attacks which kicked off the 1948 war. Because a war was in effect, many Palestinians wilfully evacuated and this was largely due to insistence from the Arab military commanders. Well the Arabs lost the war that they started, failed to ever concede in that loss, and have pursued the aggressive route ever since. Just to name a few examples: declining multiple offers for a two-state solution, executing various unrelated terrorist attacks, launching rockets indiscriminately toward Israeli civilians, co-conspiring to eradicate Israel in 1967 (leading to a six-day war), and most recently fanning the flames via media and press so as to amplify the Anti-Israel bias.\n\nYou expect Israel to give land back after all that? Good luck. Best we can hope for at this point is a two-state solution for which both sides can agree on the boundaries. But as Hamas continues to perpetuate its *double* war crimes of attacking Israeli civilians from areas flooded with Palestinian civilians, don't expect Israel to loosen the noose.",
