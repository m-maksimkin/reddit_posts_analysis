In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the to United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate\n‚ñ∫ In 1984, David Bogatin ‚Äî a convicted Russian mobster and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss ‚Äî met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, Apr 30, 1992)\nhttps://www.mhpbooks.com/books/the-making-of-donald-trump/\n‚ñ∫ Felix Sater He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former \"fixer\" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html\n‚ñ∫ Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.\n‚ñ∫ The Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. That is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.\n‚ñ∫ Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive. Now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties to the Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.\n‚ñ∫ A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnell got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Craig Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money.\n‚ñ∫ At the Cityscape USA‚Äôs Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Donald Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying \"...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\"\n‚ñ∫ Eric Trump told golf reporter James Dodson in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt rely on American banks.

I can‚Äôt even believe I am making a post like this and it will probably get buried, but if someone has the ability to translate it to Ukrainian please do. I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.  \nFor the defenders of Kiev, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :  \n1.) Stay out of the steet.  \n2.) Stay out of street.  \n3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.  \n4.) Doors are called ‚Äúthe fatal funnel.‚Äù It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.  \n5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn‚Äôt blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible.  \n6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders.  \n7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You‚Äôll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.  \n8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don‚Äôt look above or below until last.  \n9.) Don‚Äôt sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.  \n10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it‚Äôs much more handy than a rifle.  \n11.) Never fire from the same window twice.  \n12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don‚Äôt expose it.  \n13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.  \n14.) If you wound an enemy, don‚Äôt kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That‚Äôs four less rifles firing at you.  \n15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him. 16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.  \n17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.  \n18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don‚Äôt have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area. 19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.  \n20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It‚Äôs very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.  \n21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.  \n22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.  \nI don‚Äôt know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.  \nGlory to Ukraine.  \nEdit: A few extras.  \n23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.  \n24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.  \n25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force. 26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.  \n27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.  \n28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.  \n29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia. 30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long",

It‚Äôs his insane quest to reunite the USSR and regain control over the NATO blocking buffer states of Georgia and Ukraine, not the will of the people and most likely not the will of most of the other oligarchs over there.\n\nWe need to topple Putin and end his regime.

The enemy will surely be punished for killing Ukrainian children. Ukraine will not forgive them for this,\" Shmyhal said.  \nThe prime minister said Russia was deliberately attacking civilian infrastructure because it is \"failing\" in its offensive.  \n\"The Russian government doesn't understand they are not fighting only with the government. In fact, they are fighting against the entire Ukrainian people,\" he said.  \nRussia said its forces are only targeting military installations and are not striking residential areas.   \nAfter a Saturday government meeting, Shmyhal announced Ukraine is temporarily closing its borders with Belarus and Russia except for Ukrainian citizens abroad, whom he urged to join the fight.  \n\"Please do come back and do prove you are on the side of the light. And I'm addressing all civilized countries: On whose side are you on?\" Shmyhal asked. \"Are you on the side of the killers of children, or are you on the side of the great European people who are defending their country and they're defending their freedom from the aggression?\"\"",

Oligarchs convened there so no one would flee. Putin is furious, he thought that the whole war would be easy and everything would be done in 1-4 days.\n\nRussians didn‚Äôt have a tactical plan. The war costs about $20 bln/day. There are rockets for 3-4 days at most, they use them sparingly. They lack weapons, the Tula and 2 Rotenberg plants can‚Äôt physically fulfil the orders for weapons.

What was previously supplied mainly from Slovenia, Finland and Germany is now cut off.\n\nIf Ukraine manages to hold the Russians off for 10 days, then the Russians will have to enter negotiations.

Russia‚Äôs war represents an assault on fundamental international rules and norms that have prevailed since the Second World War, which we are committed to defending,‚Äù a joint statement read.\n\n‚ÄúWe will hold Russia to account and collectively ensure that this war is a strategic failure for Putin.‚Äù\n\nAnd it added: ‚ÄúAs Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies. We will implement these measures within the coming days.‚Äù\n\nThe decision to trigger the action came after the EU, which was previously split on the matter, decided to move forward with it.\n\nIn removing the Russian banks from Swift, the leaders said the move would, ‚Äúensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally.‚Äù\n\nAnd the group said it was prepared to take further action against Russia and Mr Putin.\n\n‚ÄúWe stand with the Ukrainian people in this dark hour. Even beyond the measures we are announcing today, we are prepared to take further measures to hold Russia to account for its attack on Ukraine,‚Äù the statement concluded.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, took to Twitter to confirm the latest move against Russia.\n\n‚ÄúFirst, we commit to ensuring that a certain number of Russian banks are removed from SWIFT. It will stop them from operating worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports,‚Äù she tweeted.\n\nThe Biden administration had faced calls from Ukraine and US lawmakers in Congress for Russia to be removed from Swift after Putin launched the unprovoked attack on Thursday.\n\nFollowing the announcement, a senior administration official said that the White House was ‚Äúcommitted to fully implementing sanctions‚Äù towards Russia and the country‚Äôs elites and that the US government would ‚Äúgo after their yachts, their luxury apartments, their money and their ability to send their kids to fancy colleges in the West.‚Äù\n\nThe official said that the administration would also target ‚ÄúGolden passports‚Äù that ‚Äúallow wealthy Russians connected to the Russian Government to become citizens in certain countries, and gain access to our financial systems. Any current or future sanctioned individual trying to flee the impact of our sanctions by buying their way into western citizenship will be forced to endure the consequences of supporting Putin‚Äôs war of choice.‚Äù\n\nThe final list of Russian banks that are de-Swifted will be determined by the EU as the system is under Belgian jurisdiction.\n\nEdit:\n\n[succinct huffpost](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/swift-banking-sanctions-russia-ukraine-invasion_n_621aa4aee4b0afc668c15b94?mnk)\n\n[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/heavy-fighting-kyiv-outskirts-russia-ukraine-signal-possibility-talks-2022-02-26/) << of note: ‚ÄúThe sanctions, agreed with the United States, France, Canada, Italy, Great Britain and the European Commission, also include limiting the ability of Russia's central bank to support the rouble.‚Äù",

It might save invaluable lives. Stay safe everyone.\n\nUrban warfare tips from a former Marine. I am a former U.S. Marine and am of Ukrainian ancestry. I can‚Äôt even believe I am making a post like this and it will probably get buried, but if someone has the ability to translate it to Ukrainian please do. I fought in Iraq and was an urban warfare instructor.For the defenders of Kyiv, here are a few tips I can offer that I can say worked in Iraq (to the Iraqis advantage) :\n\n1.) Stay out of the steet. 2.) Stay out of street. 3.) For the love of God, stay out of the street. The worst place to be in an urban warfare environment is to be outside.\n\n4.) Doors are called ‚Äúthe fatal funnel.‚Äù It is human nature to try and enter through a door. Aim all your weapons at the door to maximize the number of kills.\n\n5.) Block the door from the inside with anything you can, furniture, chairs, booby-traps (explosives). The idea is to make the invaders think the door isn‚Äôt blocked. That way when they try to enter they remain exposed for the longest amount of time possible. 6.) Stairways are another good killing zone. Block stairways with any obstacles you can to slow down invaders. 7.) if you throw grenades downstairs, have your magazine fully topped off and ready. The invaders will most likely run up the stairs to run past the grenade blast. You‚Äôll need all the ammo you have to gun as many down as possible.\n\n8.) When possible, cut small holes in the floor into the rooms below to fire into. People breaching rooms will look for threats directly in front of them and usually don‚Äôt look above or below until last.\n\n9.) Don‚Äôt sling your weapon around your body. If things go hand-to-hand it will hinder you.\n\n10.) Have a knife, spade, or club close by and readily available. If you have to fight hand-to-hand it‚Äôs much more handy than a rifle.\n\n11.) Never fire from the same window twice.\n\n12.) Never stick the muzzle of your rifle outside of a window. Don‚Äôt expose it.\n\n13.) Shoot from deep inside the room out of the window. It will help hide the muzzle flash and reduce the noise making it hard to tell where it came from.\n\n14.) If you wound an enemy, don‚Äôt kill him. Let his friends come to help him. Moving a wounding a soldier means it will take 4 men out of the fight to carry him away. That‚Äôs four less rifles firing at you.\n\n15.) Shoot the men trying to evacuate the wounded soldier. It will demoralize them and take even more men out of the fight to evacuate him.\n\n16.) Keep as many carbohydrates on you and remember to eat and hydrate. Urban warfare is incredibly intensive.\n\n17.) Keep moving. Never stay in one spot very long.\n\n18.) One very accurately placed shot can hold up a lot of people for a very long time. You don‚Äôt have to be a sniper. You just have to convince them there is one in the area.\n\n19.) Utilize the sewers in subways to move whenever possible.\n\n20.) Whenever possible, try to let other friendlies know where you are at to avoid friendly fire. It‚Äôs very easy to start shooting at each other in an urban environment.\n\n21.) It may be consuming, but take the tracers out of your ammunition supply and refrain from using them.\n\n22.) have one magazine of all tracer rounds. Use this magazine only when you need to let everyone else (friends) know where an enemy is located at. (Across the street, in a park, which window). After using it run like hell and get away from where you just were.I don‚Äôt know what else to write, and I hope to God none of you ever have to use it. God be with you all. As someone with Ukrainian ancestry it tears me apart to not be able to be there with you.Glory to Ukraine.Edit: A few extras.\n\n23.) Ammunition goes fast. Conserve what you have.\n\n24.) 10 men firing from several different buildings can appear to be a small army and stop a lot of people.\n\n25.) Rip down street signs, deface building names, and do anything to strip the identity of where you are at. This will add confusion to an invading force.\n\n26.) Evacuate your wounded in a timely manner possible.\n\n27.) if the enemy suddenly pulls back, GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE AREA. It doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre winning. It means they are going to call and heavy artillery or an air strike on your position.\n\n28.) if you are going to lose an area, poison common water supplies. Most likely an enemy will try to refill their supplies at the closest source.\n\n29.) Cluster your booby traps in close proximity to create paranoia.\n\n30.) Always keep on the move. Never stay in the same place for long\n\nEdit: formatted for ease of reading.\n\nEdit Edit: I am not the OP",
