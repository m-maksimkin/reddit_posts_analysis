Our own media gives us the narrative that resonates with us, and their media gives the narrative that resonates with Russians.

            "text": "Putin has been saying for years that he wants another cold war. It’s the only way to get back leverage lost after the Cold War. He has specifically said so. The west should be given a heads up that there is a possibility Putin is going to provoke America and NATO into firing a shot so he is justified taking out the nukes and pointing them. Then he will have those Cold War tensions that he has been talking about. I think the west should be warned and even tell the Russian people that this is where we are heading. Appeal to the humanity of the Russian people. We shouldn’t go 40 years backwards in one week   \n\n\nLook how he has been saying for over 10 years like this video clip in five years. I want mutually assured destruction. It’s the only way to get back on average we lost.  Look how they even in the first week start mentioning nukes and World War III. And look how difficult a country like Korea with nukes is to deal with? Putin is willing to risk it all and even destroy the lives of his people for another 10 or 15 years if it helps get china and Russia some leverage back. And they’re playing the long game. They figure in the long run it’s worth it. Which I disagree with. But it’s not about Ukraine\n\nFor Putin it’s a long game with his people’s livelihood. As it’s always been with communists.  \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo&t=115s  \n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cuban-missile-crisis-bring-russia-putin-190221190858809.html  \n\nThe next thing he will do is use the people he has manipulating media and politicians to start getting the west to want to war. Look at how Trump suddenly called the holocaust and Lindsey Graham said we should assassinate putin. Who put those ideas in their head?\n\nAnd Putin said he has hypersonic missile‘s. China has tested one. So they are out there. It means they can’t be detected. I believe this guy is crazy enough that if we fire a shot to get involved he’s going to send missiles that land on American soil for the first time. Plus little submarines are going to pop up in threatening places.\n\nThis guy is going all in. He would be willing to risk his people and his country and the stability of the world in order to protect his dictator ship, push down the west, and uplift Russia. Long term.\n\nSounds crazy but you can’t look at this through western eyes. Just look at what some of these people are saying. They are supporting him and completely brainwashed. Now China is saying America will attack Russia and China will be next. This sort of propaganda is very dangerous\n\n\nThis whole situation is. But Mark my words he’s trying to beat the west into a world war because he thinks - as he has stated Dash it’s the only way to get leverage back\n\n\nSo we can’t get provoked. Even when a nuclear facility is on fire. Even when the Ukrainian president is surrounded. In fact putin isn’t closing in right away on purpose. The more he can play on the heart strings of the west to get involved the more according to his plan\n\nIt would be western hubris to think that times have not changed. And after seeing China launch of hypersonic missile into space Dash it would be arrogance to think nobody else has the technology. Every action putin is taking and has taken for years has been leading up to this. It’s not something he will pack up and go away from after a few weeks or months￼",

And as of now, Russian “FokcyHews” is all that the ordinary Russians have to go by; it’s almost inconceivable, but for the time being, Russians are virtually the only ones in the whole world, that know NOTHING about what’s happening in Ukraine.\n\nThe question: why is Pukin’ so desperate to keep the truth from his own people, even as he is committing cultural “fratricide”?! Do they really give a crap if they prosper in an “empire”, and would they want their futures squandered on one lunatic’s delusion? Haven’t they been fleeced enough by him by now?!\n\nAnd haven’t enough innocent people, Ukrainians and Russians, suffer and die already?",

Once that happens, Putin will speed up the Union State project substantially and possibly push other ex-Soviet neighbors to join through a combination of incentives, diplomatic pressure, and military force. This will all culminate in the effective annexation of Belarus and Ukraine, and any other states that join, into Russia in ten to twenty years' time; effectively restoring something roughly approximating the Russian Empire/USSR's political borders. This approach puts a patina of consent on the annexations; making it the most legitimate route Putin has to annex Ukraine. Therefore, it's probably the one he'll choose, especially since outright annexation would further damn him in the eyes of the world.",

            "text": "My question is this, and it has been alluded to and likely already brought up or phrased another way with the same logic, but I’ll add my armchair $0.02 anyway;\n\nthe TL;DR is, Putin is BEYOND a bad faith actor, a thug without a shred of propensity towards humanity, integrity, conscience, reciprocity, honesty- willing to undertake quite literally any and all means available to him so long as they lead to the ends he seeks to achieve and maintain his fragile ego and personal sense of power and security. He has brazenly shown is hand on the world stage so many times committing so many acts of brutality and abominable, debased wholesale slaughter, deception, open assassination through poisoning of opponents- a sign of ultimate cowardice and maximal sociopathy,\n\nand because like many have brought up re: war and esp nuclear weapons, the onus always falls on humans and human governments and institutions of decency, empathy, integrity, to uphold their word and to give a fuck about people- a weakness that unfortunately is always exploited to the fullest extent possible in a worst-man wins race to the bottom game of chicken to which any compassionate and decent person cannot fathom sinking to.\n\nYet, Putin’s behavior is remarkably predictable and follows in patterns of conditioning that most mammals from dogs to children to grown ass men are susceptible to; He has effectively been rewarded for the most odious behavior imaginable, learned he can act with impunity, and now on the verge of possible senility and having gone this far, why are we pretending that our good faith laws and regulations and world order matter one single fuck in this situation? Diplomacy? That’s a joke to Putin;\n\nWe are weak, we are vulnerable because we care for people who are dispensable to him. History has shown that autocrats and tyrants cut from the same cloth as Put-ler respond only to negative reinforcement in the form of a show of force, massive humiliation, often requiring an active removal of the dictator from a position where they pose a threat; This man is holding the world hostage,  royally fucking up the entire world order in every way imaginable, because he is a paranoid, jingoistic, irredentist, psychopathic, senile feeble lunatic cartoonishly holed up in his supervillain bunkers and mansions at the ends of 50 foot tables.\n\nHe gives no shits about what our commitments are, those mean nothing to him and are merely opportunities for exploitation. He need only rattle the nuclear saber and its too risky to help Ukraine with air defense so we allow them to be bombed into oblivion. He now approves sending nukes to Belarus and giving them access to the Baltic; a LANDLOCKED country does not have a coastline, and Putin wasn’t promising to cede Russia’s territory to Lukashenko, he was telegraphing that The baltic states, close to St. petersburg and with large russian speaking populations are arguably next on his list of neo-Czarist conquests;\n\nThey are much smaller in territory and I see no reason why he shouldn’t go after them when he can shake the nuke stick and have the transatlantic alliance “breadcrumbing,” saying well now article V isn’t worth it for trivial countries like lithuania and latvia and estonia to risk nuclear war, so we will just deescalate; We are like a battered housewife who can’t break up with Putin, calling the police but then telling them it was our fault our husband beat the shit out of us. Enough is enough, logic and reason don’t have the cachet we think they do with someone with a severe Axis-II personality disorder who has a neurodegenerative brain disease or florid psychosis, which can be diagnosed by a freshman psych student who’s watched a few hours of news in the last few weeks honestly does anyone deny that the man was already without conscience and now likely without any inhibition or restraint?\n\nOn and on it goes; There’s a piece of symbolic parchment paper with symbolic quill tipped signatures that is supposed to deter him? We couldn’t let Ukraine in to NATO bc it would risk russian aggression, but aren’t we prepared to defend an attack on any member? Corruption issues for Ukraine’s joining NATO aside, I don’t see a difference nor how this isn’t appeasement, Chamberlain and Sudetenland 2.0.\n\nWhy , my thinking goes, would NATO risk the very same nuclear war that is so risky its out of the question to fire a shot at russia, for land that only differs in imaginary lines on a map, when we are willing to watch the wholesale massacre of innocents for fear of Putin’s saber rattling? This is a problem re: nuclear powers that is a band aid that will need to be ripped off at some point, and that point is sooner than later.\n\nHow is This NOT just kicking the goddam can down the road toward worse and more high stakes situations?\n\neventually, if he isn’t taken out by someone from his circle on the inside, I fail to see how there is an ending any better than a Ukraine in tatters and a US and NATO in a full scale war anyway;\n\nWe should have acted after Grozny,after Aleppo,after Crimea;Tyrants willing to stoop to the most heinously unconscionable of levels in committing barbarism are always going to exploit the rational,more responsible, compassionate, cooler heads who have responsibilities for safeguarding the worlds population and averting disaster,\n\nbut this is just a slow motion march to a destination we have a better chance of reaching & with less casualties if we beat him to the punch, act swiftly and decisively,\n\nand confront the complacent Russian bear—fat on its two decade+ spree of kleptocratic impunity resting comfortably, if a bit skittishly, atop its empire of looted honeycomb—We must take this evil fuck by surprise and put the Bear into eternal hibernation.",
