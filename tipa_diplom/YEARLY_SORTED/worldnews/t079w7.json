It led to poverty and famine in the country. They couldn't pay their debts. Causing France to even come and seize things from people's homes. Which opened the way to fascist nationalism...  \n\n\nNo idea, what other solutions there can be though. Other countries or NATO get involved, and that sparks WW3. Heavy sanctions, then Putin likely feels there's nothing to lose by going after other countries. Do nothing, the rest of the world looks weak and ripe for the taking.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFucking Hell...

            "text": "\nMy take on NATO‚Äôs strategy here. Putin‚Äôs expansionist policy has been clear for more than a decade now. Thus far, he has been careful to steer around NATO and come up with decent pretenses for his actions that at least placate his subjects. Ukraine is a bold step in his policy, but really the only logical one in terms of Putin‚Äôs logical madness. \n\nNATO saw this coming, and the U.S. saw it coming since at least 2014. They saw that expansionist Russian policy would eventually lead to invasion of any unprotected, former soviet states. Ukraine was Putin‚Äôs obvious choice. NATO also saw that an invasion of Ukraine would provide the pretense to topple the Russian regime and press restart, much like the fall of the USSR. In the event of this restart, a new chance for democracy and capitalism in Russia awaits. \n\nWhen toppling the regime of a nuclear state, outright war is off the table, but economic war is a powerful weapon as well. Cutting off all of the assets Russia has intertwined with the EU and U.S. over the last two decades would be disastrous for Russian morale, and the people of nations stricken by poverty do not historically like war for very long. An unstable Russian society is a very dangerous one for the ruling class, as history shows. \n\nThe issue remained, however, that the EU, and NATO need that pretense in order to implement economic war on Russia. Quite simply put, they needed Russia to invade a friendly sovereign state not in the EU or NATO, and Ukraine was chosen as the sacrificial lamb. As Putin‚Äôs ambitions grew, and Russia became more prosperous, they became intertwined with Europe‚Äôs economics. Perhaps he saw this as being to his advantage in keeping them from interfering with his future plans. In reality, in played into NATO‚Äôs hand beautifully. The more Russia involved itself, the more vulnerable they became. When Russia finally decided to strike, a large part of their economy would in fact be at the total mercy of the EU. \n\nAs Russia escalated their aggressive behavior, culminating with their build up on the Ukrainian border, the rest of the world watched in real time. Western media made sure that the public knew exactly what was happening up to the minute. Ukraine pleaded for peace, the EU, U.K.  and U.S. denounced Putin and public sentiment shifted toward the globally broadcast plight of Ukraine. Putin was probably surprised. So much attention, but so little promise of repercussion. The West promised sanctions, and sent arms to Ukraine, but for all intents and purposes they left Ukraine on its own. He dipped his toes just a bit by sending peace keepers to ‚Äúcontested‚Äù regions. The western response was rather impotent sanctions, and solidified the apparent stance of NATO as a bystander. Putin was now in a position where he must either invade and face a united Western world that viewed him as a tyrant and sympathized with Ukraine but seemed unlikely to interfere, or else back off and loose face with the public at home. His egotism won. \n\nWith Russian war on Ukraine declared in earnest, planes shot down, and boots marching to battle Russia is now in an irreversible track to economic ruin. The west will play the long game. They will sacrifice Ukraine to bleed Russia dry of money and public support. The sanctions are severe and will grow worse. There is no international ally with real reason to help Russia. They are alone. Putin‚Äôs circle will grow small and eventually wither. Putin has led his Oligarchs and citizens into a siege that will only be broken when he is dethroned. \n\nThe west wants the reset button to be pressed, and they believe the time is coming soon. Will the oligarchs force Putin out, force a return to the status quo, and hope that the west will back off sanctions? Will the military lead a coup when they see their funds running dry? Will the people of Russia rise against tyranny? Or will Putin back into his corner and fight with a disregard for humanity, leading to unbelievable human death? The west doesn‚Äôt know, and isn‚Äôt deeply concerned. They just want that reset button pressed. When it is, they will do their best to bring Russia under sway. Time alone will tell if it works.\n\nEdit: I am pro Ukrainian sovereignty and autonomy (to joint NATO or do whatever the hell they like). I do not approve of them being used in the way they are.

What did the sanctions following the 2014 annexation of Crimea do? That's right, fuck all. The West is so dependent on Russia for oil and natural gas that they'll come back like a thirsty dog in the desert. It's the equivalent of just telling a child who misbehaved 'bad boy, don't do it again! no more cookies for you!' Putin knows this and that's why he proceeded. They'll never impose meaningful sanctions on Russia, at least not sanctions from which Russia is unable to recover. I suspect they have been planning for this for years and know which critical loopholes can be exploited. Although sanctions can badly damage the economy, they clearly haven't been enough to stop Putin.
