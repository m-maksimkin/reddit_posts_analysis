            "text": "You know what gets me is Putin and Biden are kinda the same, they both wanna war they both dont trust their own staff and everyone wants to assassinat them. Biden alone wants us to get involved in this war and he starts with spiking Americas prices to \"Teach Putin a lesson\" like we got the stupidest presidency in the world along side of Putin. \n\nTheres also a loop goin on, everytime Americans get their raises and SSI check increases theres a war and everything goes up, gas is $5 a gal. Foods more expensive, materials cost way more, so living pay became once again unlivable because the world wide government doesnt want middle class citizens to live, We're just here to do our job and vote for the most corrupt then when they dont need us anymore they toss us away like garbage. USA is a joke when your not rich or a celebrity, good luck finding a place to live and making enough money unless your not white. \n\nWar makes us suffer, No war gives improvement in the world. Enjoy realism",

One of them even commenting “no nazi will survive, glory to Putin” haha. It’s almost as if there is a significant lack in education. So many red flags for a poor leader, he’s hidden, no public appearances, replacing staff, odd meetings with his inner circle, arresting protesters. Even back further.

In the end he's basically painted a huge target on himself and there isn't a table long enough in Russia to change that fact.  Changing 1,000 members of his personal staff is not the smartest thing to do, it was probably the stupidest thing he could do and  only brings the end closer and my guess is it will be someone in his inner circle or a general that will take him out.  History has shown over time that if you live by the sword, you often die by the sword and crazy Vladdy has lived his life by the sword.",

According to a source who works in the upper echelons of a Russian ministry, Putin in February allegedly sacked the some 1,000 people—from cooks to launderers to secretaries to bodyguards—who catered to his daily personal and professional needs, and replaced them with a new group of attendants.\n\nWith no actual source this feels pretty flimsy, like the kind of celebrity “scoops” you get from US Weekly. “Somebody close to Kim Kardashian says she’s pissed so-and-so wore the same look on the red carpet.” \n\nI’m tempted to say this is fake news/propaganda.",

In addition, Copetas’ only source in *his* recent reporting is an anonymous one “inside a Russian ministry,” which is so vague it could mean almost anything. As such, no other news outlet on earth has verified this source or this reporting. \n\nAll of this can be googled within five minutes. I did not even know who Copetas was ten minutes ago. \n\nBut even if you don’t bother to check the source, the 1,000 number is ridiculous on its face if you just think about it even a little bit. Not even emperors and kings have personal staffs so huge. Not to mention, we know - because these reports actually *have* been verified - that during covid Putin has reduced his personal staff to a skeleton crew and does not allow *anyone* within 20 feet of his person at any time, with very rare exceptions. \n\nSure, Putin is paranoid. Sure, he likely vets, re-vets and replaces as necessary any and all staff he finds suspicious. Sure, he likely has taste testers for his food. But these have likely been his practices for 20+ years already. To replace 1,000 staff suddenly and overnight would be a huge projection of weakness to Putin’s enemies within, and that’s precisely what he’s trying to avoid to hold onto power. \n\nSo, while dozens of you are wasting breath arguing about whether firing 1,000 staff suddenly was a paranoid, dumb or desperate move by Putin, just remember: there’s not even any reason to think this event actually happened as described.",

He’s always been at the corners of the spotlight since he came into office, but has earned himself quite a bit of international infamy as of late. A few weeks ago Putin launched an assault on a neighboring country, Ukraine, and no matter how many sanctions the international community places on Russia, it appears that he’s not too keen on giving up his doomed invasion, he’s desperate, and most likely believes that if he goes down, he might as well take everyone with him. Fearing a poisoning from his staff and inner circle who aren’t too on board with the invasion, he has recently replaced a thousand of his staff with new workers as to foil any budding plans of a sabotage, this is where you come in. Our client is a disgruntled member of Putin’s old staff who wants the President knocked off his ivory tower, and before his termination, managed to get you a place among Vladimir’s new cooking staff, the Kremlin will be swarming with security. One target, and a building chock-full of guards, polonium, and instruments of murder, from an outside perspective it may seem like an impossible task.

Declare war on the world like nazy germany did? Everyones shut you out so you have no food no money, nothing.. a rat in a corner with other rats will eventually eat each other than then when only ones left, it'll just attack because there's nothing left to lose and everything to gain.\n\nGeting worse and worse and each day i open my internet hoping to see \"Putini assassinated\" or \"Russaian Coup underway, Putin nowhere to be found, Russias collapse underway\" etc etc.\n\nImagine russia under a political party like the ukraine where they are free, no corruption or at least very little and it continues to be hunted out like weeds in a yard and removed, so on and so on.\n\nItll take a generation maybe two, but they'd get there. And the quality of life impact and the changes we would see would be incredible. China woulda be left all alone with north Korea and they are fighting their own battles with hong kong and taiwan etc.\n\nWe can all hope Russia under its current rule and regime will fall just ikee the USSR fell back in the day.\n\nWhat a wonderful day  that would be, and the world would be so much better from that point on.\n\nPlus russians would finally see what they haven't been allowed to see and what russia really is doing and saying to its people versus what its really doing and saying to the rest of the world.\n\nGod i wish they would rise up and revolt and that country would fall into chaos and all the corrupt politicians and business folks would just fall under the hammers of justice and they could get back control from a bunch of kleptocratic psychopaths that are more or less a gas station masquerading as a country. \n\nSomeday.

The thing I hate the very most about liars is they start to believe their own bullshit. Putin: ain't nobody trying to kill you bro?! Is this your guilty conscience speaking to you? Are you fearing the same fear of death as the women & children & innocent people who's deaths you are responsible for? It takes a real piece of shit to drop bombs on pretty much his own people. I get they're two separate countries & they hate each other, but essentially, borders are imaginary lines & just a short time ago, the imaginary lines & the people there were all considered part of Russia, like not long enough for genetic diversification to change them even slightly. My point is, this man is essentially killing his own people in order to reacquire land that used to be theirs. I can't help but wonder how long until he is asking for Alaska back, or how long until somebody in a nato country gets something done to them on purpose or accident. & the fact that this paranoid motherfucker thinks that we are giving Ukraine any sort of weapon, let alone nuclear any thing, & firing 1000 people over his guilty conscience really makes me think about this whole situation in a totally different way",

As we see that his only hope of prevailing is with quantity - since his military forces lacks quality, the reverse is true should he resort to the proven unthinkable weapon.  \n\nGiven the stream of strategic blunders and technical weaknesses that betray any claim of \"modern\" or \"advanced\" fighting forces or weapons, we must plan for the worst - that Putin's nuclear firepower is equally kludgy and by no means \"tactical\" - that is, he cannot be expected to detonate some small fission warhead above a single city but is most likely to have only the most basic - high-load, no-aim - warheads.  \n\nAs such, should he want to survive, he can't afford to split the atom.  At the same time, he has gone sufficiently far to make himself increasingly a pariah in his own bunker.  For the sake of humanity, we can only hope someone or something inside stops him, and soon.",
