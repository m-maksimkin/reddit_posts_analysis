Poor poor Russian civilians and no mentions of Ukrainians.  \n\nHell Iv even seen many saying we should not be blaming the Russian military either, the military is just an innocent victim in all this as well those poor poor innocent things. Just doing what they are told. \n\nThere is a massive online campaign going on right now and seeing how fucking gullible people are over the last couple years it will have an impact\n\nEdit: It seems it already is. Lots of what appear to be genuine accounts in this thread are saying the only non military action that can be taken is akshully a really bad no no thing because Russia wont like it and it will make them mad while forgetting the reason for the sanctions existing at all. And not even entertaining the thought that Russia can pretty much stop all this from happening today.",
