            "text": "‘Ukrainian authorities say’\n\nListen, I’m not saying this didn’t happen. We KNOW Putin has had threats assassinated in the past, and while I wouldn’t put it past him if he felt he ‘had’ to take out Zelensky, it would definitely be a departure from his former assassinations. Again, not saying Putin wouldn’t green light such a plan, it WOULD remove an obstinate, unreasonably so IMO, opponent, but at a SEVERE cost. It wouldn’t demoralize his enemies, ESPECIALLY in Western Ukraine, and would come with even more international condemnation, but it is also clear that Zelensky, with pretty much the full backing of every Western institution, has felt emboldened to lie, deceive, warmonger, yet play victim, yet can do so with the expectation that almost anything he says or does will be deified, censored, or misconstrued (depending on the circumstance) on his behalf on the international stage. \n\nUnless you speak Russian or Chinese, who also otherwise have their own internet and media spheres (VK and Russian TV for Russia, literally everything for China), you will not be exposed to anything else. There are few to no Russian shills spouting contrarian positions, especially compared to their competitors (China dominates that realm, but you’ll never hear about it because they are actually competent) and even official Russian foreign media is straight up being censored in the West (not that RT or Sputnik was winning over many people anyways). At least this article states ‘ACCORDING TO UKRANIAN OFFICIALS’, and is a real news article instead of some op-ed spreading allegations as fact, but I doubt many here will take this as anything less than gospel. \n\nAgain, not saying this didn’t happen, but even if it did, it would reflect absolute desperation on Russia’s behalf. I think it is pretty clear what is happening and what Russia’s ‘plan’ was with this invasion was. The first ‘wave’ wasn’t really an invasion, it was partly a show of force, but more than anything, it was an open declaration of hostility, a move to accomplish two things (that didn’t happen). One was to scare and bully Ukraine into submission without actually doing much damage or killing anyone. The second was the deluded idea that the Russian speaking East would flock to the Russian ‘invaders’ and embolden them to fight for Russia. Yea, that didn’t happen, but I think Russia thought they could possibly could come in, scare Kiev into submitting to their demands (the goal of the Western ‘invasion’) and with the Eastern ‘invasion’, seize key strategic assets and create a Russian Hezbollah of sorts to permanently represent Russian interests in Ukraine. Instead, in absence of any serious fighting, Ukraine just bragged about how they were whooping Russia’s ass and the ‘Ghost of Kiev’ was purging the Kiev airspace of Russian aircraft with their godlike piloting and combat skills. Didn’t matter if it was true or not, because so long as the rest of the West hated Russia and Russia had no control over 'the narrative', they would relish in such an underdog David vs Goliath success story. Oh, and for the East, yea, the Russian army isn’t even welcome there, much less celebrated and embraced like Putin hoped. \n\nSo yea, I think Putin hoped he’d have Ukraine in his pocket now, but instead he’s been forced to escalate the conflict into a REAL invasion. I’m still not convinced he’d attempt to assassinate Zelensky (unless he could TRULY hide and deflect blame), but it is clear that Russia is becoming desperate in ways we haven’t seen before. When Putin assassinated his enemies before, even on foreign soil, they were ALWAYS still Russian nationals. He also barely even hid it, choosing fucking polonium as his poison of choice. He’d deny it publicly of course, but by using polonium (which is hardly practical), he was effectively advertising that it was he beyond almost all doubt who did it, likely as a warning to other potential rogue oligarchs. \n\nI don’t like making long comments like this, I just wished there was more nuanced and emotionally driven discourse over this. Russia might have everything to win or lose over this, but for the West, Russia’s loss will mean China’s gain. China has already displayed flagrant disregard to international sanctions and willingness to step in as a buyer for discounted resources. Russia is NOT Iran though, who they bought discounted oil from. Not only does Russia have the O/G that China NEEDS, they share a large border and have a myriad of OTHER valuable resources. Russia also offers a convenient military ally for China in MANY ways (European position and Eurasia positioning, superior nuclear submarines/tech (China's only look good on paper, too loud), superior rockets and ICBMs/tech (China still uses liquid fuel), and of course, a massive nuclear arsenal). While Russia may not have the capital, they are relatively free of Western coercion, with no US bonds on their books anymore. Meanwhile, China while China's lock on the yuan prevents it from competing as a reserve currency (intentionally for the sake of control, though it's slowly loosening), it is still capital rich with MASSIVE forex savings. That's not something China wants to share with Russia, and has dwindled for the sake of capital control even as inflation has devalued the fund, but beggars can't be choosers and China could easily replenish the fund with Russia's resources should Russia desire foreign currencies badly enough. It's dire enough to the point that state-funded Chinese think-tanks don't even question if Chinese benefit is a forgone conclusion. Rather, they are going as far to say that China aside, the agreement will be so strong that the sanctions will HURT the US and it's allies more than it will hurt Russia. That's a bold statement, and I'm not really convinced by it (could just be sweet-talk targeting Russia with some nice, but misleading numbers to back it up), but regardless, despite no open statements, it is clear that China is VERY happy with these developments, and probably cares little if Russia wins or loses this war (I don't even know if there will be any clear 'winners' or 'losers'). This think-tank report is already addressing the subject in clear terms, and considering it has been publicly released (in an otherwise secretive nation), it's obviously made for Russian ears. Honestly though, the government doesn't even have to say anything, PRC nationalists are celebrating online. This is the Chinese clearnet mind you, which China does it's best to control with an iron grip, not just allowing, but steering the discussion towards certain subjects with certain opinions. The Chinese people and government seem lock-and-step with the idea that a hurt Russia will become a certain asset. Given the circumstances, there is absolutely no world a crippled Russia will turn to the enemies it has only become more hostile with and beg for lenience, not with China next door willing to offer everything they need, with strings attached of course.\n\nAs for what I think, as an American, yea, war is bad and all, but Yemeni lives matter just as much as Ukrainian ones. Almost 400k Yemeni are dead now, victims of a ruthless massacre from our 'ally' Saudi Arabia, killed with American weapons and American technology. As an American, I will NEVER support my country’s hypocritical foreign policy unless we use our power to end wars period, rather than weighing the cost of lives in dollars. America is not a peacekeeper, yet our leaders use moral language publicly to describe our 'enemies' and to describe our 'allies'. I'd rather that rhetoric be rooted in reality, not propaganda, or at very least for our government to drop this 'beacon of freedom' bullshit and just admit that we're warmongers and manipulators, even if for pragmatic purposes. Even then though, my country can't even do that right. Instead, I've watched my country fight for lost causes and humiliating results, unsure if even the warmongering political elite even benefit from them (exception to Dick Cheney and his homies at Haliburton), much less American political interests, and even the less the everyday American, who is left footing the bill, or in some cases enlisting to die for these deceptions as an ends to a means. We all know the military targets the poor and marginalized to do their dirty work, and gone are the days where even men from wealthy and powerful families, like George W. Bush Sr, risked their lives fighting for their country, and almost every American from the old WASP elites to the Jim Crow discriminated blacks risked their lives in battle together and shared the tradition of military service firsthand, a time when shows like MASH aired on TV, making light of the harshness of war that all American families, regardless of background, knew together. Perhaps that is why our leaders are so out of touch on matters of war. \n\nEven now, they played a role in antagonizing Russia into making this circumstance a reality, using our power to pull The Ukraine away from Russia and towards the EU/NATO, knowing full and well the strategic value of The Ukraine to Russia, and that Russia would not let control of the nation be pried from their grip with anything besides staunch resistance. It's not just Putin, Russia is like a drug addict with an incurable habit, and the Black Sea is their methadone maintenance. Every time Russia loses access to the Black Sea, or even faces the prospect of losing access to it, they go apeshit. Seriously, it happens like ever 100 years or so, and Russia will go absolutely nuts to have access to it's warm water ports. Just let him have his warm water port.",

After all, what would the point of NATO post Soviet Union be if Russia, it’s “enemy”, that it wanted to take oil and gas profits from were included in it? NATO has no reason to exist anymore but it still does because it’s a military alliance that attacks countries which don’t do the bidding of the US. \n\nHypocrisy at its worst is that in 2010 the US gave uranium to Russia in exchange for Clinton Foundation donations in the Uranium One deal. Also during the Obama administration, the CIA helped overthrow the democratically elected Ukrainian government and Victoria Newlund hand selected the new leader who was a corrupt billionaire that acted as a puppet for the west. After this coup d’etat, a civil war ensued which is what we are seeing play out currently. Shortly after the coup, Biden’s son received a lucrative position on a Ukrainian gas company board in an industry he knows nothing about after being dishonorably discharged from the military for a crack addiction. It’s a human thing to develop an addiction but most crack addicts have their life fall apart, not receive an incredibly well paying job. Hunter Biden even admitted that he was put on the board because of his family name. \n\nIn 2015, Russia and Ukraine signed the Minsk Accord which promised a ceasefire and elections in the Donbas region AKA Donetsk and Luhansk regions which are mostly composed of Russian speaking citizens with Russian passports. In exchange, the Russians would hand over control of the border patrol to Ukraine. No ceasefire or elections ever took place. Adding insult to injury, Zelenskyy, who was elected in a landslide on a campaign of promoting peace and even spoke Russian in his campaign, approved a measure to have all Ukrainian news be broadcast in Ukrainian. The military, which utilizes fascist Neo-Nazis in the Donbas region, then started killing innocent civilians which spoke Russian for protesting to have referendums because they consider themselves more Russian than Ukrainian.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, the Russians and Germans created the Nordstream 2 pipeline which runs directly from Russia to Germany. It is a liquified natural gas pipeline and the US is now one the top exporters of this gas. The US will go to any means to prevent Europe from getting its LNG from Russia as opposed to the US even though the Europeans would pay much less getting it from Russia than having it shipped across the Atlantic.\n\nI don’t support the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine because it definitely violates UN charters but the media is giving ZERO context of the situation. Either they’re ignorant, think we’re too stupid to make our own decisions with the whole truth or are lying to manufacture consent for a war to make US corporations rich. Funny how people who pride themselves on being against discrimination of minorities will do it in a heartbeat about all Russians. The reality is many Russians are protesting the invasion as well. Life is not so black and white. If people are enraged by this illegal war, then they should also be against the numerous illegal wars the US has waged in the past 80 years causing 6 million deaths in the past 20 years alone. Not a single one has been voted on by Congress thus making every single one unconstitutional. Economic sanctions also cause innocent civilians to die in scary high numbers. If our government doesn’t like the way a country operates, they should convince them with ideas that actually work, not brute military force. That is the way Nazi Germany behaved.",
