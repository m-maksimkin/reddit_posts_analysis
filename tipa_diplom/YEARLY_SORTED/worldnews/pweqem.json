For example, eggs are now printed with a code you can check to see when the egg was produced, what farm it came out of, and what kind of environment the chicken that produced the egg lives in based on how much space each chicken has.

Things like people stealing pets from others so they can eat them for a dog meat festival, or skinning the animal alive, listening to it shriek in agony, those kinds of things I would consider wrong even if it was cows or chickens or pigs.  I don't believe there is anything inherently wrong about eating meat, but one shouldn't be needlessly cruel, obtain the animal through legal means, kill it as quickly and painlessly as you can, and then process it cleanly and asepticly.",

Dogs have literally evolved by mankind’s side for at LEAST tens of thousands of years. They are hyper developed as human companions and no other animal on earth can compare to that. That’s not just some appeal to emotion, it’s historical fact. They are bred on a genetic level to be a human companion. Other animals are not.\n\nYes, other animals are fully capable of giving and receiving love and affection, and they even share some of the more appealing traits of dogs, but my stance is that they simply can never measure up to the shear amount of hyper focused human companion traits.\n\nThese other animals, did they hunt with us? Watch over our children? Defend our property? Lick our wounds? Learn complicated commands to complete our jobs? Keep us warm at night? Find us buried in the snow? Alert others of us being in danger? Wait for years in the same spot they last saw us? Live in our homes? I'm just coming up with more of these as I sit here. There is truly no comparison.\n\nEDIT: All them downvotes and only one good counterpoint. Come on reddit, if you are going to downvote then be brave and say something. WHY do you disagree?",

It’s my understanding that as the dog meat business is waning, these dogs are being left, or at the very least being half heartedly kept, fed scraps and chained up. The rescue we got him from is a small operation, just a couple and I’m guessing some friends that help when needed. The dog we got is a mixed breed Jindo. I’m not going to sit on a high horse and talk down about people that eat animals other than those we in NA eat. Food is food, meat is meat. A cow can be just as sweet and loving as a dog. The issues I see with the ban are, the industry itself seems to be dying off on its own and once banned, these dogs will need loving homes that can handle some of the trauma they’ve been through and that is very difficult sometimes. That being said, the dog we got is possibly one of the best dogs I’ve encountered. He never barks, he’s adorable and very well behaved, reasonably obedient although his recall sucks and if there’s a squirrel you could put a steak in his face and he wouldn’t divert his attention. It was also far easier than trying to adopt locally as the demand here is insane and most applications aren’t even looked at because the shelters/rescues are overwhelmed.",

I find it hard to compare the two with eachother",

When I visited I would have sampled it if I came across any place that served it that was also somewhat reputable.\n\nMy main concern and the better argument for it being illegal isn’t “omg it’s Fido how could you!?”  It is the fact that the dogs are neither wild nor truly farmed as far as I can tell. In PH I saw stray dogs all over the place and living in close proximity to people and obviously living off or garbage, going through trash and encountering human waste. It would seem like that would make them higher risk vectors for transmitting human diseases. Also would be scared of rabies from undercooked meat. If the dogs were raised like livestock to be served on the dinner table, no problem.\n\n-Edit-\nAlso how is this “world news”? It doesn’t affect anyone else outside of SK.

I’ve heard that most young Koreans that have eaten dog (a much smaller number these days) ate it during their military service.\n\nI’m pretty old (born in 1970) but I’ve never eaten dog and I saw a pretty traumatic incident that would have gotten me off the dog meat even if I stayed in Korea. When I was probably around 8 or 9, I saw a group of 4-5 guys leading a dog up a mountain.\n\nNSFW from here so don’t read if you’re squeamish.\n\nThe dog seemed happy enough to go on a stroll but they were taking the dog to cook it and eat it. They strung it up on a tree, beat it to death, and then charred the body on an open fire to burn off the hair, and dismembered it to cook. Something about the manner of death making it more tasty or something. Obviously, I was horrified. Not that I had a chance to eat a dog before we moved to the US, but the idea of eating a dog turns my stomach because I cannot remove that memory from the idea.\n\nI never criticize a culture for what they eat. I think food and culture are too intrinsically tied and often have the ancient basis in their very survival that it’s not for an outsider to judge. This goes for eating a dog too.

He’s not well-situated to be happy or successful as a pet, and living together has been tough sometimes. I’m excited about this because I don’t want dogs to be mistreated or eaten.

And it breaks my heart when people cannot realize that their puppy is the same thing as any animal in the animal agriculture system. It hurts even more knowing some farmers claim to be animal lovers and yet do these things. You can't love something and then slit it's throat. Love is nurturing and caring. Artificially impregnating a cow is not love. Taking away a mother cows child is not love. Taking her milk to be shipped off for your profit is not love. How is mutilating an animal love? They can claim to \"love\" and care for your animals all they want but in the end of the day love does not equate to death.
