Even after these events armenians as a whole were never persecuted for some extremists' actions. On the contrary ethnic armenians were still appointed into government offices and were even elected into the ottoman parliament (in 1912 elections even 3 members of the Tashnak party were elected, this party was literally named armenian revolutionary front and is still present within armenian politics, interestingly enough they refuse to open their records to the public).\n\nBut with the outbreak of World War one armenians had found the opportunity they were looking for, just like other minorities that gained their independence from ottomans before they joined their forces with an invading foreign army namely the Russians. As a result of this alliance armenians within the ottoman empire had started an outright terror campaign in the eastern anatolia. Burning of villages, killing of turks, ambushing of military supply convoys were commonplace events.\n\nIn light of these developments Ottoman authorities took measures to secure the security of frontline supplies and also prevent what was possibly the second ethnic cleansing of Turks after Balkan Wars. This measure was forced deportation, it was decided that armenians would be forcibly deported to damascus and mosul (Areas that were outside of significant turkish population centers). One of the most critical points of this decision was that armenians of Constantinople etc. were not subject to deportations. Surely if the Ottoman government had aimed to kill all armenians one of the largest population centers for armenians would not be excluded.\n\nDuring these forced deportations there were serious shortcoming in organization and supply. But this is no surprise considering that during the very same war in the very same region ottoman army would lose tens of thousands of its soldiers to exposure because they were unable to provide adequate winter clothing. In addition to supply problems local bandit groups would organize and attack the groups of armenians while they were on the road. This was mainly due to two factors: Revenge because of earlier armenian massacres against muslims and opportunism.\n\nTL;DR: There was no organized government act aimed at killing of armenians. This claim is neither backed by historical documents nor logic. After starting an ethnic conflict and allying with invading armies armenians lost and they were shown more mercy than they had shown their \"enemies\".",

Wonderful people who shared with me that the politics will be politics, that the Armenian lobbyers in the States may well go live in Armenia if they are that concerned, and that they consider themselves Turkish because they speak the Turkish language (as their primary language on a daily basis) and that they sing Turkish songs when they want to celebrate.\n\nMy second job required me to assist an Armenian delegation with their travel logistics during their political liaisons in Turkey.  Again, wonderful people. Despite being on a political mission, they were incredibly nice towards me and our team. Perhaps my younger self was expecting Armenian nationals to be colder than my first employers who identify as Turkish but that was not the case: It was as if their mission and the way they chose to interact with us during their daily dealings were totally sealed off - it was apparent that these two things had nothing to do with each other. \n\nI still have a couple of Armenian colleagues who are very vocal about Armenian-Turkish issues on their social medias, but never at work. To us, we are just colleagues and it always seemed to me like they have compartmentalised their issues with the Ottoman rule/Turkish government. I respect them for that but then again am unsure if they have another choice. \n\nIf you ask me should the Armenian Genocide be recognised I don‚Äôt have an answer - I don‚Äôt think history can be made without a dose of manipulation by the stronger thus I don‚Äôt trust the evidence presented by either side. \n\nBut what I am against is the fact that the politicians of today have no trouble using human disasters of yesterday (mind you, that are not a part of their nation‚Äôs history) as tools to exert power in their international affairs.  It is wrong to dangle genocides and war crimes for over decades whenever a viable ‚Äúoption‚Äù to discipline another country is needed. The Armenian Genocide recognition issue has been there for as long as I can remember myself (nearing 40 yo lol) so the States might as well recognise it and be done with it. \n\nIt is shameful to keep these tragedies as ammunition for political gains and incredibly disrespectful to those who suffered from these horrific events and their children who are scarred forever.  If you can‚Äôt put out the flame, then at least stop fuelling it.  Because you know what, without the politicians interfering, people have a better shot at solving their problems and getting along.\n\nEdit. Grammar and spelling",

Currently global Armenian population is ~11 million so if we got 11 million from the ~0.8 million survivors back then we had a population increase of 13.75x. Now if we say that no one died back then and we retained the ~2.3 million then the population would be ~31.6 million if we assume that the growth rate would have remained the same, and that is a big assumption. That would mean ~20 million potential souls were denied the chance at life by this single tragic event. What I‚Äôm getting at here is that maybe this calculation isn‚Äôt a 100%, I‚Äôm not even thinking about the 200k to 400k Armenians who died in the Hamidian massacres 20 years prior, or the 300k to 500k Armenians who fought in the red army 20 years later during WW2 with a good deal of them dying as a result, but it‚Äôs something I think about sometimes because as fucked as this whole situation is not only were over a million people killed but just imagine the millions of people who never got the chance to be born, the families never created, the communities never forged.

But it is no where near 1.5 million our history books says it's between 10-50k (can't remember the number but it's the civillian deaths. Killed gang nƒ±mber is something l≈üke 100k iirc).

European settlers literally butchered Native Americans for lands they had no right whatsoever and the high and mighty democratic USA still discriminates against them.\n\nLet's look at the most recent genocide, Jews that had done nothing to Germans, Germans just used them as scapegoats and took their riches and murdered them Jews didn't have any means to fight back and they were certainly not trying any national liberation movement.\n\nNow let's look at the ArmeniansThey were supplied by the RussiansThey were revolting against the Ottoman Empire, which they were citizens of...They even capture one of the biggest cities in the eastern Anatolia city of Van to handed it over to the Russians, if it wasn't for the Bolsheviks they would have succeeded too. They were attacking Ottoman Army from behind, sabotaging telegraph lines raiding villages, massing weapons. Then Ottoman Empire decides a forced migration to keep away Armenians from sensitive areas.**IMPORTANT!** Ottoman Empire didn't touch Armenians living elsewhere just the ones in the sensitive areas.\n\nIf you know anything about the last years of the Ottoman Empire then you know Ottomans were not even in the position to feed their own army and forced migration was a disaster as Armenians were not supplied enough and so many people wanting revenge raided convoys killed Armenians.\n\nBut! There was no systematic killing or even intention of systemic killing. It was war and you people always ignore innocent villagers killed by Armenian gangs.\n\nOver the years ASALA a terrorist Armenian organization killed many Turkish diplomats but you do not talk about them, do you?\n\nArmenians butchered innocents in Khojaly Massacre, but you don't bring that up, do you?\n\nThey were Armenian people in Nazi Army because they wanted to get rid of the Soviets but you do not talk about that, do you?\n\nAlso you people forget how after Balkan Wars Turkish population was forced from their homes as well but you dont call that genocide do you.\n\nClassical western hypocrisy at its best.\n\nFirst, atone for your own crimes, atone for Native Americans, Wounded Knee, African Americans, Indians, the Bengal Famine caused by your great and racist leader Churchill! and many others, most of those countries live in poverty because you people didn't allow them to progress, you didn't allow them to unite, took their natural resources, you delayed their development by at least 200 years.\n\nThe USA invaded Iraq for false claims about chemicals weapons and whatnot, only to secure oil resources of the middle east. You do not ask justice for Iraqi people now do you? All the cheap gasoline and fuel that you have in your cars, your machines, you heaters, that is because the U.S bled the blood of the innocents, bombed schools, and killed [children.](https://children.You) \"Foreign powers' constant intervention brought civil war to Syria which resulted in 3 million Syrian refugees coming to Turkey but you do not talk about that do you, you do not come us and say let's share the load, let's resettle those people over Europe and U.S.A. Hell Greece and many other European countries even denied access to refugees children drowned in the sea. But you are so civilized and humanitarian, right?\n\nIt is funny that you people support the U.S. government, it is clear as day that they always held the recognizing the Armenian Genocide claims as political agenda against the Turkish Government. BECAUSE that is what it is, a political topic not an actual historical topic that is viewed by historians. Don't you think it is convenient that the U.S. decides to call it a Genocide right after we bought weapons from Russians? Why did they not accept it before?\n\nListen to an expert of the middle east history Bernard Lewis\n\n\"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG70UWESfu4&ab\\_channel=armeniantale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qG70UWESfu4&ab_channel=armeniantale)\"\n\nYou will say he is paid by the Turkish people but, maybe a historian will make you doubt.\n\n**Now downvote me to hell, but remember as long as Turkish People live, not a single piece of land or compensation will be given to a single Armenian over false claims.**",
