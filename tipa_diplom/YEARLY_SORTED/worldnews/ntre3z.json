When he explained what he saw, his entire face began to involuntarily quiver. But when he got to the part where he said he saw a big picture of Hitler on the wall, he puffed his chest out and said \"I looked up at Mr. Hitler on the wall there, and I raised my pistol and shot him between the eyes.\" Even though it was just a picture, you could tell that act meant everything to him.\n\nThen he produced the picture, still in its frame, a nazi flag that flew over Auschwitz, and various items he picked up like medals, pins, knives etc.\n\nI cried when he spoke, and I got picked on terribly for it. But at that time I had just returned to America after having lived in the former Yugoslavian warzone for a year, as a little child. I was viciously raped there by militia men, and terrorized every breathing second of my life there by them, the sounds and sights of the still active war, and the knowledge that just 15-20 minutes away over the DMZ, the opposing military was actively committing Nazi styled genocide. Within 15 minutes of the town I lived in, there are no less than 5 mass graves from the ethnic cleansing that happened then.\n\nIn my mind, there is a clear legacy of nazism that has thrived since WW2, it lingered on in the Balkans and resparked into a decade long flaming inferno of genocide. Now I have seen that *exact* same philosophy growing here in America, and during the election season my PTSD was off the charts with how much the Trumper Q√ºlt walked & talked & lived as the genocidal militiamen. \n\nWe should all never forget the lessons of WW2, the pain of the concentration camps lives on and it's legacy has not been dropped from the hands of those with evil in their hearts.",

The first American soldiers, their faces ashen. Their eyes... I shall never forget their eyes. Your eyes. You looked and you looked. You could not move your gaze away from us. It was as though you sought to alter reality with your eyes. They reflected astonishment, bewilderment, endless pain and anger. Yes, anger above all. Rarely have I seen such anger, such rage contained, mute, yet ready to burst with frustration, humiliation, utter helplessness. Then, I remember, you broke down, you wept. You wept and wept uncontrollably, unashamedly. You were our children then, for we - the 12-year-old, the 16-year-old boys in Buchenwald and Theresienstadt and Mauthausen - knew so much more than you about life and death, man and his endeavors, God and His silence. You wept. We could not. We had no more tears left. We had nothing left. In a way we were dead, and knew it.\n\nQuote taken from William Hitchcock, The Bitter Road to Freedom, pg. 308.",

One building (shorter ones) could easily hold 100 or more people. They slept on wooden shelves stacked one on top of the other. They were bringing in people so fast that they resorted to wood buildings. Only the brick chimneys at each end remain.
