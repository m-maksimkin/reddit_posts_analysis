If you listen to Satan and his demons and aliens you would have helped him trap you in a bunker and then into the gates of hell, if you listened to God you would all be immortal by now, Satan with an apple in his mouth and truth finally revealed the enemy of satans poison and lies, and heaven reunited with earth in peace and joy.  God sees all, he is already here, he knows the day and the hour, his army his ready, his angels are ready, and it’s the snake move, Biden and Obama are in control of the White House, Lucifer and his pawns have control of what they think are nukes, but if they use them, they will fry everyone underground in Dulce, ruining their masters plan, so america is open season as long as Satans puppet is in charge to all nuclear powers.  They can’t launch them until Donald Trump is in charge, and Satan is exposed to do what he swore to do the first time before God, get rid of all of Gods and America’s enemies,  both Foreign and domestic, I say first Gods enemies, are the same as every nation and people on earth enemy,  Satan and his willing puppets, and put them in jail.  Expose about the aliens and Dulce and the truth.  If Satan can’t rig the next election, he will try to provoke a nuclear war.  The whole world and Gods army is descending on the United States and Britain, the most villainous, mass murdering and destructive puppets of Satan in history.\n\nWill the United States demand and go to war to extradite a guy who raped a 17 yr old girl in unholy Epstein lead satanic orgies, Satan wants prince Andrew, and he will go to war to get him, Satan wants the whole royal family, even Prince George and Harry, and little Archie, get them baptized Catholic and renounce that fraud of a false church started by 2 excommunicated Catholics.  And reconcile your subjects to the holy Catholic Church, for when Gods wrath, descends on the earth, he will strike down with furious anger all those false church’s and defiled alters, and as head of this “church of England” you and your family will be held accountable by God for leading so many astray and committing all sorts of evil acts in the name of God on behalf of Satan and his corrupted “church”.\n\nOnly the Holy Catholic Church will remain.",

Simply making it illegal to lie would change literally nothing except stop outright lies which hardly happen. What will continue to happen is what already occurs and that’s aversion of the truth. When questioned a politician will answer a question by avoiding answering the question. That saves them from having to ever lie on the first place. Plus, it’s hard to flat out regulate lies when you can play dumb or ignorant if you ever do end up getting pulled up and they actually take this regulation of lies seriously. \n\nMy heart goes out to the 99% who just watch idly when they know that leadership is awe fully dishonest. \n\nMy proposal would be a logic tree that visually represents what politicians are saying and whether their premises soundly support their conclusions. If not, maybe they get a little Red Cross ? Minus points for appeals to emotion, authority or other super common logical flaws that politicians are notorious for using.
