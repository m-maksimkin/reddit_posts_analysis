Area C constitutes 62% of the area, and approximately 365,000 people live in Israeli settlements. Palestinians who live in this area would be offered Israeli citizenship or permanent residency status (between 48,000, according to Bennett, and 150,000, according to other surveys).[54] Finally, Israel would invest in creating roads so Palestinians can travel between Areas A and B without checkpoints, and invest in infrastructure and joint industrial zones, because \"Peace grows from below — through people, and people in daily life\". Bennett also resists immigration of Palestinian refugees now living outside the West Bank, or the connection between the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In 2011 he noted that there were about 50 factories in the West Bank industrial region where Israelis and Palestinians work together, and cited this as one workable approach to finding peace between the two sides.[55]\n\nBennett suggests that Israel must learn to live with the Palestinian problem without a \"surgical action\" of separation to two states: \"I have a friend who's got shrapnel in his rear end, and he's been told that it can be removed surgically, but it would leave him disabled... So he decided to live with it. There are situations where insisting on perfection can lead to more trouble than it's worth.\" Bennett's \"Shrapnel in the butt\" thus quickly became widely known as representing his view of the Palestinian problem.[56][57]\n\nIn response to Israel's release of Palestinian prisoners in 2013, Bennett said Palestinian terrorists should be shot, allegedly adding, \"I already killed lots of Arabs in my life, and there is absolutely no problem with that\".[58] Bennett was widely condemned for these words,[59] though he denied saying them, claiming he said merely that \"terrorists should be killed if they pose an immediate life threat to our soldiers when in action\".[60]\n\nIn January 2013 Bennett said, \"There is not going to be a Palestinian state within the tiny land of Israel\", referring to the area from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea. \"It's just not going to happen. A Palestinian state would be a disaster for the next 200 years.\"[61",

Here's an expansion that I wrote below, since it has been asked for a lot. In Israel, you must get a majority of members in the parliament to form a government (usually 61/120). The forming coalition against Netanyahu is made of the following party leaders:\n\n* **Bennet:** Worked in Netanyahu's office before joining politics in 2013, fired because he's despised by Netanyahu's wife, Netanyahu tries to remove him from politics since then, using nasty and personal tricks.\n* **Lapid:** Served under Netanyahu in 2013, fired for \"conspiring a coup\".\n* **Sa'ar:** Served in Netanyahu's party since 2003, ran against him multiple times and lost, Netanyahu tried to get rid of him since.\n* **Liberman:** Formed a joint party with Netanyahu in 2014, claims to have been lied to and \"blocked from acting\" under Netanyahu.\n* **Gantz:** Ran against Netanyahu in 2020, promised by Netanyahu to become Prime Minister, betrayed and got nothing.\n* **Michaeli** and **Horovitz** have not worked with Netanyahu so far, but Michaeli's party have been lied to by Netanyahu multiple times, even in the current government (joined in favor of Gantz being Prime Minister).\n\nThey still don't have a majority, but if the Arab parties (10 seats) will not vote, they have enough. The Arab parties want to get rid of Netanyahu as much as these guys, so it's expected they will stay aside. Bennet is expected to be the Prime Minister for 2 years, and Lapid after him for 2 more years. Bennet is right winged and has only 6 seats, so the left winged parties (Michaeli and Horovits), as well as Lapid who got 17 seats, are lowering their heads, giving up on their ideologies to get rid of Netanyahu. This is how serious the situation is.",

But he is going in with a government that can support a more social and support to the people (which he share in some way even with the left wing parties, and even with the arab parties).   \n  \nThe whole point of this new government, beside removing the current PM, is to \"mend\" a lot of issues that the current one has placed. To reduce fear and hate mongering, to focus on local issues at hand. From employment to living quality to housing etc.  \nThey are not going to make any big changes or any big decisions regarding peace, or settlements etc.  \n  \nThe point is trying to give israel about a 1-2 years of \"rebuild\" time within in while netanyahu rot in his own anger, and his party finally finds someone to replace him.   \nAnd if he can do that, he will be able to harness to his party a lot more followers from the right side of the political map, and he might in the future have a bigger party and a better chance to be his own PM and not part of a such wide ideology coalition. Then, he can further his ideology. But he need a place to start, and this seems like his only shot right now.  \n  \nFor the left and central wing parties, this would also finally be an option for them to further social ideology, and gain points with the public that the left is not \"our enemy\" as the current PM is making them look. They can show that they support the people, support peace, and can make good on their words. That would also help them get votes in the future, as just being outside of the government all the time, doesn't help them one bit.  \n  \nAnd to the arab parties, finally being part of a coalition of government after so many years of being outside, and if they can get some things done, they will be viewed a lot better. And no one in the government will keep accusing them as the \"enemy\" as well.  \n  \nSo maybe it is a good thing. We will have to wait and see how things progress. They can very will backstab each other ever other tuesday, or they might actually work together trying to fix some issues.  \nIt is better than just continue the same destructive cycle of letting the current PM destroy the society in israel through fear and hate and keep letting things blow up every few years.",

He will be Prime Minister, not President. He can't do much without agreement of the Coalition. Which includes 13 seats for the 2 Left parties, 4 of the Arab party Ra'am, 17 of the Center-ish Yesh atid, and don't forget 7 of the staunch anti-theist Lieberman. \n\nAlso he won't even get a full term as Prime Minister.

This is mainly about everyone loathing Bibi and secular Israelis' dislike of the Haredi.  The gov't is probably not going to last that long but will enact legislation preventing Netanyahu from running and may make some reforms on that impact the Haredi - i.e. regulating the yeshivas and making the men serve in the military.
