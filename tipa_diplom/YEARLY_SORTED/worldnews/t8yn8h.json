From shooting on nuclear power plants to looking erratic even though he‚Äôs acting. He will shoot at civilians and create miss information to see if it‚Äôs even worse then it really is. Even if it is bad. He will use fear. He will use compassion and play on the heartstrings. He will do anything possible to make what he has been saying for 10 years come true. To make it seem as if the west attacking Russia. But the west will never attack Russia\n\nWe will not fire that shot. \n\nWe will wait him out. We will record his war crimes. We will find a way to show his people what he is doing. We will sanction and isolate him.

            "text": "Putin has been saying for 10 years that these missiles along his border are threat from NATO. That they would attack in one day. And look how he keeps his people in the dark? They don‚Äôt believe they are attacking Russians because that is attacking the brothers and sisters. It‚Äôs like even worse than America attack in Canada. If someone called you and told you that, would you believe it? The only way for him to continue his stupid crazy plan is to bake the west into firing a shot at Russia. Then his whole narrative works. He tells his people, who of course would believe it, that America attack them. And he must escalate to this that and whatever. And that we must go to war. And play out this fantasy of a new cold war and the new Cuban missile crisis he speaks about\n\n\nBecause I guarantee you that the isolated and uninformed Russian people who are told they were attack would say go nuclear. Even blow up the whole world - screw it. America will never live to attack Russia! In a hyperbolic way of putting it. The elder population would even believe it. They‚Äôve been lied to their whole life. \n\nLook how he has been saying for over 10 years like this video clip in five years. ‚ÄúI want mutually assured destruction‚Äù. It‚Äôs the only way to get back on average we lost.  Look how they even in the first week start mentioning nukes and World War III. And look how difficult a country like Korea with nukes is to deal with? Putin is willing to risk it all and even destroy the lives of his people for another 10 or 15 years if it helps get china and Russia some leverage back. And they‚Äôre playing the long game. They figure in the long run it‚Äôs worth it. Which I disagree with. But it‚Äôs not about Ukraine\n\nFor Putin it‚Äôs a long game with his people‚Äôs livelihood. As it‚Äôs always been with Soviet leaders. And he‚Äôs a Soviet minded kgb/fsb leader. \n\nIf you watch from nine minutes on he explains that the only way to address this whole list of grievances he goes over in the first nine minutes is to re-shift the balance of power. And we do that through mutually assured destruction. His concept is that mutually assured destruction  is a balancing vehicle. So it would get Russia back some leverage it last and push America and the waist down.\nHe is upset that we put our missiles around his border. We claimed they were in the name of the fence. This is why he did the exact same thing and it was his main strategy going into Ukraine. Declaring independent like we did in Kosovo. Moving your forces in the name of peacekeeping. And he was just cheeky about it. The next step is to beat America into a war so he can have this bullshit crazy stand us. And keep his people blind and only sitting on his narrative\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt have to be a secret to work. It just needs a participant. It needs the west to fire a shot so they can look like the victim\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo&t=115s  \n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cuban-missile-crisis-bring-russia-putin-190221190858809.html  \n\nNext thing he will do is make more threats and escalate. Do things like look crazy like shoot out a nuclear power plant. Pretend to look crazy and not him self (KGB tactic). And then start to influence the right wing in America wanting to go to war to help. I‚Äôm sure whoever has influence has already done this did you notice Trump did a 180 and suddenly called it a holocaust? Then the next day Lindsey Graham said we should shoot Putin. Who gave them those ideas? Who put those in their heads?\n\n\n\n\nAnd now this? \n\nSee \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/t7zznc/trump_jokes_us_should_put_the_chinese_flag_on_f22/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\n\n\nWe are trying to be manipulated into a war. It‚Äôs the only way Putin can do what he said he wanted to do. Without the nukes and somehow in his twisted mind getting back some leverage he thinks he lost\n\n\n\n\nMark my words the next couple of weeks you‚Äôre going to see Putin do anything to try to get the west to get involved. Either through fear or through making it look like a humanitarian crisis, some thing. But he‚Äôs going to want to use his Internet trolls to also get the sentiment in America to get them involved.\n\n\nBut that‚Äôs what he wants and we can‚Äôt do it. And it‚Äôs pretty messed up. I even have family there. Either Ukraine is the sacrificial lamb and we show Putin for who he is. Or, we get involved and trigger Cold War tensions and escalations to what we look like World War III. As tough as we are, it‚Äôs really hard to do anything when another country has the same nuclear arsenal you have. In fact more. And I don‚Äôt know how many new submarines he was bragging about\n\n\nIn 2019 I started to compile links. Not research. But things I was noticing as I watched Russia in the news. Putin had been preparing for a war. This has been long prepared. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the crappy tanks and bad maneuvers in Ukraine. It‚Äôs all for bait. They want to appear weak so that the west can come in. They want to threaten and make Putin seem crazy. They attack nuclear plants and cars humanitarian crisis. I‚Äôll because Putin wants to be in a world war. Or make it begin the process of wine. Also he can get a new security deal. He said so himself\n\nYou will see. He‚Äôs going to do things that don‚Äôt make sense because his intention is to escalate. He already said it. Give me a deal or war. Today to macron. \n\nZelensky should tell the world and call\nHim on it \n\nBut it‚Äôs why the west can‚Äôt join. This will play into the lie that Putin thinks he can control and manipulate. He believes he can, like a megalomaniac, control every aspect of this including information and miss information to get what he wants. For the west to fire in Russia. And then to escalate and provoke world tensions beyond anything we‚Äôve seen. Because it won‚Äôt even be like the Cold War or World War II. Everything is different with new technology. And he thinks he has new toys he can show off and threaten the world with. All if we fire a shot first. Why not just a technical directly? Because he knows his people would not buy that narrative. He is trying to create a very deceptive narrative and bait the west \n\n\nPeople have asked. So we let him just go from this country to the next? Good luck to him. Wait him out. Make him and his country feel the pressure. Let him go bankrupt. And good luck going to another country and then another. Good luck plugging up all the holes of information so your people don‚Äôt know. Good luck keeping up the morale.\n\nYou do not go to war with a nuclear power. Especially when he says that is exactly what he wants. Because he has this fantasy that he can regain leverage. Don‚Äôt take the bait. We will not fire shots in Russia. We will let the world intervene. We will let capitalism speak. We will let the United Nations get involved. We will wait for China to say something. But we will not fire shots and Russia and make everything Putin has been saying come true for his people - Who are being manipulated and controlled",
