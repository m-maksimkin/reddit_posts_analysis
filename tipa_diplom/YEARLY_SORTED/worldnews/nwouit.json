They got that right.\" \n\nEverything is so over the top from college football with military jet flyovers to megalomaniac politicians. Christianity is so entrenched in politics and many other aspects it has no business being a part of. Wall St. is a joke - rigged system for the rich pigs to print money and roll around in their filth. Big money has infected nearly every facet of American society imaginable through \"lobbying\" practices (i.e. legal bribes) that should never have been allowed. Private prisons that are basically modern plantations, for profit healthcare, people endentured to jobs they hate because they provide basic healthcare that is offered \"free\" in many other countries. This is to say nothing of all the guns that have been purchased (and used to kill) in the name of the second amendment because of the NRA lobbying. And don't even get me started on the military industrial complex...\n\n\nAnd then look at the political landscape. One party that doesn't even try to hide its evil anymore. Just a bunch of the most straight up fascist, racist, xenophobic, hatred-spewing, obstructionist, seditious, corrupt, bile-spewing, right-wing extremist, conspiracy theory-slinging, vote-suppressing, cheating, lying villain-faced dick pimples to ever walk the earth.\n\n\nThe other party sort of appears to stand for the correct side of the argument in most areas and yet still tries to play ball with the afformentioned dick pimples when it comes to making some real progress. It's clear as day that big money runs the show for these \"good guys\" as well.\n\n\nEvery 4 years, it's a crapshoot whether we're going to have a level-headed and coherent president at the helm or whether every ounce of progress made will be undone and trounced on by some dick-swinging right wing nut Job. Global agreements can be torn up (and have been) on an impulse. Allies are left to suffer or go at it alone because \"fuck you, I got mine\" is the mantra of the current POTUS.\n\nAnd now, it seems that democracy itself is no longer a foregone conclusion in the U.S. One party is working around the clock to make sure the next kick at the seditious can is successful and fascism can be permanently installed so that the evil left wing can never hurt another unborn baby or cause riots in the streets /s.\n\nAs an outsider (Canadian), I know my country isn't perfect or without flaws. But I see the U.S. as a massively unfunny joke. I have lots of post COVID travel plans and America isn't on any of them.\n\n\nI saw an analyst prediction during the last election that the U.S. would lose its position as top dog on the world stage in the next decade. With the size of the U.S. military and all the foreign aid it gives out, I'm not sure about that. But the whole place needs a massive remodeling at a minimum.",

It uses a first past the post two party system, an electoral college that focuses elections on a few key states and makes it so the winner of an election can very well get fewer votes. It allows for blatant gerrymandering, excessive lobbying and regulatory capture by interest groups, massive voter disenfranchisement, particularly of people of minorities, allows states to make it harder for those that the current holders of power would like to disenfranchise to vote, by removing polling stations, having the vote take place on a work day, remove and constrain options for early and mail voting, and the whole process is so convoluted and far removed from the common man, and choices so constrained by the two party system, that the public has almost completely lost faith in the process.\n\nAnd even outside of elections, the options for bad faith tactics and filibustering, of padding bills to include totally unrelated riders, and all sorts of nonsense, have ground actual progress to a standstill.\n\nAnd to top it off, the system seems categorically incapable of holding elected officials to account for repeated blatant falsehoods, gross incompetence and negligence and massive corruption, fraud and collusion with enemy states.\n\nI mean, what person that pays even the bare minimum of attention thinks this is something to emulate?\n\nSure, if you're living in a dictatorship, it's a step up.

My observations:\n\nElections here are just very expensive fights for power between two corporate entities: the DNC and the RNC. Neither entity gives a hoot about the interests of the average American person. All they care about is obtaining and hanging onto power at all costs.\n\nThe corporate media here is basically just a megaphone for either the RNC or the DNC. They cannot be trusted to give you any information that would provoke critical thought. It's just confirmation bias for the coddled cable TV viewer.\n\nSubnational governments here are either anemic and underfunded (e.g. Florida) or overfunded and bloated (e.g. California). Neither is effective. Working for the government (i.e. public service) is considered low-status. Many services that governments are supposed to provide, but don't, is delivered by non-profits or, worse, the for-profit private sector.\n\nElections are intentionally yet unnecessarily complex. Some states don't even require ID to vote (e.g. California). Whether this is considered effective democracy depends on which party you support. Nobody will acknowledge that every other democracy in the world requires voter registration/ID. \n\nThere is no incentive to have a simplified, auditable voting system as that would eliminate the opportunity to cry foul when your party loses.\n\nJust my observations.",

Being American is a lot like being a Bulls fan: You still wear the logo and chant the chants, but inside you know that the last “great” thing the organization did was before a lot Chicagoans were born.\n\nSo it is with America. A couple of days ago was the anniversary of D-day. *That* was a great thing. America was truly great. But these days? We’re just a conglomerate of despicable and pathetic policy that incentivizes our citizens to get absolutely raped by .gov. There’s just nothing left to be proud of anymore. Wall St. is fucking us. Law enforcement is fucking us. Gov is fucking us. The private sector is fucking us. And why not? Fucking U.S. citizens is business and business is a *boomin!*\n\nBrailsford got a 35 *thousand dollar* reward for torturing and murdering Shaver. Robinhood was rewarded with a shitzillion dollars for fixing the market against investors. Apple/Google/Amazon pay zero taxes and pass the bill on to citizens.\n\nHow’s that for a little sample size? That’s 1. Murder 2. Criminal fraud 3. Tax evasion and it was all enthusiastically supported by our government. So at this point it’s open season on us as far as I’m concerned. I’m terrified of the police, I’m terrified if investing, and I’m terrified of poverty. Does that sound like “the land of the free and the home of the brave” to you? Mind you, this is *peacetime.* Normally those aforementioned fears of violence, fraud, and poverty are reserved for wartime.\n\nNobody is here to save us. On one side of the aisle we’ve got dipshit cronies like Jeff Sessions locking us up for *life* because he thinks pot is the same thing as black tar heroin. We’ve got phony Presidents claiming that the election was “stolen,” conveniently without any evidence to support the claim.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle we’ve got full on anti semitic and pro racist representatives like Ilhan Omar. That’s a real bad sign when the representatives of the “multicultural melting pot” are anti multiculturalism. Then we’ve got delusional (possibly retarded) representatives like AOC who are literally too stupid to understand the basic structure of the fed, or how unemployment is calculated.\n\nWhat a shameful, embarrassing, and horrific place to live.

In the past politicians were just as much in the pocket of industry interests. What lobbyists do is nothing new, we just have a name for it now and there is generally an open paper trail. In the past the same kind of industry lobbied laws would get pushed, but it was far more in the backroom and hidden behind various euphemism for morality or nationalism. Likewise the issues of voter suppression and disenfranchisement, or media and protestor right violations, or systemic racism... these things have been around even when the US was regarded as the pinnacle of the democratic systems. It wasn't just invented, its been around, and the lights are being shined on it now.  \n\n\nThe biggest failure, that gap between intent in our model of democracy and how we put things into practice... It was generally believed there would be more constitutional reforms more often.   \n\n\nSome of my favorite additions I think we'd benefit from... A number of countries have a branch of government separate of executive, legislative, and judiciary that are specifically tasked with investigating and prosecuting government corruption. Or the notion of a higher court to preemptively review legal constitutionality that is separate from the higher court that reviews cases where there is believed to be a violation of rights.",

Going through American politics you see all kinds of shit from the 3/5ths compromise to trying to keep the number of slave and non-slave states equal to the prohibition time period where virtually all politicians were corrupt. Then you have voter suppression and Jerrymandering to \"campaign funds aka bribery\" to all sorts of bullshit.\n\nI'm not saying America was never a good democracy, I'm really just saying that all governments are susceptible to corruption and have their inadequacies in governance.\n\nAfter WW2, America sold itself as the shining example of democracy and a crusade against communism when in reality it has always been average. Now that the cold War is over and there is no \"great enemy\" to blame our problems on, our weaknesses are more apparent. Every country, democracy or not, is full of historical corruption or rulebending politicians or backwards policy; to pretend otherwise is being ignorant.

The current round of Voter Suppression laws demonstrate how this works.  The process is simple; identify demographics that support your party and those that support the other party and then find perfectly legal adjustments to the election process and rules that make it easier for “your” demographic to vote and harder for the other demographic to vote.  An example of this would be if The Party in Power discovered that supporters of the other party were more likely to move, they would “ step up” the process of purging voters who had reported a post office change of address but if they found that their voters were more likely to move, relaxing the process of purging.  This sort of thing has gone on all along and a lot of insiders don’t see a problem with it.

They don't care if the people they vote for will actually do good for their or their family & friends lives or harm them, they just want their side to win. They don't care if they support anti immigration or racism, they just want their side to win. \n\nThe far right rioting in the capital would gladly join the nazi party if they were german citizens back in the day & thought Jews were the great evil needing to be purged from existence. The far left & all the young people burning and destroying businesses during the racial injustice protest would gladly let the holocaust happen if it meant they benefited from it, got to enjoy stealing wealth from the undesirables of society & be seen as higher class thanks to it.\n\nAnd then there are the normal conservatives who see the downsides of progressive's beliefs for America's future but won't go around religiously following one person or go try to murder the other parties leaders. This isn't 1921 where its okay for any patriot to go around assassinating anyone with progressive views they don't like & still be accepted by society at large, they realize that. \n\nAnd the normal democrats, who hate the way the world was, hate that it isn't how they wish it was in the future & will protest for that, but not take out their anger on small businesses, property, innocent people that have nothing to do with their anger.

And no we don’t need more politicians.  We need less and less think tanks and less computer modeling just screwing us over and over.  My own brother in law uses me for a mat to jump up and down on, my back is screwed and every time I say I am in pain everyone says I am fine.  How can I escape this shadow, I can’t, and when I’m done working I will more than likely die the same week.  Thanks for making management and contractors so management can treat people worse than dogs.  This year, they have been nice to a few of us, the ones who are so smart if they got rid of us they would end up in serious pain.  Or would have to do some work themselves.  I’m sick of every Congress person present and past.  Some in the current administration are killers and won’t admit it. Some in the past are as well.  They are the ones with Barney Frank allowed Oxy a schedule 2 drug to be in every house in America by saying all the Oxy makers could Self-Regulate while they tied the hands of the DEA saying they could not prosecute.  And it was the asshole Evangelical team that wanted to disappear for good.  Putting that idiot from Phoenix House in charge of writing a pain pill equivalency chart and calling it Gospel.  They caused suicides, they jailed pain doctors, they caused strokes and heart attacks in the elder community by pulling their pain meds.  People in pain end up with high blood pressure and can die, same with people prone to strokes.  There was no gentle weaning, there were immediate cut offs sanctioned by the FDA, DEA so on and so forth.  They harassed doctors, took their licenses, bullied.  My own doctor got a letter from Medicare that said if these people are not under the state maximum we will take all of them out of the practice.  Nice harassment.  Then a bunch of those old people died Nationwide.  No skin off the people in Congress, made the Evangelicals happy because they believe no one should have pain meds, we have sinned and that has caused our pain we deserve it.  Frankly every last person in Congress (minus the noobies) should be taught what pain really is.  And guess why they really did it (why they blame or use their religion as a weapon).  Every and I mean Every insurance company (Medicare had record savings) had record profits that year.  Wonders where that filthy money trail leads back to, oh would it be Congress?  I use Oxy myself and can barely move because of my non treatable back pain.  Oh no I couldn’t possibly need any more because I stopped sinning.

The number of democracies in the world rose; the spread of liberal-democratic governance began to appear inevitable. But this was no more than a reverie. Infant democracies grew, toddled, wobbled, and fell: Hungary, Albania, Poland, Lithuania, Yugoslavia. In older states, too, the desperate masses turned to authoritarianism. Benito Mussolini marched on Rome in 1922. It had taken a century and a half for European monarchs who ruled by divine right and brute force to be replaced by constitutional democracies and the rule of law. Now Fascism and Communism toppled these governments in a matter of months, even before the stock-market crash of 1929 and the misery that ensued.\n\n“Epitaphs for democracy are the fashion of the day,” the soon-to-be Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote, dismally, in 1930.\n\nAnywho-you get the point? :)",

We still have voting, and even with the corruption, if everyone complaining about the system actually voted 3rd party instead of giving in, we could start to move past this. And a lot of the non voting community are people who want a 3rd party but think there is no hope. It doesn’t take a win to change things. If non mainstream politicians get an insane amount of votes over and over it will start to curve people in the middle. This is almost the same theory of better of two evils, but I say vote foe the third party even if you don’t completely believe in them to disrupt the system in place. We do not want to fight against the entire system, it’s inherently a pretty damn good one. The people just need to decide that it’s okay to lose as long as we are moving votes over to 3rd party people at a rate that will inevitably convince others to do the same until we break free of the two party system. Anarchy and not voting only results in the government gaining more power by your non involvement. At best you tear down society and the most pompous asshole takes over from there. Structure is important and we still have a chance to reverse things.
