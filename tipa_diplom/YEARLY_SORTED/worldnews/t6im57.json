They are not likely to take a firm stance and impose sanctions no matter what, for different reasons. NK are the only one of the three firmly in support of Russia but that's meaningless. They are basically against anything the west is in favour of on principle.\n\nKazakhstan and Azerbaijan, fairly, both try to maintain good relations with both Russia and the EU, to varying degrees. Neither have recognised the Donbas separatist states. Neither have assisted militarily, Azerbaijan has assisted Ukraine with humanitarian aid. Neither have gone further, or are likely to, and fair enough.\n\nBelarus is obviously siding with Russia given its actions.\n\nGeorgia is quite obviously \"fuck off Putin\" given the occupation of South Ossetia .\n\nUkraine is the one getting its cities shelled.\n\nI can only imagine it's the EU he's really talking to, but they're taking a position that was entirely predictable.\n\nWho on earth is he pleading with?",

At face value his statements seem to indicate he  thinks he can get back to normal/ wants to restore his deceptive prudent style.

But if this is another fucking mindgame of his to get the West to relent so that he can pursue the war, I think he's mistaken. The coalition is way too big, there were way too much sanctions.

But does it really matter if a nuke is fired at Russia from 500 miles away instead of 1500 miles away? Either way the shit has hit the fan with insufficient time to duck.\n\nPutin fears a stable democracy on Russia's doorstep. A democracy where an incumbent president loses an election and peacefully hands over power to the winner, and in the next election the winner loses to the previous president and peacefully hands power back to the former president (or a newcomer) in a free and fair eletion.\n\n*That* is why Putin fears/hates Ukraine. Russians will wonder, if they can do it, why can't we? That would destabilize Putin's power as a dictator. Remember what happened to Italian dictator Mussolini? To Libya's Gaddafi? Iraq's Hussein? That is Putin's real fear; loss of dictatorial control of the Russian people.",

If Russia  doesn't take over Ukraine now, they're probably going to lose Crimea in the long run, along with paying out reparations.   I think Putin's gonna go all in, if this war doesn't go his way he might bring out whatever nukes he is still in control of.    Putin's mindset to governance is through brute force, and is lacking in nuance or savvy.   If he approached government with the mindset of \"It's not about getting what I want, it's about getting others to want what I want\" the world stage would look VERY different.\n\nThe destruction of An-225 was a huge PR loss for both Ukraine and Russia.   If I was in Putin's shoes, I would blame Ukraine for the destruction of this plane and say that they did it to deny Russia the ability to control/use this singular resource and then turned around and blamed Russian forces to try and \"control the narrative\".   Zelynsky has already controlled this story, Putin is now a few points behind.    If Putin released photos of himself on the frontlines in combat gear or work clothes, he would have a much different perception by the world instead of the pictures of him in an office suit and tie.    Putin's tying himself to the \"government bureaucrat\" image, probably unintentionally.   Contrast that with Zelynsky's pics/vids in camos/combat gear.

As a result, the Finns sarcastically dubbed the Soviet cluster bombs \"Molotov bread baskets\" in reference to Molotov's propaganda broadcasts. When the hand-held bottle firebomb was developed to attack and destroy Soviet tanks, the Finns called it the \"Molotov cocktail\", as \"a drink to go with his food parcels\".\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molotov_cocktail#Etymology",

While the rest of the nation failed to understand that we no longer are equal, and it is dog eat dog now.. so please don’t be racist towards all Russians, most of us believe to be very kind, and strongly believe in equality.. its the ones with money you have to watch out for, who have dolphins delivered to their Villas in the alps so their spoiled kids can play with them.. #truestory",
