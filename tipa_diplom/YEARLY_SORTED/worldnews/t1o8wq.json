This situation is serious.\n\nI cannot believe who I speak to in the UK when they simply say \"It must be so awful for those poor people\" and in the next breath happy to stand by as the Ukraine falls. And it will. I find it so utterly disgusting and despicable. \n\nI am nobody, but I condemn Germany's actions through this, I condemn this total bullshit about German artillery being used - then why did you just export 10 Bn Euros worth of it to Egypt alone? What do they think it's going on someone's mantlepiece? Fucking COWARDS!\n\nThe EU has totally lost any positive thoughts I have had. They are standing by and watching a nation being torn down and being Russia's little bitches. These sanctions are bullshit, these leaders are bullshit, these summits are bullshit. I am nowhere near Ukrainian in Nationality but I am so very disappointed with the actions of Western Europe. \n\nHelmets? A ride out? Are they fucking kidding me? \n\nIn a year's time when Putin has made his next steps - which he will given we have demonstrated that we will stand by, limp dicks in hand - we will regret not supplying Zelensky with all he needs.\n\nAnd really, the UK is out of the EU now. It does not need Merkel's fucking blessing. I would sing every praise of Boris right now if he stepped up and supplied artillery, troops and whatever else.

I'm anti war because only the rich and powerful benefit, all us lower and mid class people always get screwed. If you can say \"be careful of propaganda\" to the \"enemy\" population, you should be able to say the same to yourself and your own people.\n\nGranted, I will admit that what I wrote can be seen as cold towards the Ukrainian people, and for that I apologize, because I support Ukrainians in their defense, because Ukraine is being used as a tool for NATO and Russia. \n\nNATO and Russia have been playing \"I'm not touching you!\" for over years, decades. But like in real life, whoever hits first is usually seen as wrong, in this case Russia obviously. \n\nSo to all the haters responding, just be careful that this doesn't convince you that Russia and its people are the enemy, only the powers that be, which is why I'm glad the major international response has been to hit the rich and powerful with sanctions and financial isolation. It is unfortunate that the lower classes will also suffer because of this, but it is better than killing more soldiers and citizens. \n\nA nuanced understanding doesn't equal sucking Putin's dick lol. Don't let your support of Ukraines defense turn into support of becoming the invading \"peacekeepers\". Here in the US we know all about meddling in other places, and have constantly been duped into believing we are going place to \"save\" or \"liberate\", and you have to be self aware enough to know that the only reason the US doesn't get as much flak is because of its strength, but lack of flak doesn't mean we are doing the right thing. The US is incredibly hypocritical, and so is NATO, and so is Russia. Just doing get blinded because you happen to be on the side of the \"peace keepers\", and this is true for Russian and American citizens.\n\nGo Ukraine!  Push them back!",

Some of these reasons were and still are heartbreaking.  I wanted to give all of them A's but as a teacher I also wanted to push them academically.\n\nTo the ones that had legitimately difficult lives, i used to pull them aside and give them major considerations for late work, repeated exam attempts, and I would tell them, \"it is not the hardships or what we were forced to go through that determine who we are but it is how we respond and what our actions are in those difficulties that defines our characters.\"\n\nI would tell them that we've had some great examples of true heroes  in our history, but I think Zelensky is a living example of one of these heroes. Looking at his actions now I cannot even begin to  imagine how great of a brother/father/son/friend/mentor/husband Zelensky is.  I hope and pray that he and the people of Ukraine make it though this invasion and that Ukraine is lucky enough to have this truly great leader lead them for decades to come.\n\nThe actions of the brave 13, Zelensky, and the people of Ukraine will forever make me respect all people of Ukrainian decent.  My grandmother walked for days from North Korea to the south during the Korean war carrying a newborn, carrying her possessions in her back, making my 5 year old mom and her 4 year old brother walk, holding her hand.  A village church elder put my mom's 3 tear old brother on his back, and walked with them for days to the south Korean border, and then he returned to, \"keep the Church doors open and help those that cannot evacuate the village\" despite my Grandmother begging him to come with them to the south.  He was publicly executed in the town by the communists when he returned to his home town for aiding an a wife of an enemy of the state.  My grandmother found out what happened to him when she found the man's daughter in a refugee area in Pusan.\n\nI think about all of these people who lived hard and made hard decisions that cost them their lives and think of how if that town elder did not do what was right and help my grandmother (whose husband, my grandfather defied the communists and got stuck on an US Army base and was forcibly evacuated with them), that my mother may not have made it and that I would not have spent a decade making impact in the lives of students. I have tremendous respect for Koreans when I think back to those few that I know of... \n\nI hope that the actions of all of these Ukrainian heroes become a catalyst to let the world know and respect how great of human beings the Ukrainians are and i hope it will instill pride in the future Ukrainians to be even greater than the great people that they are now.\n\nI am hoping that the Zelensky's posting of social media in the world will make it harder for some army to just 'erase him' without thinking of the possible repercussions in the world/internet.  It's easy to ban history books, but not easy to delete/ban social media posts from heroes.  I hope citizens of Ukraine continue to post their struggles to the internet for the world to see.",

And it seems to me, his interest, and also Klitschkos (who is worth a couple millions, he could be anywhere he wants in this world) - became politics to truly help their country and they do care about the people. They do not flee, they are VERY ready to fight!   \n... This is the actual JOB, he is doing his job the way everyone should be.   \nI hope one day on this planet earth, there will come a time, where the ones who aren't greedy and careless, narcissistic and disgusting will be the leaders of this world.  \nI have seen an actual switch in society.... back when I was a teenager, I mean, thats 20 years ago, so not THAT long, yet people have changed and I feel like people do care more about each other, of course the internet and the general globalization is what made this happen. But it also made the mighty and powerful even more ... of what they already are. Extremely powerful  \nAs long as the dictatorian countries keep stacking up their military and all they have in mind is POWER; ... this won't be a place for HUMAN BEINGS to live (a good life). Most of us 7 billion folks on this planet want to live free, happy and without war. The fact that nukes came into play makes us every day Joes helpless and angry. It's unfortunate that the world isn't a peaceful place when everything we have, nature, animals, love, speech, families, all the beautiful things isn't enough.  \nSo the every day Joe at some point became greedy, this could be you and me. Every one who smelled security and wealth doesn't want to give up on it, meh, maybe some, maybe some people who want to chill on an island because they've had enough and can see through the fake bs we're stuck in.   \nEvery wealthy person is wealthy because 100000 other people or even 100000's are poor, very poor!   \nAnd when I say wealth, I am speaking about having a place to live and clean water.

Some of these reasons were and still are heartbreaking.  I wanted to give all of them A's but as a teacher I also wanted to push them academically.\n\nTo the ones that had legitimately difficult lives, i used to pull them aside and give them major considerations for late work, repeated exam attempts, and I would tell them, \"it is not the hardships or what we were forced to go through that determine who we are but it is how we respond and what our actions are in those difficulties that defines our characters.\"\n\nI would tell them that we've had some great examples of true heroes  in our history, but I think Zelensky is a living example of one of these heroes. Looking at his actions now I cannot even begin to  imagine how great of a brother/father/son/friend/mentor/husband Zelensky is.  I hope and pray that he and the people of Ukraine make it though this invasion and that Ukraine is lucky enough to have this truly great leader lead them for decades to come.\n\nThe actions of the brave 13, Zelensky, and the people of Ukraine will forever make me respect all people of Ukrainian decent.  My grandmother walked for days from North Korea to the south during the Korean war carrying a newborn, carrying her possessions in her back, making my 5 year old mom and her 4 year old brother walk, holding her hand.  A village church elder put my mom's 3 tear old brother on his back, and walked with them for days to the south Korean border, and then he returned to, \"keep the Church doors open and help those that cannot evacuate the village\" despite my Grandmother begging him to come with them to the south.  He was publicly executed in the town by the communists when he returned to his home town for aiding an a wife of an enemy of the state.  My grandmother found out what happened to him when she found the man's daughter in a refugee area in Pusan.\n\nI think about all of these people who lived hard and made hard decisions that cost them their lives and think of how if that town elder did not do what was right and help my grandmother (whose husband, my grandfather defied the communists and got stuck on an US Army base and was forcibly evacuated with them), that my mother may not have made it and that I would not have spent a decade making impact in the lives of students. I have tremendous respect for Koreans when I think back to those few that I know of... \n\nI hope that the actions of all of these Ukrainian heroes become a catalyst to let the world know and respect how great of human beings the Ukrainians are and i hope it will instill pride in the future Ukrainians to be even greater than the great people that they are now.\n\nI am hoping that the Zelensky's posting of social media in the world will make it harder for some army to just 'erase him' without thinking of the possible repercussions in the world/internet.  It's easy to ban history books, but not easy to delete/ban social media posts from heroes.  I hope citizens of Ukraine continue to post their struggles to the internet for the world to see.",

Russia may and probably will win in the end, but I have to imagine Putin thought it was going to be easier.\n\nCould anyone really imagine Trump doing the same here? That low-life would be on the first flight out of the country, and would throw his own kids off the plane to make room for himself.",
