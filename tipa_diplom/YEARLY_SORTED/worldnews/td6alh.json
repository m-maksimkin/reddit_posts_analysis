But Im reminded of all the American news outlets all broadcasting live from the nation their home country is about to invade chillin out in the Iraqi capital and reporting on US tomahawk missiles cruising down the streets. It strikes me as extremely weird.  Like they were all there for some spectacle. And in the case of desert storm, wouldn't that kinda possibly make you a target as well, being an American on hostile territory?  Then, in addition, how should the state react?  Should it be treated like another nation is intentionally targeting their civilians, despite being in an open warzone?  Either way, its definitely brave to willingly go out there.

They had been reporting from Ukraine and the Donbass conflict for two years. The day before they bought a car so they could be more mobile and quickly escape danger and move around the different frontlines and retreat if need be. While driving outside Okhtyrka on the 26th of February their car was shot at. One guy took three bullets to the leg and lower back and the other took a bullet in the shoulder and collarbone. They were wearing bulletproof vests. Their car was also pretty fucked but continued to drive for a while so they got away.\n\nUkrainians got them to hospital in Okhtyrka where they had surgery and then taken to Poltava away from the front. That hospital however was also repeatedly shelled. The two journalists continued to report and film and showed how doctors and patients were forced to seek shelter in the hospitals basement during shelling and missile attacks. Not ideal for those in critical condition or needing urgent surgery upstairs.\n\nThe two were eventually evacuated and have now had more surgery in Denmark and are okay. But shit - they really showcased the realities not only for Ukrainian troops but also civilians in the first days of the war. They did not look like soldiers but were driving a civilian car clearly marked as PRESS. And those patients in Poltava sure as hell didn't deserve to die in a dark basement just a few meters below the hospital facilities that would have saved their lives.\n\nHere's an article in English about them. All their own reporting is sadly in Danish: [https://rsf.org/en/news/ukraine-two-injured-danish-journalists-have-been-evacuated](https://rsf.org/en/news/ukraine-two-injured-danish-journalists-have-been-evacuated)\n\nEdit: corrected the date.
