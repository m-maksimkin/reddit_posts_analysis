Schedule for it three days ahead or don't go out at all and order off of amazon. Doctors checkup? Schedule for it several weeks ahead, only to have the dr cancel at last notice without a single call or alert come through. We have only mobile phone services out here, and that's spotty at best.

Additionally the period of time the vaccine is durable is only 2-5 months according to a number of studies, with a big dip in effectiveness past 5 months out to a a year at which point they believe it may have very little effectiveness.  We need more data and studies.  But sadly doing shit like this is just going to kill people, and the vaccine does not stop infection it just mitigates symptoms to the vaccinated.  It may in fact be speading the virus faster, and is in fact mutating the virus faster. Fortunately with each mutation it appears to be getting less lethal yet more infectious.  My uncle died from COVID, he was vaccinated.  This vaccine is shit.  And it carries a good deal of risk of clots and heart inflammation in younger folks.",

What they're doing now is revoking that free COVID treatment for those unvaccinated.\n\nI know that's exactly what the news article says but wanted to bring some context in case someone thinks this is a Health Care system like the Spanish one, where every treatment is free and people pay a lot of taxes.\n\nEDIT: thanks a lot for the awards! Since some people complained I basically rephrased what could have been said with 10 words, I wanted to expand on the context I tried to introduce here.  \n\n\nIn Singapore, every worker is forced to put money on a fund called CPF ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central\\_Provident\\_Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Provident_Fund)). You're supposed to pay healthcare from that fund but that doesn't mean healthcare is free. However, COVID treatment was free. They wouldn't deduct money from your CPF. Until now.

            "text": "Pretty much how it works in Australia with respect to Early Childcare, but with a few more caveats. \n\nIf your child isn't vaccinated, they are not eligible for some Family Tax Benefits, which offsets the cost of childcare which can be in excess of AUD$100 per day.\n\nThere are other tax benefits, such as low income, etc which is subsidised by the government. Not sure how it works with unvaccinated kids, I'm not in that industry. \n\nI also have no idea how it works if the unvaccinated child is unvaccinated due to being immunocompromised. \n\nSo they have to pay full cost, all out of pocket. \n\nIf another child in their child's room is sick, the unvaccinated child is to be taken home by their parents / guardian ASAP, and is not allowed to return until the all clear is given. \n\nNote the parents of the unvaccinated child is still paying full fee for each allocated day their child is absent, in order to keep their spot. \n\nSo basically, you're allowed to not vaccinate your child - it can just be very expensive. \n\nAnd this is Australia - we have Medicare / Universal Healthcare. \n\nWe also have social security payments if you're unemployed.  \n\nLow income earners get a card that works essentially like a senior's card, half price public transport, etc. \n\nIt's also perfect for University students - you get social security payments while studying.  It's not a lot, but you can get by, and supplement your income up to a threshold before your social security starts to taper off. Full-time Students also get a pretty good deal - half price public transport, restaurants give discounts, etc. \n\nWe also have what is called a HELP loan - for University or other approved higher education provider (Like community college / TAFE).  It pays your course fees upfront, and you only pay it back over time once you're earning over a certain threshold. It works as a deduction, kinda like tax. It is also *interest free*, and only increases with inflation.  So even studying is free (for a while, I guess).\n\nIt's not perfect, but it's better than what I read and hear about in the US. \n\nSorry for the off tangent rant, but I don't know why such a large economy like the US doesn't have something similar. \n\nWe do pay more tax in general, I guess... But as you can see... We get it back in benefits to the economy. \n\nI'm lucky to be born here, at this time in history.",
