In a time of war where there are two sides, one should have restraint when digesting news articles as these articles are 1. Often bias  2. Simply carry out misinformation. The UK has made their stance clear on the matter and readily accepting UK, US and EU new sources comes with a narrowed observational viewpoint and a tainted lens when viewing the events within the rest of the world\n\nThis is no different than the blindly accepting Russian Meida and it's take on the Ukraine conflict, yet everyone on this sub calls those of differing opinions brain washed and crazy (most likely due to your inability to comprehend and respond to any opposition, just like the very dictators you call out)\n\nThat being said I am not stopping you from supporting the side and which news articles you believe, I think all of us want an end to the war. To which I personally believe President Zelensky should have some concessions to end violence within Ukraine because clearly Russia is not stopping and they WILL NOT lose this war, even it means bringing out their most advanced weaponry to fight, unless the necessary concessions are made.",

Journalist like to make money, so we can assume that there's a small chance it's made up to sell an article. \n\nWhat we do know is that during a war, journalism is tailored by the country you live in to favour your ideal view, couple with the fact this could be complete fabrication from the journalist. So in saying that, we could say that this is less than a 50% chance that this article is even remotely true.\n\nAm I wrong?",

Buckle up for a long thread and definitely please share far & wide. The full text is over 2000 words. This is a highly insightful look behind the curtain - covers many subjects.\n> \n> I will add clarification comments inside parenthesis where necessary. So, let's roll: \n> \n> \"I have hardly slept at all these days, at work at almost all times, I have brain-fog. Maybe from overworking, but I feel like I am in a surreal world.\n> \n> The Pandora‚Äôs Box is open ‚Äì a real global horror will begin by the summer ‚Äì global famine is inevitable as Russia and Ukraine are main producers of wheat. (MY COMMENTARY: I disagree that this will result in global famine.)\n> \n> **I can‚Äôt say what guided those in charge to decide to proceed with the execution of this operation (Ukraine invasion), but now they are methodically blaming us (FSB). We are being scolded for our analysis. Recently, we have been increasingly pressured to prepare more reports.**\n> \n> All of these political consultants and politicians and the powers-that-be are causing chaos. Most importantly, no one knew that there will be such a war ‚Äì it was concealed from everyone.\n> \n> For example ‚Äì you are being asked to analyze various outcomes and consequences of a meteorite attack on Russia (MY COMMENTARY: Here he most likely means the West‚Äôs sanctions) ‚Äì\n> \n> **So you research the mode of attack, and you are being told that it‚Äôs just a hypothetical and not to stress on the details, so you understand the report is only intended as a checkbox for some bureaucrat, and the conclusions of the analysis must be positive for Russia, otherwise you basically get interrogated for not doing good work.** So, you have to write that we have all necessary measures available to nullify the effects of a given type of attack. We are completely overworked.\n> \n> But then it turns out that the hypothetical has turned into reality, and the analysis we‚Äôve done on that hypothetical is total trash. We have no answer to the sanctions because of this. No one knew there‚Äôd be such a war, so no one prepared for these sanctions.\n> \n> It‚Äôs the flipside consequence of the secrecy ‚Äì since everyone was kept in the dark, how could we prepare for it?\n> \n> Kadyrov has gone nuts. We (FSB) were very close to a conflict with him because the Ukrainians claimed to having received intel from the FSB on his squad in Kyiv.\n> \n> Kadyrov's squad was absolutely demolished before they even had a chance to fight and they got blown to pieces. I do not have any info that it was an FSB leak to Ukraine, so I‚Äôd give it a 1-2% chance ‚Äì but can‚Äôt exclude this possibility completely.\n> \n> Our Blitzkrieg has totally collapsed. It is impossible to complete the task: If Zelensky and his deputies were captured in the first 3 days, all key buildings also captured, and they were forced to read an address of their surrender to the country,\n> \n> then Ukraine‚Äôs resistance would have likely dissolved to a minimal level. Theoretically. But then what? Even in this IDEAL outcome, there remained an unsolvable problem: Who is the counterparty to our negotiations?\n> \n> If we remove Zelensky ‚Äì fine ‚Äì who is going to sign the agreement? If Zelensky signs, then that agreement is worthless after we remove him. –û–ü–ó–ñ (The Opposition Party in Ukraine collaborating with Russia) has refused to cooperate.\n> Medvechuk, the coward, ran away. There is another leader ‚Äì Boyko, but he refused too, even his own people won‚Äôt understand him. Wanted to bring back Tsaryova, but even our guys are against him here in Russia. Bring back Yanukovich? But how?\n> \n> If we are saying we can‚Äôt occupy, then the newly formed government will be overthrown in 10 minutes as soon as we leave.\n> \n> To occupy? Where would we find that many people? Commandant‚Äôs office, military police, counter-intelligence, security ‚Äì even at minimum resistance from the Ukrainians, we‚Äôd need over 500,000 people, not including supply & logistics.\n> \n> There‚Äôs a rule - if you try to cover for bad quality leadership with quantity, you‚Äôll make everything worse. And I repeat this would be the problem in the IDEAL SCENARIO, which does not exist.\n> \n> And what now? We cannot announce general mobilization for two reasons: \n> 1) Mobilization will implode the situation inside Russia: political, economic, and social.\n> \n> 2) Our logistics are already over-extended today. We can send a much large contingent into Ukraine, and what would we get? Ukraine ‚Äì a territorially enormous country, and their hate towards us is astronomical.\n> Our roads simply cannot accommodate the resupply of such convoys, and everything will come to a halt. And we can‚Äôt pull it off from the management side because of the current chaos.\n> \n> These two reasons exist concurrently, although just one of them is enough to break everything.\n> \n> With regards to Russian military losses: I don‚Äôt know the reality ‚Äì no one does. There was some information the first 2 days, but now no one knows what is happening in Ukraine. We‚Äôve lost contact with major divisions. (!!)\n> \n> They may re-establish contact, or may dissipate under an attack, and even the commanders don‚Äôt know how many are dead, injured, or captured. Total dead is definitely in the thousands, maybe 10,000, maybe 5,000, or maybe just 2,000.\n> \n> But even at our command no one knows. But probably closer to 10,000 Russian soldiers killed. And we are not counting losses at DNR & LNR.\n> \n> Now even we kill Zelensky or take him prisoner, nothing will change. The level of hate toward us is similar to Chechnya. And now, even those loyal to us in Ukraine are publicly against us.\n> \n> Because all of this was planned at the top (in Russia), because we were told that such a scenario will not happen (Ukraine invasion) except only if we were to be attacked first.\n> \n> Because we were told that we need to maximize our threats in order to negotiate an outcome through peace. Because we were already preparing protests against Zelensky in Ukraine without ever considering invading Ukraine.\n> Now, civilian losses in Ukraine will follow a geometric pattern progression, and resistance against us will only get stronger. Infantries already tried to enter cities ‚Äì out of 20 paratrooper groups, only one had ‚Äúprovisional‚Äù success.\n> \n> Recall the invasion of Mosul. It‚Äôs a rule ‚Äì happens with every country, nothing new. To siege? Over the last decades in Europe ‚Äì Serbia being the best example, cities can remain functional under siege for years. Humanitarian convoys from Europe to Ukraine is only a matter of time\n> \n> Our conditional deadline is June. Conditional because in June there will be no economy left in Russia ‚Äì there will be nothing left.\n> \n> By and large, next week there will be a collapse (in Russia) to either of the two sides (for vs against war), simply because current tension (in Russia) is unsustainable.\n> \n> We have no analyses, we can‚Äôt make any forecasts in this chaos, no one will be able to say anything with any certainty (in Russia).\n> \n> To act through intuition, especially with high emotions, this is no poker game. But our bets will have to grow in size with hope that some option will succeed. The tragedy is that we can easily miscalculate, and as a result lose everything.\n> By and large, Russia does not have an out. There are no options for a possible victory, only of losses ‚Äì this is it. (BREAK FOR NOW, WILL CONTINUE POSTING TRANSLATION IN A BIT)\n> \n> (THIS UPCOMING 2nd HALF IS ARGUABLY MORE INTERESTING AND ENDS WITH A PLEASANT SURPRISE)\n> \"100% we‚Äôve repeated our mistake from last century, when we decided to kick the ‚Äúweak‚Äù Japan in order to achieve a quick victory, and it turned our army was in a state of total calamity.\n> \n> Then, we started a war till the victorious end, then we started conscripting the Bolsheviks for re-education in the army. Then these barely-known Bolsheviks picked up their anti-war slogans and started doing such things...\n> \n> From the pluses: We did everything to ensure there wasn‚Äôt even a hint that we sent penal military units to the front. If you conscript political prisoners and the socially undesirables, the moral spirit of the army will be in the negative.\n> \n> The enemy (Ukraine) is motivated. Monstrously motivated. Knows how to fight, plenty of capable commanders. They have weapons and support. We will simply establish a precedent of human catastrophe in the world.\n> \n> What we are afraid of the most: The top is trying to mask old problems with new problems. Largely for this reason Donbass happened in 2014 ‚Äì We needed to distract the West from the Russian Spring in Crimea, so Donbass‚Äô so-called crisis had to pull in all of the West's attention\n> \n> and become a bargaining chip. But even bigger problems started there. Then we decided to pressure Erdogan to get 4 pipes for the Southern Stream (gas) and entered Syria.\n> \n> This is after Suleimani (Islamic Revolutionary Guard) knowingly provided false info to us to solve his own problems. As a result, we couldn‚Äôt resolve the problem with Crimea, and Donbass‚Äô problems didn‚Äôt go away.\n> \n> Southern Stream was reduced to 2 pipes (gas), and Syria is hanging ‚Äì we leave and Assad will be toppled and we will look like idiots, and staying there is hard and pointless.\n> \n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/igorsushko/status/1500301348780199937\n\nBellingcat exec says it's probably legit in case anyone doubts. https://twitter.com/christogrozev/status/1500196510054637569",

A true Pyrrhic victory, his army in tatters, the country he conquers in ruins and then facing an insurgency for as long as he tries to occupy Ukraine.  Putin can sack a few generals, move another 100k conscripts into the battle zone and bomb the hell out of Ukraine, eventually he will grind down the Ukrainian army and air force but at what cost.\n\nFrom a Tactics perspective the attempted shock an awe is a total failure, the inability of his air force to function in theater is an embarrassment, his unit level operations and combined arms operations command and control functions are a joke.  Seriously his infantry don't even know how to advance at platoon level.  We used to fear the Russian mechanized divisions rolling across Europe till they got to the English channel, these days they cant even get across a peat bog.\n\nFrom a logistics perspective If you can't feed fuel and arm your guys 90 from your own boarder you should probably just pack up and go home.\n\nKleptocracy as a mighty weak tea when exposed to the real world, no matter how many generals he fires he still has crap equipment and a piss poor conscript army that can not function on the modern battle field.",

They describe the distinction of FSB and other administrative bodies that comes with this type of dictatorship perfectly. \n\nTo me, as a former public servant those letters perfectly describe a public service running into disaster because of politics. a few people believe them to be genuine or at least reflective of what they know. \n\nI‚Äôve read the translations by Igor Shushko& are in his website (or Twitter & FB). They pretty much anticipate this reaction. Still the most believable account of the administration from the inside. \n\nhttp://www.igorsushko.com/",

You can't communicate, because there might be a snitch.\n\nThe solution to a coordination problem is ambiguous signals. Disrespecting Putin in ways that are subtle and ambiguous. Watching for other people doing the same, or whether there's a sense that everyone else is being a bit off. Normally Putin would detect it, but it's hard to do so if you're hiding in a bunker. And the snitches won't be sure (not that there will be many, who wants to support a guy who is going to either trash the country or end up getting deposed). And if a lot of people are doing it, there's safety in numbers.\n\nMaybe they could even do it to his face in the meetings. He's not there in person, and he doesn't know how people normally talk, so they could just do a bit of a silly voice (changing their accent a bit, or talking a little higher or lower than usual). He wouldn't really know how people normally talk (since he's hiding in a bunker and getting a bit crazy I think), and no-one would be sure whether it's intentional (or just a bit of nerves because of meeting the boss) but people in the room will get a sense that *something* is off, especially if a few people are doing it.\n\nThen make a feint. Attack some idea that is kind of Putin-esque but not actually Putin's when he's not paying attention. How many people side with you?\n\nThen start with the body language or interruptions to his face. Accidently cut him off as he starts to speak. Glance around the room while he is talking. Nothing big, but do other people join in? At this point he knows something might be coming, but you have a good idea of whether there's the numbers, or whether you apologise and just take whatever he dishes out.\n\nHe knows it's coming anyway.

            "text": "A Romanian psychiatrist (Dr. Gabriel Diaconu, specialised in suicide behaviour)  has analysed Putin and his behaviour lately and the diagnose is not good. There are three personas: Putin the human being, Putin the president of Russian federation and Putin the legend. Putin the human being has his share of insecurities, childhood trauma, unfulfilled desires, unfulfilled sexual desires (he divorced his wife at 63 and married a young gimnast 30 years his junior), etc. Putin the president is what remains after Putin the human manifests his will and passes through the surrounding people in the state apparatus, generals, ministers, state Duma, etc. He is not alone, he doesn't take decisions by himself, he wants to, but still, there are other people that have to agree to his will. Putin the legend is what Putin the human wants to transgres above all, in human conscience and in history. He needs to pass the ideea of an invincibility cloak, like not even a fly would dare to fly without his approval. Anyways, Putin needs to tell a story to the world and the tragedy of what happens now is that NOBODY wants or needs to hear a story, let alone his story. Imprisoning his people that protest on the street is a sign of his desperate need for his people's approval on everything. He just increased to 15 years in prison the penalty for protesting and spreading \"false information\", like something that doesn't align with official propaganda. According to Dr. Diaconu, it is a bit strange that nobody so far has considered the possibility that Putin might have a \"strange suicide fantasy\", like doing it in front of people, live. Launching nuclear attacks on NATO countries is less likely (according to Dr. Diaconu) than actually punishing Russian people for not loving/adoring him. At this moment Putin is less stable emotionally than Hitler was in his last week alive. Putin now  senses that he lost everything from the moment he launched the attack in Ucraine, the whole world is loathing him fiercefully, his closed circle is questioning his abilities to controll the situation, his oligarch supporters are not at all pleased with the sanctions, the whole world has seen the minuscule capabilities of his mighty red army, it's just a matter of time until regular Russians will learn about the truth when they will face poverty and shortage of basic food, shelter, etc. What is the end of all this? There is no positive or neutral end for Putin, so he has to stretch this war as long as possible, with no conceivable result other than destroy Ucraine for spite, while the costs of the war are clearly accountable: millions of dollars every day, thousands of dead soldiers, tanks, helicopters and turbojets made popcorn by the Javelins, NLAWs and Stinger rackets, a country that hates him and the Russians for three generations from now on. Ok, what is the end, ask the journalists that interviewed Dr. Diaconu? Well, the most probable outcome will be that Putin will \"plunge his chest into the bayonet of one of his people\".",
