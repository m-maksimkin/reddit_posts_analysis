Thousands of them would be shut down practically overnight if they weren't able to reach the audiences they rely on. \n\nThen there's the sprawling ecosystem of external businesses that sell products and services off the back of Facebook's presence, like ad agencies and app developers, who would suddenly find themselves without anything to sell. \n\nFrom the perspective of users, while Facebook is extraordinarily unpopular on reddit, the reality is that hundreds of millions of people quite like it. Many of them rely on it as their only source of contact with friends and family, their only source of news, the only entertainment platform they use. The majority of them either aren't aware of, or don't care about, the privacy issues that regulators are rightly trying to control, so if they suddenly lost access to Facebook I'm sure that many of them would be furious and blame their country's government, or the EU itself, which could potentially have an impact on the outcome of future elections. \n\nBut of course, that all has to be weighed against the fact that the existence of Facebook has already had a major impact on the outcome of elections around the world. It can easily be argued that events like Brexit and the election of Trump never would have happened if bad actors like Cambridge Analytica and the Russian government hadn't extracted an insane amount of private data about hundreds of millions of people and weaponised it to misinform and manipulate low information voters using the tools Facebook willingly gave them. \n\nI dunno, it's fun to think about Facebook crashing and burning, and there's no question that something needs to be done to curtail its influence and propensity for abuse, but I do wonder what the true impact would be and whether it would be a net positive now that Facebook is so deeply ingrained in the lives of so many people.",

The same tax laws have led to many companies geo-blocking the EU from their product and services as it simply isn't worth the hassle of making a sale in the EU. This has reduced choice for EU residents. The Commission doesn't care because it is only concerned with building Fortress Europe where its residents' interaction with the rest of the world is heavily controlled. This is why it wants all data about EU citizens stored and processed on EU servers. The Commission would love to have an internal EU internet, so that it can excluded external companies in preference to its own, just like it has done in the physical world.",

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n> If Meta is not given the option to transfer, store and process data from its European users on US-based servers, Facebook and Instagram may be shut down across Europe, the social media giants&#039; owner reportedly warned in its annual report.\n\n> The key issue for Meta is transatlantic data transfers, regulated via the so-called Privacy Shield and other model agreements that Meta uses or used to store data from European users on American servers.\n\n> These model agreements are equally under scrutiny in Brussels and other parts of the EU. The Irish Data Protection Commission told Meta in August 2020 that it had provisionally concluded that the use of the model agreements was not in line with the GDPR. Processing the European data on American servers therefore had to be suspended by IDPC. However, this was merely a preliminary conclusion so, in effect, no change came about.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/slw5et/mark_zuckerberg_and_team_consider_shutting_down/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~621879 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **data**^#1 **Meta**^#2 **agreements**^#3 **model**^#4 **European**^#5",

Slowly because e.g. Amazon Web Services are still widely used although, according to the law, they also shouldn't be. \n\nThe courts are basically telling the companies here in the EU to do something about that as well.

They could move EU data and services handling EU data to a EU based data center.\n\nI work for a National institution at the center of a EU system, and we are currently in the process of reviewing all our providers contractual obligations to be inline with the new directive.\n\nAs a lot of these providers are American (Servicenow, Microsoft, …) they are moving (if it was not already done due to Brexit) the EU data to the EU. Sometimes to Ireland, the Netherlands, Germany, some what less to Belgium etc.\n\nBut even that is not really secure enough, as there is an American law that can force even American firms their subsidiaries to deliver all their (customers) data to the American government.\n\nSo we are currently also analyzing which encryption methods we could apply on at least the data in rest, so that when such an event occurs the EU stored data cannot be comprehensible retrieved.\n\nAs you would have guessed this means that the provider would provide the EU users with some extra protection to be sure that even when they are obliged to deliver said data to the US government that it should be unrecognizably encrypted. (Or give the user the means to intervene and proactively backup and wipe the data)\n\nThis would mean a lot of investment for firms like Facebook that don’t have regular paid services on offer.\n\nAnother service provider (eg. Microsoft) could more easily shift some of the expense to his paying customers .",

The way people communicate and socialize has changed dramatically in the last 20 years, and the shift by meta’s youngest demographic shift away from it shows it. \n\nWhat meta is asking for is a clear violation of the GDPR. \n\nI see a 50/50 chance of this happening. It appears they are trying to circumvent how they collect data from tracking you across your mobile devices/computers. The way they collect data is messy and intrusive, which is the reason they are struggling in the EU. Meta will most likely back off and learn how to market the traditional way.\n\n1. Unless meta can prove there is a need to process and control data in the US (which there isn’t) it will not be allowed to. \n2. They have to prove their is adequacy. The US does not meet these requirements. In general the US has issues with net neutrality and data security.\n3. The US is not on the list of permitted countries allowing outside transfers of data.\n\nSources\n\n\nhttps://gdpr-info.eu/issues/third-countries/\n\nhttps://gdpr.eu/companies-outside-of-europe/",

So, if they pull out, they'd have to say that the loss of revenue plus fines from not being compliant to laws will be worth it. I just don't see it. \n\nThey have data centers in Ireland, Denmark and Sweden. They would also have to shut them down or relocate to UK. They'd have to fire all of their EU employees or move them elsewhere.\n\nThat being said, they do control 300 million users worth of data in EU. That's a LOT of pictures, posts and interactions people will loose.\n\nMeta making such a move seriously would mean they see these laws as an existential crisis or they have an alternative loophole access to the EU market.
