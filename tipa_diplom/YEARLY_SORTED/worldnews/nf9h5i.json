My guess is (as with most formed opinions on the internet these days) many of you have never been to Galapagos and have seen first-hand the incredibly complex systems at play. Small donations help but are also like throwing solo-cups of water on a fire. Large private donations like this genuinely matter. The effects matter. The media attention matters. The personal reasons of Leo DON'T matter.\n\nIncidentally, in my time working in Galapagos in the early 2000's, I know Leo visited the islands out of personal interest in conservation. He helped aid efforts back then too. So this fits within his character. Sometimes people have personal interests, even the very famous.\n\nWill this fix the world, or even all the perils facing Galapagos? Of course not.
