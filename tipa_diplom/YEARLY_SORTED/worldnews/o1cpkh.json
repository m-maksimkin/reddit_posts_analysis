The truth whilst possibly black and white is never black and white in politics.\n\nPutin deflected questions while giving an answer. To answer if I am the killer, he said yes. He deflected that all are leaders killers and he is absolutely correct. \nTo human rights, he deflected but said yes in the same manner.\n\nBiden went from a strong arm position into a propaganda speech, and answered the first asked question with a lie. ‚ÄúAmerica never intervened in Democratic elections‚Äù, which unless you have not watched the news in a century is a ridiculous statement.\n\nPutin is a ‚Äúdisruptor‚Äù for the American media, and he was bombarded with demands of this and that, and some of it was valid criticism. Yet, when the wrongs of America are pointed out, it is whataboutism. Yes, Biden did not have any questions where he had to explain why America did X or Y, but that does not mean that giving a response in whataboutism is not legit. \n\n\nLearn to read between the lines, and learn to read from many news sources rather than one.

In the case of Israel, it's its status as the West's very loyal and atrocious colonial outpost in the Middle East. \n\n>It's also the fact that the Western media aren't remotely as independent or impartial as believed.
