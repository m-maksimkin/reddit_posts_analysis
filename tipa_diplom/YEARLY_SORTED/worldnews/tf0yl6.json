I’m an ex smoker so my reasoning is probably biased. \n\n1) I don’t think that forcing people into quitting or not doing something is going to be the best idea. If you had told me four years ago that I was legally being told I’m not allowed to smoke anymore, I would have told you to fuck off. Ultimately I had to make my own mind up to quit. I now know how good I feel having not been smoking for three years so I’ll never go back but old smoker me would have written it off. \n\n2) Like others have said, a law like this has never stopped illegal substances being consumed. Even when it’s 100% illegal for someone to buy cigarettes, they’ll still find a way to smoke them. Look at all of the illegal drugs. I also find it hard for a government to rationalise that smoking a cigarette is bad, but in the same breath legalise smoking weed. \n\n3) My approach would be to normalise healthier ways of kicking habits. Encourage vaping with a tax incentive - we know that putting anything into your lungs is bad, but smoking is an order of magnitude worse than vaping. Offer cheap or free patches, gum and lozenges. Make it harder to actually buy cigarettes, take them out of corner stores and petrol stations and only at dedicated outlets with limited opening hours and max purchase limits. \n\nLegislating a ban is a cheap way out of making it look like you’re doing something without actually doing anything.",

But because most have seen what tends to happen with banned drugs, they don’t stop being sold, they just stop being regulated. At least with selling them officially we can ensure minimum age, max nicotine amount, up to date smoke filter, and so on. \n\nI mean the reason the whole, weed is a gateway drug started, was because you’d get weed in equally illegal places as hard drugs like heroin. As well as there has been tests (can’t remember which country it was from, but I assume USA before some states legalized weed, as often most English written populous test tend to be from there), that a lot of weed sold on the street, includes byproducts of other drugs, most commonly nicotine - even before you rolled it together with a cigarette that had nicotine, but sometimes worse. With that being said, while I trust my memory, memory is never perfect, so I cannot say what degree it was too, or if it might be outdated amounts of old, so take what I’ve said with a grain of salt, like you should all things on the internet, especially if they can’t cite what they say - like me rn, so if you’re a government person, find actual proofs of this, if you wanted to use it in an argument for against ban on drugs.",

I think the first time I was ever refused sale was when I was 15.  And didn't really run into a problem purchasing until I was closer to 18, when I could eventually legally buy it.\n\nWas pretty tired and done with smoking when I was about 20.\n\nHowever, I continued to smoke a few packs a day for 20 more years.   I finally was able to quit when I was 40.\n\nI'm 47 now, and still find myself going through the motions of smoking, having urges on a daily basis, and occassionally (briefly) considering smoking. Nothing too serious, but its still there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am for the prohibition of tobacco.  Even today, with smoking for the most part socially unacceptable I don't think the stigma is enough.\n\nProhibition would fail to completely stop tobacco use and trade like it always does.  But it would be effective at curbing the near constant use that is possible without prohibition.  And it is that constant habit forming use, combined with the addictive nature, that can form a lifelong problem. And starting at an early age can effect the rest of your life.   Complete prohibition would seriously curb the number of kids that start early.  And IMO it would be worth it.\n\nIt is not herion, but that is sort of the problem; how benign it can seem and initially be. You can operate on it fine.  In fact after the initial hi, unless you take a decent break, you will never get hi again, you are just addicted with no 'benefit.'  It is stupid AF.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think a decent amount of time of complete prohibition and massive stigma against it is neccassary. And probably after a time that control could loosen up if education and respect of what it is could be instilled.\n\nJust my take on it.",
