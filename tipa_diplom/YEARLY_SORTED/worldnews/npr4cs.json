You publish some super early preliminary results that would suggest you could cure cancer (if you ignore all the other aforementioned challenges), media teams get a whiff and publish/overhype/take completely out of context your work, but you’re not exactly going to correct anyone or say anything because all of a sudden your university is getting a lot of publicity and you just fast-tracked yourself to the front of the tenure line…..I could go on",
