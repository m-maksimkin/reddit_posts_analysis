All of us have served our \r\ncountry and are proud to have done so. For that reason, we are particularly upset and angry that \r\nPrince Andrew remains a member of the armed forces and continues to hold military titles, positions and ranks, including that of Vice Admiral of the Royal Navy.*\n\r\n*It’s been eleven years since the press revealed Prince Andrew’s inappropriate friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. Since that time Prince Andrew has shown himself to be uncooperative and less than truthful about that relationship. He has made several unbelievable claims during a BBC interview in late 2019, which only led to him 'stepping back' but not stepping down.*\r\n\n*Now that Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted of sex trafficking, a number of facts of the matter \r\nhave been established in a court of law. Regardless of the result of Virginia Giuffre’s civil case against Prince Andrew, his position in Britain's armed forces is now untenable.*\n\r\n*Were this any other senior military officer it is inconceivable that he would still be in post. Officers of the British armed forces must adhere to the very highest standards of probity, honesty and honourable conduct. These are standards which Prince Andrew has fallen well short of. It is hard not to see, when senior officers are reportedly describing him as ‘toxic’, that he has brought the services he is associated with into disrepute.*\n\n*We are therefore asking that you take immediate steps to strip Prince Andrew of all his military \r\nranks and titles and, if necessary, that he be dishonourably discharged.*\r\n\n*We understand that he is your son, but we write to you in your capacity as head of state and as \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy and Air Force. These steps could have been taken at any \r\ntime in the past eleven years. Please do not leave it any longer.*\n\r\n*Yours sincerely*",

It must be really really that bad (even worse than what we already know) and the royal family clearly knows THE GIG IS UP and that much more damaging information is about to come out. It’s going to be bad for them… They must know that there is more, indisputable evidence coming…  whatever it is, it must be bad enough where Prince Andrew’s involvement can not longer be denied or played down. No way to deflect. No way to use entitlement, money and connections to get out of this one. This move is calculated. The Queen is having to do some more serious damage control. They can’t protect Andrew anymore, they have to fully set him loose in an attempt to protect and salvage the reputation of the monarchy. \n\n…. Taking away his titles/ HRH is “the Firm’s” way of proactively managing the ensuing PR crisis. Distancing. Disassociating. Additional demotions were needed… it’s sending a message…… as if they haven’t known about these allegations and identified Prince Andrew’s involvement with Epstein as a “potential issue” for years, just hoping it would never go mainstream, become sensationalized… \n\nOn a side note: One of my theories regarding Megxit is that it was actually motivated by this whole impending PR nightmare with prince Andrew…. Megan and Harry knew the allegations were true… and there was evidence to back it up and that it was really really bad… they left abruptly because they knew it was their window to GTFO, disassociate and rebrand before everything, inevitably came out. Within the royal family; this probably goes so much deeper than anyone knows…. Who knows.. maybe even multiple family members will become implicated..
