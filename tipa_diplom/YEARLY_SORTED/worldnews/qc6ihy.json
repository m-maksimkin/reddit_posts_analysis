To narrow down when the Norse arrived in Newfoundland, University of Groningen chronologists Michael Dee and Margot Kuitems, along with their colleagues, looked for evidence of the year a solar storm bombarded Earth&#039;s atmosphere with radiation.\n\n> Dendrochronologists discovered the carbon-14 spike and dated it to 993 CE in trees from sites around the world.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/qcc6mq/new_archaeological_find_proves_that_vikings_were/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 2.02, ~604499 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **Trees**^#1 **Norse**^#2 **date**^#3 **fragments**^#4 **wood**^#5",

When people start calling history myths and ideas, we are in deep shit.\n\nSo what if the Vikings arrived before Christopher Columbus? That is a distraction to hide White Supremacy and Elitism that have now infested the world with soul snatching divisions and slavery that manifest in many different forms by different countries and Empires. People are not understanding that before Columbus and his White Domination the mixed races and ethnicities were actually free and coexisted and there was no tax or government or military or religious institutions (those are all forms of slavery that have stolen and corrupted our essence; our innocent souls and spirit have become insidious and detrimental without us even realizing it; the indigenous and aboriginals tried to tell us). They funnel our energy towards job/career status, levels and positions; religion; money; technologies; entertainment; sports; and celebrity saga in order to keep us uneducated, placated, distracted and ignorant as they hide in the shadows in order for them to secretly plan and morph their nefarious and seedy domination and slavery to hide their true nature and to match with modern times so we become confused and can't see them clearly.  \n\nPeople need to awaken up. The psychopathic and evil Ruling Wealthy Elites all around the globe have shafted the public under Domination and siege. When they create this slavery and shape the way we think and feel in that we're unstoppable, we can do anything and we'll all be rich and successful, that blinds us to the lies and creates a collective psychosis that eventually leads to collapse.  Everything they feed us is a lie and if we don't voice up, we're headed down an even more insidious path of soul and spirit slavery that can lead to the destruction and annihilation of everything. Science can be used as a self destructive tool, least we forget that we, The American Empire, used the scientific community and Science to create the atomic and hydrogen bombs?! HEEELLLOOOO!!!! My roommate actually called these \"ideas\". \"IDEAS\"?! When people start calling history \"ideas\" and \"myths\", it creates a frightening amnesia as to how we all got here and gives credibility that we are in deep shit.
