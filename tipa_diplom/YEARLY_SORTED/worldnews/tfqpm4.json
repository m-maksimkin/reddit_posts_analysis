In addition, Georgia Pacific makes a ton of paper products for offices and lumber products at Home Depot and Lowes.\n\nKoch also owns Invist, which includes Lycra, Tactel, and Thermolite.  They also manufacture Stainmaster (R) carpets, along with a bunch of outdoor brands.  (Note:  Others are questioning this part so take with a grain of salt.  It looks like they may license some of the technology and have sold some brand names.  The brands Invista still owns are: Antron, Dacron, DBE, Dytek, and Cordura.

But if you are in engineering or procurement in an electronics company you could steer away from molex and choose other brands.  The same goes for Georgia Pacific.

However, despite fame as political influencers, their primary activities centered around running Koch Industries Inc., of which they owned over 80%.1﻿\n\nKoch Industries is a private company that has annual revenues topping $110 billion.2﻿ The company is not really a single business, but rather a conglomerate of different companies under one umbrella. On June 5, 2018, David Koch retired from all roles related to Koch Industries due to health reasons and he later passed away on Aug. 23, 2019.\n\nKEY TAKEAWAYS\n\nKoch companies collectively employ over 130,000 people in 70 countries, and more than half are in the United States.3﻿\n\nThe company owns subsidiaries that produce various goods such as resins, polymers, glass, oil pipelines, tissue paper, robotics, and more.\n\nKoch Industries controls some lesser-known companies as well, such as Matador Cattle Company, the Koch Chemical Technology Group, Koch Disruptive Technologies, and Koch Minerals.\n\nKoch Ag and Energy Solutions operate three separate companies: Koch Energy, Koch Methanol, and Koch Fertilizer.\n\nKoch subsidiaries are also involved in investing, commodities trading, and ranching.\n\nKoch Industries' Revenue Growth\n\nBecause Koch Industries is not a publicly-traded company, some of its key financial information is not readily available to investors. However, per an SEC fact sheet, the conglomerate has, since 1960, seen its value grow at a rate 16 times greater than that of the S&P 500.4﻿\n\nThe industries under the Koch umbrella are diverse, ranging from companies that deal with energy to spandex. Koch companies manufacture paper, process minerals, create fertilizers, and refine oil. Some of the subsidiaries are also involved in ranching, commodities trading, and investing.\n\n1. Flint Hills Resources\n\n￼\n\nFlint Hills offers petroleum products, gasoline, diesel fuels, jet fuels, and other oil products, as well as those related to polymers and other chemicals. The company's ethanol plants have a combined production capacity of roughly 725 million gallons per year.5﻿ The company also explores biofuels. Flint Hills markets a variety of chemical applications, coatings, automotive parts, and asphalt and sells products on a worldwide basis, including the United States, Asia, Australia, Europe, South America, Central America, and New Zealand.\n\n2. Georgia-Pacific\n\n￼\n\nKoch Industries acquired Georgia Pacific on Dec. 23, 2005, for $21 billion.6﻿ The company employs more than 30,000 people in over 180 locations. It is based in Atlanta, Georgia, but markets worldwide.7﻿\n\nOriginally known as Georgia Hardwood Lumber Co., Georgia-Pacific is a pulp and paper company that produces paper, tissue, toilet paper, and building products. The list of products also includes the well-known brands Quilted Northern tissue, Brawny paper towels, and Dixie cups. Wallboard, napkins, boxes, paper dispensers, and pulp round out the company’s offerings.\n\n3. Guardian Industries\n\n￼\n\nKoch Industries completed its full acquisition of Guardian Industries on Feb. 1, 2017, after earlier buying a 44.5% stake in the company.8﻿ Based in Michigan, Guardian Industries employees 18,000 people in the United States, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia.9﻿\n\nThink of Guardian Industries as a glass company. It manufactures glass for automobiles, building applications, fiberglass insulation, and coated glass for architectural needs. The company is also known for its research and development of new applications for glass, such as energy-efficient windows.\n\n4. Invista\n\n￼\n\nKoch Industries acquired Invista for $4.2 billion, including assumption of debt and certain interests, in April 2004.10﻿ In total, Invista owns nearly two dozen brands and is involved in fabrics, fibers, plastics, polymers, chemicals, and the licensing of technology. 11﻿\n\nInvista makes spandex, resins, chemicals, and polymers and is a spinoff of DuPont. The company concentrates on textiles and owns numerous brands such as Lycra, Tactel, and Thermolite, as well as brands for outdoor gear, carpet (Stainmaster), and luggage. When Koch Industries purchased Invista in 2004, the conglomerate merged the polymers subsidiary with its existing KoSa subsidiary in order to create a new company under the Invista name.12﻿\n\n5. Molex\n\n￼\n\nKoch Industries paid $7.2 billion to acquire Molex in Sept. 2013. The company counted nearly 100,000 products in its catalog in 2013 and had more than 35,000 employees in 15 countries. For the year ending June 30, 2013, Molex had about $3.6 billion in revenues.13﻿\n\nMolex creates electronics to solve technical problems in electric cars, robotic surgery, and even the Mars Exploration Rover. The company is also involved in fiber optics, smartphones, and defense applications. With about 80 years of history, Molex has been a critical part of the development of some of the most prominent technologies of today, including the first cell phones, HDTVs, and car radios.14﻿\n\n6. Koch Ag & Energy Solutions\n\nThe Koch Ag and Energy Solutions company operates three Koch Industries subsidiaries.15﻿ Koch Fertilizer manufactures and markets a wide variety of fertilizer products used in the agriculture industry and operates a global distribution network with terminals in North America, South America, and Europe.\n\n$110 billion\n\nThe annual revenues from Koch Industries, making it one of the biggest private companies in North America.\n\nMeanwhile, Koch Energy Services markets electricity and natural gas in North American markets. It uses its expertise in market analysis, purchasing, hedging, and energy logistics to provide comprehensive services to other companies. Lastly, Koch Methanol is a methanol supplier. It was originally established to fulfill the needs of Koch Industries subsidiaries, but it now works with other companies as well.\n\n7. Koch Pipeline Company\n\nKoch Pipeline owns pipelines throughout Texas, Minnesota, Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Illinois. The pipelines transport oil and refined petroleum, as well as natural gas. Koch Pipeline Company operates approximately 4,000 miles of pipeline in six U.S. states, the longest of which include the 580-mile Wood River line in Missouri and a 540-mile pipeline system in South Texas, both of which transport crude oil.16﻿ 17﻿\n\nOther Notable Companies\n\nKoch Industries also holds a variety of smaller subsidiaries as well as the major brands already mentioned. The Matador Cattle Company operates three ranches with 12,000 head of cattle, for instance, while the Koch brothers have their name on a variety of other subsidiary brands.18﻿ These include Koch Engineering Solutions, Koch Disruptive Technologies, and Koch Minerals.19﻿",

[Disinformation is their favorite game](https://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MacLean-How-the-Koch-Network-Uses-Disinformation-copy.pdf).  They have been pro-oil to the point of [even being anti renewable energy](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/How-the-Koch-Brothers-Manipulate-Climate-Change-Studies.html).  I'm sure they'll try to load the news channels up with \"clarifications\" in the coming weeks.  Don't fall for it.  They are already saying one thing, but clearly believing in their hearts that Ukraine doesn't matter.  \n\n\nThey probably want to keep a foot in Russia to snap up all the political points and oil-related business possible.  Which would leave just India, North Korea, Koch, and less than 14 businesses as being Russian apologists in their actual business actions.  \n\n>\"While Guardian's business in Russia is a very small part of Koch, we will not walk away from our employees there or hand over these manufacturing facilities to the Russian government so it can operate and benefit from them,\" Dave Robertson, president and CEO of Koch Industries, said Wednesday in a statement posted by the company.  \n>  \n>Calling Russia's attack on Ukraine \"an affront to humanity\" that \"violates our company's values and principles,\" Robertson also said the company has provided financial assistance to workers and their families from Ukraine and other aid to those affected in neighboring countries.  \n>  \n>\"To be clear, Koch companies are complying with all applicable sanctions, laws and regulations governing our relationships and transactions within all countries where we operate,\" he added. \"We will continue to closely monitor the situation and keep you updated as needed.\" Arguing against sanctions  \n>  \n>Meantime, political groups supported by Charles Koch, the right-wing billionaire who is chairman and CEO of Koch Industries, are making a public case against imposing economic sanctions against Russia, according to Popular Information, a left-leaning newsletter run by Judd Legum.  \n>  \n>Stand Together, a nonprofit founded by Charles Koch, \"supports targeted sanctions against Russia in response to its immoral invasion of Ukraine. We also believe that sanctions are a legitimate tool of statecraft. However, broad-based economic sanctions rarely achieve their desired policy outcomes,\" Dan Caldwell, the group's vice president for foreign policy, tweeted on Monday.  \n>  \n>Caldwell previously suggested that the U.S. remain neutral on the conflict in Ukraine.  \n>  \n>A similar message comes from Will Ruger, president of another Charles Koch-backed group, the American Institute for Economic Research, or AIER, according to Popular Information's reporting. \"The United States can and should do very little for Ukraine,\" Ruger said in a March 2 podcast with Reason Magazine, a libertarian publication also supported by Charles Koch. \"Ukraine simply doesn't matter to America's security or our prosperity.\"",
