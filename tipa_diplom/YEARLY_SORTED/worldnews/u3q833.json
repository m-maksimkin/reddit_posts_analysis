Any player of the game was used to the idea that to knock out a Slava or Ticonderoga would take a dozen or more missiles. The long range weapon systems were effective as were the point defense systems.\n\nBut the claim here is that only two were needed. OK, in general shipboard anti-missile defense systems have not proven as effective in practice as in theory, but even so, the Slava point defenses were kitted out after the influential lesson of the sinking of HMS Sheffield.\n\nBeing reasonable we can remind ourselves that the Moskva is 40 years old, which is as old as the General Belgrano was in the Falkland's war. Expecting it to be operating at full reliability is unreasonable, the idea that it sank due to a random fire is plausible, and one could say also that on a 40 year old ship, perhaps the once formidable radar system and weapon systems were not really working. So maybe that's all there is to it, and Ukraine launched a weak attack with their home grown missiles because why not, and it just happened to work because the Slava is old and weak and not functioning at all at full capacity.\n\nBut I would also consider the possibility that this attack was with American support, and with a modern American weapon system.

The Russian guy finds a glass bottle.  Opens it and out pops a genie.  Genie says, \"Here is a solid iron ball.  If one of you can make me laugh, using this iron ball, I'll transport you off this island and back to your home with my magic.\"  \n\nSo, the French guy grabs the ball and does an AMAZING juggling/mime act.  No dice.  Genie doesn't crack a smile.\n\nThe Englishman grabs the ball and proceeds to do a GREAT comedy skit of a guy trying to play billiards with a heavy iron ball.  Genie just frowns.\n\nFinally the Russian guy picks up the ball, scratches his head, \"Blyat!  Shto delaet?!\" then drops it, shouts \"pizdyets!\" and starts crawling around on his hands and knees.  Suddenly the genie starts belly-laughing, and then POOF!  Russian guy is gone, back home to Mother Russia.\n\nWhen the genie finally stops laughing the Frenchman and Englishman look at him and said, \"What's so funny about that?!\"\n\nAnd the genie replies, \"Well, first that Russian idiot broke the iron ball...and then he fucking lost it!\"...and starts laughing again.\n\nYes, that is a Russian joke, told to me, by a bunch of Russians.
