What can we do? How can we help to make sure that they get something to backfill the planes that they are handing over to the Ukrainians?\"  \n>  \n>Transcript: Secretary of State Antony Blinken on \"Face the Nation\"  \n>  \n>A White House spokesperson told CBS News the Biden administration is working on the capabilities it could provide to backfill Poland if it decided to transfer planes to Ukraine but noted there are several questions that arise from a decision to do so, including how the jets could be transferred from Poland to Ukraine.",

If an attack by Russian forces contaminates NATO members, this risk alone would normally force NATO to end the war by joining it with all its fire power, so no Russian soldier can come near an Ukrainian nuclear power plant anymore.\n\nThe only reason NATO does not intervene right now are the Russian atomic bombs. Without that, NATO would end this war now by eradicating every single Russian soldier on Ukrainian ground, so all refugees can go home, and no nuclear power plant is in the risk of a meltdown.",

We're drinking, having a good time, and we see this big wanna-be badass dude at the end of the bar starting some shit with a smaller guy, although hes a tough lil SOB. Now, we dont know this tough lil SOB, but big badass stands up and smacks his glasses off, and proceeds to continue smackin tough lil dude around, cuz he cant see. \n\nSo my 1 buddy, who wears glasses, decides to toss his own personal glasses to the tough lil SOB on the ground, so he can at least see and defend himself.\n\nSee, we dont want to get involved, in case the cops are called, but we just want the poor fella to have a standing chance against the big brute. Although, when i see some bs like this, im normally more than happy to join in, and remind the big brute to pick on someone his own size. Or me and all my friends will beat em to a pulp in the parking lot, but i dont know this lil dude or what he did to recieve the ass-whoopin, so im not gonna get involved.\n\nAnyways, now the lil guy on the ground has some new glasses, and can stand back up to fight, but my buddy is half-blind, cause he donated his glasses.\n\nNow, my buddy and I have been talking for a while now about me selling him a couple used pairs of glasses that i had sitting around in a drawer,  and this seems the most opportune time to make that sale to him, as hes recently donated his only glasses for a noble cause. \n\nHeres the question. Should the big wanna-be badass at the end of the bar be pissed that my buddy tossed his old glasses to the guy on the ground so he could get back up and fight? \n\nShould he be pissed that i made the offer to sell my old glasses to my buddy as soon as he donated his glasses to that guy on the ground?",
