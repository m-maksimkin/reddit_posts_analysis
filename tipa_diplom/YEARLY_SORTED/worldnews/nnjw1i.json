Like something the size of a small country, and somehow parking in orbit above China, so I can just yell at Xi. Like... Hey you fucking asshole! Stop being a fucking douchebag and let people think for themselves! Like... Just yell in his face in such a way that he has no choice but to directly respond in order to make it stop. Sorta like we did with Noriega when he holed up at the Vatican and we blasted Metallica non stop until he came out. Or maybe we just fly a billion drones over his house and use them like a giant TV display to constantly play videos of the fucked up things the CCP had gone out of their way to censor so that they have no choice but to address it. I won't play the \"fuck China\" game... Because it's not Chinese people that are responsible for their repression... It's fucking Winnie Xi Bitch that's responsible. He's as bad for China as Hitler was for Germany. All of these repressive regimes need the same treatment. I wish for a world where people didn't try to get one over on other people. Where humans feel an obligation to help other humans, and don't spend their energy trying to \"get theirs\" at the expense of someone else. It's fucking infuriating that I feel so very powerless to affect any kind of change. Who wants in on this drone idea? Maybe I should start a Kickstarter campaign....",

Everyone here seems to be ignoring the part of the article where it says this vigil has been happening every year for 30 years, and the only reason this one is being cracked down on is because of the whole pandemic thing. They advice people to light their candles at other places without massive congregations instead.\n\nNow, obviously those previous 30 years of no interference have happened because HK was an independent state and China could do nothing about it before, but considering we are in the middle of a global pandemic right now, the waters are muddied enough to not be able to take any decisive conclussions, and we probably won't know if China is outright banning this vigil or not until next year when covid restrictions are fully lifted.\n\nRemember the golden rule of \"don't read just the headline and form an opinion based on that\". Headlines are often written to be clickbaity and inflamatory on purpose.\n\nYou can read this and dismiss me as some kind of chinese sycophant or an astroturfing bot for daring to not join in the circlejerk or something, but don't forget that nobody is immune to propaganda and manipulation, and media outlets do this kind of thing all the time for a variety of motives. It takes 1 minute of reading and 10 seconds of thinking to realize this article is manipulative as hell, even if you understandably dislike the chinese government.\n\nKeep your wits about yourself and all that.",

What's important is not really this one event or how many died in it or who's at fault, but not to encourage people to question its leadership, which must shown to be, in the larger scheme of things, infallible like the Pope.\n\nThat said, previously within the party there were [certainly debates about past mistakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward#cite_note-111). Xi's rise really put a stop to the voices for moderation internally, it seems. The new Cold War with the West is all he needs to consolidate power for another 2-3 decades (he's 67, who knows...).",
