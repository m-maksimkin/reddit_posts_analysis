Imagine how america would feel if Mexico joined CSTO\n-Ukraine has ethnically Russian areas that want to be a part of Russia, and ethnically Ukrainian areas that want to be Ukrainian \n-Ukraine has the capability to draw this out indefinitely. Kyiv May fall but if we have seen anything it’s that they won’t stop resisting \n-Russia has the troops and equipment to continuously destroy Ukraine indefinitely and has WMDs to compensate for losses\n\nMy best case scenario:\n-Ukraine gives up the Donbas and Crimea\n-both sides agree to a 30 mile wide DMZ along their entire border\n-Russia withdraws, sanctions are lifted\n-Ukraine gets to join the EU but not NATO\n\nBOth sides win and lose, but that’s how this war is going. Ukraine will not win, but Russia will suffer tremendous losses both militarily and economically if they continue. I think Putin’s original goal was for this to be over before Monday. If he ends it now there’s a good chance their economy can be spared alot of damage. Of course it’s a bandaid on the situation but eventually I think it can be worked out \n\nMost dangerous path-Russia uses this as a ploy and PR stunt. I don’t think this is very likely though bc failed negotiations aren’t likely going to change the minds of Russians dealing with 20% loss of the value of the ruble. The people and the oligarchs don’t want this war. Putin’s best strategy here is reunite Russia with these territories through treaty. He can say he won, he can say he got the west to stand down their sanctions. In exchange we can say that we secured peace in Eastern Europe and if anything it benefits Ukraine bc they no longer have to deal with fighting rebel groups",

This support is a fad for many. The reality is that most people don't know what they're supporting. I bet you that a significant number can't place Ukraine on a map, explain its basic history or tell the years that it was part of the Soviet Union. We have to ask ourselves, are the U.S. and the West always right? Is it possible that we were soft aggressors towards Russia since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union? We've continually rubbed Russia's nose through the ground, despite them giving concessions through the years. Nato has expanded ever east despite the promise of the '90s of \"not one more inch east\" after Russia allowed a unified Germany to join Nato. This was in spite of Germany having partially destroyed Russia twice during the World Wars. What's playing out now in Ukraine happened similarly in 2008 in Georgia, and Crimea in 2014. Did we not expect that Russia would still respond the same? American foreign policy has led to the current carnage we're seeing, but we were too stubborn to give concessions. The only country that is going to really get hurt is Ukraine. Stuck in a fight between two divorced parents. What's ensuing is litigation for custody, or at least, visitation rights. Meanwhile, Ukraine is the one that is getting wrecked to bits and will need a really good therapist afterward.\n\nIf anyone is interested in a better explanation of this I encourage you to watch John Mearshimer's lecture \"Why is Ukraine the West's Fault\" on Youtube. Alternatively, Henry Kissinger's article \"To settle the Ukraine crisis, start at the end\" in the Washington Post.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for my rant but I just felt I had to say it somewhere. And no, I don't support Putin nor am I trying to justify the unjustifiable (his aggression). I am just trying to read the history and not follow along with another hashtag.",

People wanting no less from a peace than Russia ceding Crimea to Ukraine and withdrawing recognition and support from the breakaway states in the east will likely have to wait for a much different situation - probably for Russian troops to be fully expelled from Ukraine - and even then the Russians are unlikely ever to accept any peace that surrenders Russian territory to a foreign state, which for them includes Crimea.",

He'd be Jimmy Carter 2.0 and the Democrats would be destroyed a political force. \n\nLikewise, if Putin doesn't succeed in getting Donbas and neutralising Ukraine, if Zelenskiy stays in power in Ukraine, he's dead and it would be the most significant defeat for Russia since when? 1917? The Crimean War? He can't make any concessions either, so there simply isn't any way out.\n\nThere is no diplomatic way out of this - the US has to commit fully to regime change in Russia, because no diplomatic compromise would be acceptable politically for Biden. The only way they can bring that about is to cross their fingers and hope for a coup, which itself could very easily trigger a massive civil war within Russia that would destablise the entire world for a generation, or he has to commit to a direct war on Russia with the goal of toppling Putin and putting in a pro-West leader by force. \n\nWe are now, for all intents and purposes, at war with Russia.

For all of the Ukrainian success we have heard about, the reality is that Russia still has yet to make a move on any of the major cities, despite having a clear route for an attack and a bombardment on three of their largest cities. The Russians outgun and outman the Ukrainians, massively, but they still have mostly only done minor incursions into the urban areas, instead largely surrounding the outskirts of them. \n\nThey are 100% going to tell Ukraine: Accept our demands now, or we will flatten your cities. \n\nThis isn't a negotiation, its a hostage situation. Zelensky is right to go for it, but he needs to understand that the minor successes so far do not mean shit when Russia begins to fire hundreds of bombs into a densely populated city every half hour, or when 50,000 troops attack your city instead of a few dozen.",

Here begins a new period both in ideology and in the very model of our socio-economic system - but this is worth talking about separately a little later.\nRussia is restoring its unity - the tragedy of 1991, this terrible catastrophe in our history, its unnatural dislocation, has been overcome. Yes, at a great cost, yes, through the tragic events of a virtual civil war, because now brothers, separated by belonging to the Russian and Ukrainian armies, are still shooting at each other, but there will be no more Ukraine as anti-Russia. Russia is restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together - in its entirety of Great Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians. If we had abandoned this, if we had allowed the temporary division to take hold for centuries, then we would not only betray the memory of our ancestors, but would also be cursed by our descendants for allowing the disintegration of the Russian land.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin holds an operational meeting with permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation - RIA Novosti, 1920, 25.02.2022” source: https://web-archive-org.translate.goog/web/20220226051154/https://ria.ru/20220226/rossiya-1775162336.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=wapp",

Therefore, Ukraine gets all of their nukes. Russia is no longer a nuclear power. After all, Ukraine has shown restraint, compassion, and responsibility, despite extreme provocation. This is exactly the mentality we all want in charge of a nuclear arsenal. So Ukraine inherits all the Russian nukes.\n\nRussia abdicates their seat on the UN security council in favor of Ukraine. All the arguments for possession of nuclear weapons apply to a seat on the UNSC.\n\nRussia draws down their military and accepts the protection of Ukraine.\n\nThe easiest way to accomplish both of these goals is actually simple.\n\nUkraine absorbs Russia. Russia becomes, once again, as they were in the past, East Ukraine. \n\nOk, *now* we negotiate. Russia wants to unify Russia and the Ukraine? Sure, no problem, just unify under the Blue and Yellow.\n\nOh, that's not what you meant? Ok, what do you really want? Crimea, Donbas and Luhansk? How about we allow you to remain in those 3 regions, but you accede to our requirements: Transfer all nuclear weapons, transfer the seat on the UNSC, and draw down the military while accepting the protection of Ukraine.\n\nOne for one trades. You permanently withdraw from one of the regions, we give up one of the requirements. You think our requirements are unreasonable? We feel the same way about Russian occupation. Choose wisely.\n\nOh, you want to maintain control of the nuclear arsenal, retain your seat on the UNSC, and maintain your (laughable) military?

It's hard to imagine Ukraine would accept Crimea staying occupied, but the writing is on the wall for how this will go if Russia escalates attacks. Weapons are probably pouring into Ukraine now, and at some point NATO would have to call civilian bombings war crimes and join in, starting ww 3.\n\nIt's important to keep in mind what Putin really wanted: to steal the gas reserves beside Crimea, and to secure fresh water access for Crimea, which had all but ran out. This was large scale theft, which was supposed to be easier. Putin will want to push on to an ugly victory but things are only going to get worse, no matter how much gets destroyed in Ukraine, or how many are killed. The economic hit is just starting; if Europe commits to stopping buying Russian oil Russia is finished. It's almost impossible for that to happen but escalating destruction in Ukraine would force the US and Europe to take unthinkable steps. In the end the end of the world might sound better to Putin than the fallout. The West needs Russia to drop this before what happens to them isn't reversible. With no token concession offerred everyone might be screwed, on all sides, but at this point that being Crimea staying occupied seems unlikely. The worst could follow.",
