That said, at what point does Putin receive condemnation as a mass murderer? Not by Ukrainians, or even the international community, but by his own people? How long is he going to throw his citizens (whether or not the are trained/armed) at the buzz saw until he gives up or is made to feel enough pressure to stop this?\n\nI can't help thinking of the real people that were moving that convoy of fuel in. Perhaps one, two, maybe 80% of the Russian soldiers were driving TO support the objective but we're no IN support of the onjective. The whole time some could have been thinking \"I did NOT sign up for this\", but were too afraid to go AWOL.\n\nHistorically, modern militaries comprise their foot soldiers of those who are of lower median income levels, and often come from areas with less opportunity for advancement through other means, whether through the result of systemic governance issues or flat-out neglect/targeted limitations.\n\nHow many of these soldiers joined the Russian military thinking of it as a way to just make a living, thinking they'd never go to war? Perhaps being flat-out convinced? And now they're dead. And why? Is it really about resources? Strategic geography? Pure ego?\n\nPerhaps none of those on the ground actually believe what I hope they believe. If that is the case, then I throw out any and all sympathy. However the public outcry in Russia is, in my opinion, nothing short of shocking. It is my hope that SOME of the Russian soldiers know how vile this whole operation is, didn't want to be a part of it, and only continued to follow orders out of fear of what would be waiting for them when they returned home.\n\nFor those individuals, if they exist, I feel very sad.",

Legally diesel fuel is not even flammable at atmospheric pressure and temperatures.\n\nThat's why diesel engines don't have spark plugs. Gasoline is both highly flammable and highly explosive. The same is not true with diesel fuel I'm sure there are many people here who have heating systems that run off of a 300-gallon diesel fuel tank sitting in their basement. Aka oil heat.
