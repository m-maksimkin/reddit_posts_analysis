Due to our 24 news cycle and the constant need for attention-getting headlines, we rarely seem to stay focused on any one thing for longer than a few weeks at most before the next ‚Äúthing‚Äù develops. So maybe for a few weeks we‚Äôll be singing kumbaya around the campfire about Ukraine, people will put out TikToks and memes and such. Eventually though, something new will grab our attention, maybe a TrumpCo criminal conviction or a Jan 6 development or maybe a natural disaster or a new movie or whatever. The focus of popular culture and our politicians seems incredibly fickle.\n\nMost likely, the Russians will eventually overwhelm the Ukranians through sheer numbers (I hope it doesn‚Äôt happen, but that seems like the eventual outcome), and then what? Ukranians I presume, based on the tough resistance they‚Äôve put up this far, will continue to resist the Russians even after they potentially take Kyiv, so it‚Äôll switch to a long term resistance movement against an occupying force. In the eyes of Russia, they‚Äôll become terrorists and maybe they do take on questionable tactics. America may provide some support, but there will be the fear of getting involved in a shooting war with Russia, so I think our support won‚Äôt be as open as it is now because we won‚Äôt be dealing with a sovereign nation state anymore.\n\nAmerica won‚Äôt be able to maintain the level of focus needed (we‚Äôll continue to provide some support I think, but not as much) and the public will just shift to something else. That doesn‚Äôt make what Russia is doing right by any means, but it‚Äôs likely an accurate assessment.",

It happened to Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, most people didn't even realize that Ukraine got invaded back in 2014 until recently. People just don't have the capacity to care about wars for a long period of time. Either human nature or how society simple is nowadays.\n\nSo they aren't wrong. We will likely grow tired of the war and tired of protesting it. This doesn't only go for the west. Lots of people in Russia are protesting and we have to find a sustainable way to keep people focused.\n\nThat all said, a great way to keep people glued to the news is to bring up the threat of nuclear war over and over again. If they really wanted us to forget then they'd stfu and would have sent real troops. Had this over in a few days.\n\nSo I'm my opinion, they either don't want us to forget and are trying to cover another news story or a few. (Trump?) Or they have a huge rift where Putin can't directly order the real troops to attack and the person who can won't do it. If the latter then it would be a question of why the fuck then send the reservists?",

The world would be pissed for two news cycles, but then it would just be yet another shitty thing that happened and we would forget about it. Then once the public outcry was gone I doubt many politicians would be able to stomach the cost these sanctions are putting on their own countries, and so those would have to ease up as well. The only reason that's not what is happening this time is that Ukraine is putting up a hell of a lot more fight than anyone predicted. We are getting a chance to see the faces of the people Russia is attacking and really think about it as a present event instead of something terrible that *did* happen but is now over. So now what the Russian leadership thought would just be a footnote on their story of re-expanding to great power status is likely to become the final turning point towards their demise. This was not an inevitable outcome; as I said, history was on Russia's side here. The bravery and ferocity of the Ukrainian people defending their homeland is changing the world.",

Just that the outrage fatigue is real.  Sure, some topics remain the focus of the general public for longer than others, but it seems we hardly ever actually keep the focus and outcry going until a resolution has been reached.  We'll occasionally get an update piece in the news, go \"Oh yeah, it's about time something happened!\", and then it's back out of mind shortly after.\n\nI wouldn't call it hysteria, or say that we'll \"get over it\".

The West will eventually accept that Russia will hold large parts of Ukraine. The West will make Russia bleed for it for years (sanctions as well as supporting Ukrainian independence fighters) but everything Russia did in the past 10 years seems to have been focused on the long run.\n\nRussia's priority list probably goes like this (top to bottom from highest to lowest priority):\n\n\\- keep Crimea (cos gas)  \n\\- annex/control Donbass (cos oil)  \n\\- annex/control Kherson oblast (water supply for Crimea)  \n\\- annex/control Zaporizhzhia oblast (land connection between Donbass and Kherson/Crimea)  \n\\- annex/control everything east of the dnieper river (serves as easily defendable natural border)  \n\\- annex/control all of Ukraine's coastal region effectively making it a landlocked country (force Ukrainian dependence on either EU or Russia)  \n\\- annex/control transnistria (secures ukraine from NATO to the south via dnister river)  \n\\- annex/control all of moldova (bonus: secures Ukraine/Moldova to the south via prut river)  \n\\- annex/control all of Ukraine (narrows potential attack paths for NATO) - this may have been on the table at first but I don't think Russia sees this as an attainable goal anymore\n\nIf you look at Russia's paths of attack you'll see that they pretty much follow these priorities. They are attacking all of eastern Ukraine and the black sea coastal regions which fits all priorities except for controlling all of Ukraine. This was supposed to be achieved by taking Kiev fast I suppose. They failed. Now they will probably try to contain Kiev or try to capture/kill the Ukrainian leadership to secure all their other wargoals.\n\nUkraine will be unhappy about Russia controlling large parts of their country but as they will join the EU/NATO it will become the EU's/NATO's problem that the EU/NATO can't and therefore don't want to fix.

            "text": "Everything Putin said he would do for 10 years he is doing. Even last week he said he would do this. He has been saying over and over again that he wants threat of mutually assured destruction. He has been quite upfront telling us it‚Äôs the only way for Russia to get back to leverage it lost after the Cold War. It is the only way to get a security deal. But it‚Äôs not coming this way. So this is going to be very messy for a long time for the world\n\n\nWhat is disconcerting is if he has been honest up until this point, which he has, in the sense of what he has historically said they would do in order to get a deal, he has also said for several years they are investing heavily in new technology. And that they have some. Hypersonic missile and who knows what else. On the small small possibility this is true, and he thinks he has some military upper hand, he will try to bait NATO into starting or joining a war. And then demonstrate that technology in order to get that security deal. I don‚Äôt believe there will be a nuclear holocaust or World War III. But Putin, I believe, would start World War III. Not completely faded to the end. I need to get a security deal.\n\nI mean was he really frightened that NATO was going to shoot some missiles and destroy his country one day? No. Was he really afraid of a nuclear threat? No. He has said it himself. Mutually assured destruction is a good peacemaker. Nobody is going to actually push the button. So part of me wonders if what he is really terrified, what is really a ‚Äúthreat to his country‚Äôs national security‚Äù is the west coming in and influencing Ukraine and Ukraine doing well. Because if Ukraine becomes a successful country and its people have better, have a good life and a better life, Russian people will literally trample over Putin to get rid of him in favor of democracy. The existential threat for Putin is not bombs and NATO. The existential threat is western success and Russia wanting to topple dictatorship in order to have a better life and a piece of the pie. And everyone deserves a better life. Is he really scared of us trying to obliterate them militarily? No. He‚Äôs tired of being held under the threat of sanctions. He‚Äôs tired of the idea of sanctions. But he‚Äôs terrified that Ukraine will join Europe and continue the slow falling dominoes of dictators falling in democracies ruling.\n\n\nBecause even if Putin were a great dictator and the Chinese president were great dictators - the problem with dictatorships is you don‚Äôt wait four or eight years until a new person comes in to run your life. You have to wait until they die and then go to bloody battles in order to get the next person who is installed for life. No stability. You would think with social media and the spread of information, more than ever people want to stay in their government and choices and what their people have and what their people do.\n\n\nSo already put in his body himself at least some time. Because it will take Ukraine quite a while even if the war ended today. But he stated it himself in so many words. This is not about Ukraine. This is doing whatever it takes ‚Äì even nuclear threats and the beginning of World War III - to get a new deal and security guarantees.\n\nSo he will do this slowly and tell his people say we have told them they had a chance for peace. And then he will either manufacture or provoke a situation which escalates. And then he will escalate and escalate until he thinks the world will cave-in and give him some deal. But who is going to make a deal with a gun to their head? Unless of course you‚Äôre going to give up something really spectacular yourself. Saying I‚Äôm starting this work give me what I want I‚Äôll stop is not going to happen. Period.  So what does Russia even have to offer if we were to sit down and negotiate? And I really don‚Äôt know of anything. What concessions could they make? And if they did how could you even trust them after this?\n\n\nIt‚Äôs going to be a difficult few years I believe. And I hope to goodness I am absolutely wrong",
