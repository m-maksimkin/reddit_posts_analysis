Their bodies were left on the road in an identical fashion to those turning up outside of Kiev. \n\nTogether with other confirmed incidents of Ukrainian war crimes, a pattern is beginning to develop demanding additional investigation. Instead, the Western media and Western governments are obstructing investigations and rushing to conclusions and condemnation. \n\nMe: I wonder if those pow are the same one they feed at the beginning and every mainstream medias parade all over their network.\n\nHere is a shocking debunk by a Ex US marine.
