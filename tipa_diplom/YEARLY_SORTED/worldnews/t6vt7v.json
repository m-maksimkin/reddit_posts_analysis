It’s the only way to get back leverage lost after the Cold War. He has specifically said so. The west should be given a heads up that there is a possibility Putin is going to provoke America and NATO into firing a shot so he is justified taking out the nukes and pointing them. Then he will have those Cold War tensions that he has been talking about. I think the west should be warned and even tell the Russian people that this is where we are heading. Appeal to the humanity of the Russian people. We shouldn’t go 40 years backwards in one week   \n\n\nLook how he has been saying for over 10 years like this video clip in five years. I want mutually assured destruction. It’s the only way to get back on average we lost.  Look how they even in the first week start mentioning nukes and World War III. And look how difficult a country like Korea with nukes is to deal with? Putin is willing to risk it all and even destroy the lives of his people for another 10 or 15 years if it helps get china and Russia some leverage back. And they’re playing the long game. They figure in the long run it’s worth it. Which I disagree with. But it’s not about Ukraine\n\nFor Putin it’s a long game with his people’s livelihood. As it’s always been with communists.  \n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqD8lIdIMRo&t=115s  \n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/cuban-missile-crisis-bring-russia-putin-190221190858809.html  \n\nAnd the next step is to do more provoke above things. Like yesterday shooting at a nuclear reactor. Like getting those he has surrounded our politicians with to start whispering that we should go to war. The next step is changing public opinion.\n\nAnd already Trump suddenly is calling this the holocaust and Lindsey Graham is saying let’s assassinate Putin. Who is telling these people these things? And who told the people whispering in your ear-and who paid them?\n\nPutin has stated he wants to make another Cuban missile crisis event happen and to set up a cold war.
