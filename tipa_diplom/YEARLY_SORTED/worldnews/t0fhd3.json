He seemed so good...\n\nWe can have an honest, disagreeing conversation re: how to approach the status of Lugansk/Crimea/Donetsk within Ukraine (always within the context of UKR democracy, constitution, and legal process - as they are regions within UKR)  -  but **support for any war/violence is crossing a red line.** I'm so glad other Russians are resisting. I wish my old friend would have been there among them, not that I ever would want him to get hurt - but at some level, Russians need to take responsibility for their country's actions & overthrow Putin (even if Putin is a dictator, his state is built out of millions of individuals which make daily choices to continue his regime). Ukrainians successfully revolted against the Berkut & Yanukovic w near-impossible odds back in 2014... when will the Russians do the same?\n\nPutin =/= all Russians, but fuck this war... we need to see mass civil disobedience soon or an overthrow. I am under no misconceptions that these things are easy or come without enormous sacrifice (especially compared w anyone living the N.American experience)... but the sacrifices Ukrainians have made are inhumanly tragic.

I read Reddit for long time but things you are writing here are so absourd im going to write my first comment.\n\nI live in Moscow and just came back from Pushkinskaya square which was the most crowded place in city today. After participating in numerous protests in past 8 years I would describe crowd that came today as very weak, coward and extremely small for war protest. Previously we protesters had strong leadership in Navalny, Nemtsov and some others. All of them were not wide popular amongst people but still they were able to manage protests. Now all possible leaders are in jail, dead, abroad etc... as long as really brave people who visited protests to stand hard and defend each other, not to run away when someone starts running away. There are no brave people anymore. Now what we have is about 20k bravest people in Moscow who are street protesters but not brave enough even to chant \"no to war\" (neither am i), who just stand and watch some unlucky guys or girls with \"no to war\" posters getting arrested. But still we are bravest 0.1% of Moscow population who came out today.  Most of other are just Facebook and Instagram protesters. Everyone in my IG posting stories against war . If Moscow people who posted instagram story against war today would come out, there would be 5-10 mln crowd, not 20k - and definitely we would be much more brave and maybe even achieve something with this protest. Unfortunately posting stories is best russians can. Everyone posting about feeling shame instead of real street protesting. And if you want call someone brave it should be everyone but russians. We just sucked. \n\nStill hope next protest will involve much more people, but there is a very little chance we do not suck again. I really hope that new sanctions from other countries will stop Putin. We CAN NOT STOP HIM. We try it for many years and now street protest is weaker than ever.",

Hang heavy blankets around windows and doors. \n\nPack vital items into a go-bag and make sure you know where it is at all times.

Use them as little as possible for now.\n\nKeep some flashlights and batteries in a bag or box easily accessible. \n\nKnow which of your neighbours you can trust and what skills they may have so you can help eachother. \n\nYou can often trade liquor and cigarettes for other valuable things you may need - if you have any, reserve them in case you need them. \n\nIf there is something valuable that you cannot take with you but must protect, bury it. \n\nKeep your head down, do not draw attention to yourself. If you must do anything that may look suspicious, act like normal & move with confidence. Most people will not question someone who is purposefully doing a task and not acting suspicious. \n\nGet to Slovakia, Poland, or Romania.

So there's not enough space or resources to arrest and hold 3-4% of the population. What are you going to do, just shoot them? Say hello to +10% more resistance then.\n\nAnd Russia, like most countries, has less than 0.5% of its population as police (and military is bad at policing and otherwise occupied at the moment), so if 4% of the population is protesting, they're outnumbered 10:1.\n\nIt takes less than you think... and not all of those people even need to be out and about, that would includes strikes etc. too.\n\nPart of the reason sanctions can work too is by motivating people in an area to push those protesting numbers up into that unstoppable wave territory.",

Most of them are busy trying to survive and better their lives just like all of us.\n\nOver the last couple years I‚Äôve started watching travel vlogs and through recommendations I‚Äôve come across numerous Russian YouTubers, or westerners living in Russia and Ukraine. I‚Äôve seen more speak up about this on Reddit and at least a couple on YouTube and one in particular that i would like to link but i feel like he‚Äôs a really good person and I‚Äôm afraid to link his channel because of all the negativity I‚Äôve seen online towards Russians. It hurts them and I‚Äôll be honest it hurts me to see how much it hurts them because i have a heart, and know it shouldn‚Äôt be that way. It‚Äôs sad and i feel for them. They‚Äôre people too and unfortunately they‚Äôre born into situations and under government that they have little to no control of that sometimes negatively reflects on them.\n\nSeriously, for those willing to look outside your sphere of influence, watch a film like happy people. Babushkas of Chernobyl. Watch NFKRZ on YouTube. He may not represent all Russians but his demeanor, ‚Äúwesterness‚Äù and point of view on things might surprise you and he has some entertaining content. He actually posted a video today related to this which kinda nudged me to post this honestly because i feel for these people. Russians have been through a lot of shit. There are people from all walks of life, maybe some things you might not agree with, but if you can put some of that aside it can be eye opening. Check out Russia Plus, Survival Russia. Maybe even kreosan or super sus- kinda like Russian Jackass(some of kreosans stuff is played up for the camera i think but still interesting, theyve done excursions to pripyat for example, pretty interesting). Most of them speak English or have english subtitles available.\n\nSometimes I feel like with how connected the world is, we still have a very narrow or limited understanding of each other. I know i do but i find thing‚Äôs like this interesting. How people live, their culture, history, traditions and nature. A lot of us really are more alike and could relate to more than what we might think, with some exceptions of course.\n\nFor the Russians reading this not everyone things negatively of you.",

She thinks her town in Russia is going to get attacked at any day. \n\nMany Russians despise Putin. When they protest about anything against the government, they see mass arrests. These protests are amazing but sadly they may not be able to do much inside their own country. \n\nMeanwhile, I have friends in Ukraine who have had to evacuate to Poland while some of their friends and family are still stuck back home, in fear, not knowing what to do. \n\nThis entire ego trip Putin has is putting innocent lives in jeopardy but he doesn‚Äôt care. The dude used to be a KGP spy if I‚Äôm not mistaken. He‚Äôs been planning this for too long.\n\nI think Putin will not stop until he rebuilds the Soviet Union. Sanctions won‚Äôt do shit because there have always been sanctions against Russia. \n\nIf Ukraine falls to Russia, I think Maldova will probably be next. \n\nMy prayers go out to the innocent civilians who are protesting and those Ukrainians who just want to live freely.",
