Civilians, businesses, and so many more people are going to be involved and not just governments and military. And the US is charging the way, especially in these expensive and dumb times. \n\nWe already see these affects on this war, people will hack into other peoples security systems to make them weaker, Elon Musk activated satellite internet over Ukraine for civilians, and celebrities and civilians will send their own weapons and ammunition‚Äôs and money. This is no longer a government/military war, and it never will be. This is a humanitarian war. And the US is leading the charge no matter the president or economy or country. Even if means that the US will be nuked to death, they‚Äôll make sure the enemy suffer equally as bad if not worse. \n\nBut, think of all the possibilities. If we could somehow get our hackers to breach a security or government system in another country, and launch their own nukes at themselves (and possibly multiple countries at a time) we can get rid of major countries in a war that will threaten not just us, but major allies. We could also maybe jam their security system so disable their anti-missile systems, and loads more opportunities as a majority of countries operate their security on networks; I mean it‚Äôs 2022 people come on. \n\nNow, of course, other countries might try to do the same to us, which is why strategy is always part of the game. We could maybe set up bait websites to make them think that it‚Äôs a government website, but it‚Äôs actually a website that injects code into their system and jams them. Or, just a fake website in general which buys us more time.\n\nStrategy will always be the name of the game, more than artillery, fire power, man power, medical aid, protection, advantage, so on and so forth. You need to think of it as a game of chess and what‚Äôs more likely than something else; but always keeping that ‚Äúless likely‚Äù option in the back of you mind and at the ready.
