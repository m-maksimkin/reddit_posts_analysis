Look at america, about the only thing we have left is technology which china probably stole and reverse engineered most of it already. Any future tech will be small considering the limited resources we will have after this coupled with a recession and famine the likes we have never seen.  So russia is telling the world they have to pick their sides. Companies can leave and they can just be replaced in that part of the world.  Or they can stay.

So if they don't change Russian actions, leaving Russia might not be that profitable anymore.\n\nSo if they lose the option of going back to Russia, which they probably want to do in a few years after the war is almost forgotten, it might be pretty bad for them.\n\nAnd getting new competitors, which might be better in some ways, mostly because they won't benefit the owners, but mostly the workers, this might draw away a lot of people from American companies to Russian ones, so American companies are forced to improve their wages and working conditions...\n\nJust a bit of speculation.",

Exactly how a company can make money when dealing with the dead cat ruble is an open question.

The only way we could get paid was to accept tons of tar sands, engage a broker to accept those tar sands, and sell them for real money. It worked. I suppose McDonald's could start accepting tar sands for its food (if it could distinguish its food from the tar sands) but it would be damn inconvenient for Russian customers to have to take a wheelbarrow of tar sands down to their local McDonald's to pay for a Whopper.",
