Which EV’s are about the only way you will survive the coming gas prices with biden shutting down all local oil production.  china holds manufacturing and precious metals, rare earth metals, ect.  Look at america, about the only thing we have left is technology which china probably stole and reverse engineered most of it already. Any future tech will be small considering the limited resources we will have after this coupled with a recession and famine the likes we have never seen.  So russia is telling the world they have to pick their sides. Companies can leave and they can just be replaced in that part of the world.  Or they can stay.  But they have to pick. 10 years means these companies foothold will be gone.  Its not like russia cant rebuild them or simply hire people to run these vacant buildings.

Exactly how a company can make money when dealing with the dead cat ruble is an open question. Shortly after the collapse of the Soviet Union, a company I worked for was contracted to design, manufacture and install and then commission a control system for a Russian steel mill. The only way we could get paid was to accept tons of tar sands, engage a broker to accept those tar sands, and sell them for real money. It worked. I suppose McDonald's could start accepting tar sands for its food (if it could distinguish its food from the tar sands) but it would be damn inconvenient for Russian customers to have to take a wheelbarrow of tar sands down to their local McDonald's to pay for a Whopper.",

Common sense tells me its miss direction what is going on in the background that we are not paying attention too ? We all can see what is in front of us and I’m not parts of ok with bombing innocent civilians my country taught me that with weapons testing in the Middle East . And the way international media portrays this is actually super racist . This type of war dose not happen in a civilized nation um last I checked the middle eastern people are still people . I don’t support the whole jihad but that is taught from a young age Europe has been at war long before the states were created so finding the reason behind all this. There really is no clear answer I can see here if anyone want to clarify or put me in my place by all means I have no argument just questions . The Who what and why .\n\nEdit also I don’t understand the no fly zone the US is supplying weapons hardcore so isn’t that already an act of war what’s the difference if we supply weapons to help Ukrainian we are still helping them , so put birds in the air and let them defend themselves from the sky.
