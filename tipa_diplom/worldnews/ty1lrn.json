The real problem is domestic investors buying up everything and renting/reselling it.\n\n [92% of new housing in Canada gets bought by investors](https://betterdwelling.com/canadian-cities-have-seen-up-to-90-of-new-real-estate-supply-scooped-by-investors/), of that new housing about [10% is bought by foreign nationals](https://betterdwelling.com/foreign-buyers-own-1-in-10-recently-built-condos-in-canada-1-in-20-homes-in-total/), and in total foreign nationals own about 4-5% of housing real estate (This has been dropping for a while now by the way.). This means 82% of new housing is being bought by rich Canadians, not foreign investors, almost always for the sake of reselling or renting.\n\nThis issue is perfectly shown in how common assignment sales are these days (For anyone who doesn't know an assignment sale is just the term for buying something like a condo while it's being built and selling it to someone else before it's finished being built.), it's pretty uncommon for new condos to not go through assignment, the most I've seen is a condo being resold 7 times before the building was even ready to move in.\n\nSo why will this new ban affect nothing? After all, isn't 10% of new housing being available to people better than nothing? Well my answer to that is: What do you think is going to happen to that 10% of housing that normally gets bought by foreign nationals? (I'm aware it won't be the full 10%, but lets keep it simple.) Do you think: The rich Canadians who bought the other 82% are just going to ignore it and be happy with what they have? or do you think they'll swoop in and buy it all to pad their coffers even more? Pretty easy answer here, and once they buy that 10% they'll resell it and run up the price making it just as unaffordable for anyone looking for a home as it was before the ban.\n\nThis ban is nothing more than a thinly veiled scapegoat building off a mix of ignorance, xenophobia, and racism that's far more common place in modern Canadian society than most people would care to admit.

Full-time means an employment position that requires no fewer than 30 hours of paid work per week over a 12-month period and no fewer than a total of 1,560 hours of paid work over that period.\n\n\r  \nTo qualify for a rebate, the foreign national must exclusively hold the property, or hold the property exclusively with his or her spouse. The property must also have been occupied as the foreign national’s (and if applicable his or her spouse’s) principal residence for the duration of the period that begins within 60 days after the date of the purchase or acquisition.",
