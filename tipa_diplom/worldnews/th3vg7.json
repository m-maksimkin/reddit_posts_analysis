How on earth, in this day and age, do you have one of the world's largest, and supposedly well-equipped militaries sitting in a stagnant convoy entering a city for weeks on end? Literally miles of tanks, transport vehicles, resupply, and artillery for miles and miles, just not moving for some reason, and not able to enter its objective destination after storming through all it's nation's border towns and small cities? All the while, aircraft and ground artillery is pounding all kinds of indiscriminate targets, knocking out infrastructure, power, and supply routes- you would think it wouldn't be too difficult to roll on in to the capital with all that equipment. What, do they have the world's most impenetrable road-block, like in the history of human kind? Never in the long, horrific history of warfare have I ever heard of sch a thing- an immobile convoy, consisting of the entire military practically,  and therefore the majority of the battles would have to be waged guerrilla-style, with small factions of soldiers using small-arms, going block to block gunfighting, while actual artillery in use is way far away or laser guided missiles from remote locations. Here is what no one seems to be talking about- military service is mandatory for all male Russian citizens between the ages of like 18 and 26 approx. Every man must serve a minimum of I believe 3 years (could be 2, could be 4) in the armed forces. So you have what is tantamount to a draft as far as the type of soldiers you have fighting, and many are not going to be willing to take part in this indiscriminate blood-bath. We have to remember that many Ukrainians are ethnic Russians, and not long ago, they were all part of the USSR! There are distant relatives, friends and family. That's why we are hearing of snipers taking out innocent civilians in bread lines, because those who are willing to go in and fight, are few and far between, have no discipline or oversight, are fighting for pure blood-lust, and are bitter all the way around- at the Kremlin for putting them in this mess, at their fellow comrades for what they believe is \"pussing-out\", and at the West from all the years of anti-American indoctrination leading to this point. They just want to kill some shit. All the while Vlad is trying to maintain some type of control but he knows it's lost, and for the first time in his tenure, he doesn’t have the biggest country on earth by the balls. The animals are out of the cage, and shit ain't going according to plan. To the outside, Putin is firing those close to him who he feels are to blame, but behind the curtains, this MF is killing his top commanders, advisors, and housemaids left and right in a paranoid frenzy of distrust. Constantly looking over his shoulder for the knife destined for his back. Can Putin fire a nuke all on his own, or is there a layer of security like most reasonable nuclear nations would have, a firewall requiring at least 2 people with launch codes? Probably not, this fool probably has a big, red switch next to the shitter just in case. Either way, once all the oligarchs are against him- his goose is cooked.",
