Why should they fight alongside an oppressive Ukrainian government when they are being oppressed too? Therefore, they can no longer trust anything but Putin's quick victory. He is now seen by the international and domestic media as a terrorist aggressor because he is standing up to his own oppressed people and going against America. NATO is now on hold because Ukraine is not a NATO member. But let us not forget that Russia has sided with China and Iran. Russia alone would bullshit NATO. But together with China and Iran, it would also sweep America. So now it has given the world a lesson. Now everyone is waiting, while Russia is threatened with international sanctions. But it's no good to get China riled up either, because that would have incredible economic consequences. Now they've given the Russians checkmate, but the Russians have actually given them checkmate. Right now NATO is more afraid than the Russians. It is a shame for America to interfere. It always shows up when it has an economic interest. See Kuwait, Iraq, Afghanistan, or in its time Vietnam or Korea. Now they have to defend Ukraine. America is already bleeding to death.",

In Donbass they have been killing Russians for years and making it impossible for them to live. The minority is ignored. See Ukrainian language law. Practically human rights are completely undermined by a country in Europe who legally write their own minority. All this with America, the home of democracy, knowing full well. Hungarians are persecuted in the same way as Russians. Many have emigrated, but there are still 200,000 of our fellow Hungarians living there. The Ukrainian government had eight years to settle the minority issue peacefully. It has failed. Putin has had enough. He stands by his own people, regardless of which side of the border they live. For him, the Russians in Donbas are like the Szeklers in Transylvania for us. The difference is that he stands up for them. So now the Hungarians of Transcarpathia can only trust Putin. Unfortunately, there is nothing to expect from politicians in the mainland.Putin is extremely popular. If, God forbid, Putin falls, the aggressive Ukrainian government will wipe minorities off the map for good. That is why they are confident that he will win. Ukraine does not want Hungarians. Unfortunately, here in the stoned country, they don't need them again. It is the same situation as in Romania. The Romanian calls the Szekler a bozgor. And the Hungarian here calls the Szekler a Romanian. Thus, the Hungarians who have broken away have been left to fend for themselves everywhere. Sadly, the people of Transcarpathia are now looking to a foreign power for salvation. And that is Putin. They are not afraid of the Russians, and they are not afraid of the bombing of Ungv√°r or Mukachevo. They are afraid of their own government and of forced repression.kurucPista",
