    "[META] Loaded questions that are not exactly soapboxing but have premises that cannot be verified by a historian.\nFirst, I want to express my gratitude to the team moderating this sub - we can all agree that your work and attitude makes r/askhistorians undoubtedly the best place on Reddit.\n\nThis being said, I have a “meta” concern that does not seem to have been addressed in the rules but makes me feel uneasy. This post is my way to draw attention to this issue:\n\nTwo of the most popular recent posts on the subreddit seem to have what I would call a dubious premise:\n\nTopic 1: [How did tracksuits (especially the ones with stripes on their sides) become an inherent part of Russian/East Slavic culture?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/ndpx06/how_did_tracksuits_especially_the_ones_with/)\nTopic 2: [Why didn't most people in Muslim-majority countries grow detached from religion like they often did in Christian-majority countries?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/nj60qb/why_didnt_most_people_in_muslimmajority_countries/)\n\nWhile I understand that I am not a source, the premise of Topic 1 seems very difficult to substantiate. How does OP know that Adidas is “inherent part” of Slavic culture? This question seems to be based on a popular meme that pokes fun at stereotypes about Eastern Europeans. The question in practice fails to see the difference between stereotypes, culture and current social facts. Frankly, suggesting that this stereotype is anything but an internet joke making fun of an old fashion trend felt unpleasantly dismissive.\n\nOf course the very educated answers in the thread focused on why the Adidas apparel brand was popular in the 90s - which is a fair approach to the history of that brand in Eastern Europe. At first I expected answers to mention the fact that the stereotype stated by OP as the “truth” may be faulty, but then I realised that people who answer may not be qualified to comment on or even spot the dubious premise. \n\nThe reason is that the premise is not historical but cultural or sociological. A historian is not expected to know the current cultural background of a country or a region, or a group of people. The question is historical but the premise is current. So historians, being focused on history, cannot say whether the premise is true or false. They just identify the topic and tell its history. \n\nTo give a more sinister example: OP may have asked why rape is a part of the culture of nation X. A historian has no way to tell whether rape currently plays any role in the culture of nation X but can tell what is the history of rape in that country. A historian is rarely equipped (nor is he expected to) to discuss the harmful stereotype portrayed as true in current popular discourse.\n\nOf course, when discussing tracksuits, the topic is lighthearted and fun, so no harm done - just raised eyebrows. When religion is involved, however, the stereotypes pushed in the premises of questions may be more troublesome\n\nTopic 2 - which is currently this sub’s top post - is much more worrying, as it reinforces what seems to be a harmful stereotype that the Muslim world is more religious and - as a result - as certain orange politicians would have you believe, not as “advanced”. It suggests that OP has collected data on religious attitudes and various group affiliations in the immensely huge “Muslim” world and reached the conclusion that Tunisians, for example, are more religious than Chileans. It is a premise that cannot be verified and just reinforces a stereotype. I know, again, that I am not a source but I know quite a lot of people from Muslim communities all over the world. None of them is overtly “religious”, while most are unabashed atheists. So a question I would ask in the subreddit would be “What made Muslim communities so atheistic compared to Orthodox Christian communities, which in my subjective experience, are extremely religious?”. I have no way of knowing how rampant atheism is in Muslim-majority countries - so my hypothetical question is as valid as today’s top thread in the sub. \n\nAs with the Adidas question, I do not expect actual historians to be in a position to refute the premise raised by OP. A historian is best equipped to identify the topic (development of religious attitudes in Muslim-majority countries through history) and write about this. A historian has no way of comparing current religious attitudes between, for example, Azerbaijan and Mongolia.\n\nMy point here is that some questions can reinforce harmful stereotypes - even if the asker and the replying historians have the best of intentions. While this is not exactly soapboxing, as there is no malicious intent, it is still a troubling issue.\n\nI am not sure how it can be addressed but I feel that it may pose serious problems to the sub down the road.\n\nThis is from me -hope this helps. \n\nTo the mods - keep up the good work, thank you very much for your work! To everybody else - keep giving those great questions and answers!": [

Thank you thank you thank you.\n\nI used to be a big fan of this sub, then these \"tell me why large numbers of people do X\" questions kept popping up, usually becoming popular because the premise fed into some pre-existing stereotype among the readers and experts.\n\nWhatever period of time you're an expert in, if somebody asks you a \"Why did people do/not-do X?\" your answer should be to refuse the question. Turns out people are not all the same, but academic consensus is. The most appropriate answer should be along the lines of \"I can't answer that, here are some examples that support your premise, here are some that refute it. In all honesty we don't know. As for the person who actually made decision Y, they public said this one thing, while we have close sources that say something a bit different ... (yadda yadda)...\"\n\nBut that's not the way humans work. Instead, historians, like every other profession, go through phases where one reason for public perception triumphs over another one, then a new generation comes in, somebody writes a paper or provocative book, and everybody flips around. There's no shame in that, it's actually probably very healthy in the long-term, but it tends to lead people into talking out of their butt.\n\nThese kinds of questions can't be answered in the way requested for things that happened last week, much less a hundred+ years ago. As much as this is red meat for those already primed to repeat how much they're caught up on the latest opinion, it's okay not to be able to answer something. In a way, this is the historian version of breaking the 20-year-rule. You're not answering a question about something that happened in the last 20 years, you're answering a question about how current academic opinion has solidified around a topic in the last 20 years. It's the same thing, only meta.\n\nWhich leads me to my last request: I'd like to see more \"history of history\" questions.  How did academic opinion of the later crusades change from the mid 19th century through the end of the 20th? What are the various reason military history might be on the wane and has it gone through cycles? How did the job of historian develop from Herodotus through the early 20th century? These kinds of questions might be considered meta-meta, but for folks interested in history they show a field that's not afraid of looking at itself with a critical eye. That's probably a much healthier intellectual environment than simply taking all comers and insisting that replies have lots of sources. Lots of folks have lots of sources. There's a patina of priesthood here that's not attractive for some readers. (Also, by and large, this kind of thing doesn't happen. I exaggerate in order to make a point. I still find this forum most interesting. Please keep up the good work! It's just not perfect and you guys can do better.)",

While Christianity in South America and Africa does complicate the narrative a bit, and while younger and more internet-savvy generations in the Muslim World are more secular than their parents, the observation that Muslim countries tend to be more religious than \"Christian\" ones is broadly speaking a well supported statement, as is the statement that Muslim majority nations tend to be underdeveloped by first world standards. I'm not including a source for this because this is honestly one of the few times where \"just google it\" feels valid, given the amount of study that's went into this and that it isn't an even remotely controversial statement among Sociologists (what would be controversial however is suggesting that the West is more developed because it's Christian, which some would argue but is a point of view that I strongly oppose).",

A historian can't *not* know culture - historians *deal in* culture, *breathe* culture, and on this subreddit, *explain* culture. Hell, one of our Actual Capital-H Historians published a book entitled *Classical Greek Tactics: A* ***Cultural*** *History*. And the answers in the tracksuit thread did indeed touch on culture, most of them pointing out that it's specifically a *gopnik* thing.\n\nSo I really don't know where you're coming from with 'not historical but cultural or sociological' - indeed, we have eighteen flaired users who have 'culture' outright in their flair titles, and others go even more specific. Would \"Irish Food History\" not touch on culture? Would \"Medieval Law\" not touch on culture? What of \"Eunuchs and Castrati | Opera\", \"British Regimental System\", \"18th-19th Century Society & Dress | Queenship\", \"Dueling\", \"African Literature\", \"Musicology\", \"Vajrayana Buddhism\" - are these *not* culture?\n\nIt's going to take a while, but you can be assured that any answer that we let through for the \"why no secular Muslim countries\" thread will deal with the premise, should the answerer find it faulty.\n\nAnd because it's my flair area - [you're far from the first to have this concern.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a1tcjs/meta_loaded_questions_leading_questions_and_false/)",

            "text": "I understand where OP is coming from about dubious premises, and I would inject three critiques of his analysis. First, any historian responding to these questions is equipped to raise the question “what evidence do you have that this is actually representative of Eastern Europeans as a whole?” And then segue to answering why and how—based on pop cultural representations of Eastern Europeans in film etc—this came to be a dominant stereotype or narrative. \n\nSecondly, though we in pluralist cultures often have a laudably reflexive aversion to stereotypes which is clearly well-intentioned, stereotypes aren’t always untrue or unfounded. I recall reading once in Thomas Sowell’s *Intellectuals and Society* that disharmonious relations between German-American and recently immigrated Irish-American communities in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries was attributable partly to German stereotypes about Irish immigrants relating to their propensity to alcoholism, the frequency of cholera outbreaks in Irish neighborhoods, and a whole lot of others. Mean-spirited and prejudicial though it may have been, these stereotypes were rooted in facts. Irish-American immigrant neighborhoods ***were*** more likely to have higher incidences of alcoholism and cholera outbreaks. Now, we could have a robust discussion about why that was, and why American culture—due to nativism, anti-Catholicism etc—was less conducive to the assimilation of Irish-American immigrants, but the fact remains that the stereotype wasn’t all wrong. \n\nFrom *Intellectuals and Society*:\n> Cholera, for example, was unknown in America until large numbers of Irish immigrants arrived in the nineteenth century, and cholera outbreaks in New York and Philadelphia went largely through Irish neighborhoods. People who did not want to live near Irish immigrants, as a result of diseases, violence and other social pathology rampant in the Irish communities of that era, cannot be automatically dismissed as blinded by prejudice or deceived by stereotypes. Strenuous efforts, especially by the Catholic Church, to change the behavior patterns within Irish American communities, suggest that it was not all a matter of other people’s “perceptions” or “stereotypes.” Moreover, these efforts within Irish American communities ultimately paid off, as barriers against the Irish, epitomized by employers’ signs that said “No Irish Need Apply,” faded away over the generations.\n\nThirdly, why Islamic countries have not fallen into the pattern of secularization which has characterized nominally confessional Jewish and Christian communities throughout the Western Hemisphere is a worthwhile question. As to whether we can substantiate the religiosity of peoples in different parts of the world, and compare it to others, we can with polling data. While I’m not knowledgeable enough to verify the quoted comparison of Chileans vs Tunisians (according to my linked source, Tunisians *are* more religious than Chileans, incidentally), I can with a Google search verify that lots of collected data would support the conclusion that people in the Middle East for example, are more religious than people in Europe. \n\nhttps://www.pewforum.org/2018/06/13/how-religious-commitment-varies-by-country-among-people-of-all-ages/\n\nAs for why the Muslim world tends to be more religious I’d venture to guess that because there are fewer distinctions between secular and religious spheres (and depending upon the level of observance imposed by certain governments—or whether the regime in question is expressly theocratic or not—in Muslim countries, there is sometimes virtually no distinction at all) in Islamic theology would go a long way to explaining why that has been a slower process in Muslim countries. Muslim jurists double as clerics as well, so all this points to a kind of cultural order which resists secularizing trends more strongly than in Western, or other non-Muslim countries. That said, in many elite circles (versus at a small town or village level) in these countries, like Jordan, for example, you often finds lots of people are more or less religiously lapsed and more secular. So status influences often the level of observance vs secularization.\n\nThis recent source indicates that the Islamic world is in the midst of a new secularization:\n\nhttps://m.dw.com/en/middle-east-are-people-losing-their-religion/a-56442163\n\nSo, the Muslim world is catching up with the West. One key finding is that Muslims are disassociating religious faith from religiously ordered societies and calling for reform, which theocratic regimes in Iran and Saudi Arabia are becoming alarmed by. When you couple this with the fact that Islam is still the fastest growing religion in the world perhaps reformed theological schools will be ascendant; perhaps traditionally raised Muslims will eclipse today’s reform-minded Muslims.

It’s part of the reason this sub is so popular because history affects all of us. \n\nPeople who want to know more about history have their own biases, preconceptions, prejudices ; but their subjective experience has generated a curiosity that they want to verify. \n\nIt doesn’t matter if the questions that people ask offend you, or reinforce stereotypes - they are still a valid method of engaging history from a perspective that is perhaps the only one available to them. \n\nYou have no call to gatekeep approaches to history.",
