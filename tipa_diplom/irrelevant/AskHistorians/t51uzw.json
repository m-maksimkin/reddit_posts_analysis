    "My Grandfather who was an NYPD detective in the 50s, 60s and 70s used to drunkenly brag, that sometimes suspects would be killed and their bodies were dumped into the East River. Are there any actual cases or reports of the police doing anything like that, or is my G. Father just a crazy drunk?\nclarification Grandpa is dead, also correction he actually served in late 40s through the early 60s. Also he implied other police were complicit in this, and it related to the crime they were investigating.": [
