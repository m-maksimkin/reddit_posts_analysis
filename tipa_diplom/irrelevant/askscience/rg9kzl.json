The genetic differences between wildcats and domestic cats are much less than dogs and wolves.  \n\nCats return to their wild form more easily because the genetic mutations that differentiate the breeds are narrower.\n\nIn theory, If you could un-breed dogs in the same way, you'd get something that looks like a wolf.

For example desert environments favor a tawny or otherwise brown coat and slender body and tundra will favor white or gray and stockier body.\n\nThe most obvious example i can think of are dingos. They are actually a distant offshoot of early domesticated dogs. After a few thousand years of adaptation, they have returned to a uniform tawny coat and lean, swift body type. This is the form that consistently performed best over a few thousand years. It was enough to ensure that all modern dingos have a \"base\" type.\n\nEnvironmental stresses play a role too. In indiscriminate populations that have a fairly low risk of predation and dont completely rely on their own ability to hunt, theres less pressure to adapt an ideal form to ensure their success.\n\nA basic urban dog is probably going to look much more diverse than a basic purely wild dog like the dingo. You'd probably have a medium sized animal with short hair and a return to a more typical dog's shape but the colors might vary quite a bit.",
