    "AskScience AMA Series: We've discovered that pancreatic cancer is detectable based on microbes in stool, with the potential for earlier screening in the future. AUA!\nHi Reddit! We are Ece Kartal (u/psecekartal), Sebastian Schmidt (u/TSBSchm) and Esther Molina-Montes (u/memmontes). We are lead authors on a recently published study showing that non-invasive (and early) detection of pancreatic cancer may be possible using stool samples. Ask Us Anything!\n\nPancreatic cancer is a horrible disease: although few people develop this form of cancer, only around 1 in 20 patients survive for 5 years or longer after diagnosis. This is in part due to late detection: symptoms are unspecific and often occur only when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages, so that diagnosis if often too late for therapeutic intervention (surgery and/or chemotherapy). This makes the earlier detection of pancreatic cancer an important goal in mitigating the disease, yet no approved non-invasive or minimally invasive, inexpensive tests currently exist.\n\nWe studied a Spanish population of patients diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC, the most common form of pancreatic cancer) and clinically matched controls that were either pancreas-healthy or suffered from chronic pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas, an important risk factor for the development for PDAC). We found that a set of 27 microbial species detected in feces provide a very specific signature for PDAC patients, even in early stages. When combined with a blood serum-based cancer progression (not diagnostic) marker, prediction accuracy increased even further. We confirmed this finding in an independent German cohort, and also made sure that this microbiome signature did not falsely predict PDAC among thousands of subjects that were either healthy or suffered from other diseases. Moreover, we were able to trace some of these signature microbes between mouth, pancreatic healthy tissue, pancreatic tumors, and the gut which suggests that they may be more than just indicators.\n\nOur study is freely available online in the journal GUT (Kartal, Schmidt, Molina-Montes, et al; 2022): https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/01/26/gutjnl-2021-324755\n\nA commentary by R. Newsome and C. Jobin in the same issue puts our work into context: https://gut.bmj.com/content/early/2022/02/21/gutjnl-2021-326710\n\nFor less formal introductions, check the press releases by one of our funding bodies ([Worldwide Cancer Research](https://www.worldwidecancerresearch.org/news-opinion/2022/march/microorganisms-in-stool-samples-could-offer-new-way-to-detect-pancreatic-cancer-early/)) or the lead institutions [EMBL Heidelberg, Germany](https://www.embl.org/news/science/an-international-study-proposes-stool-analysis-for-early-detection-of-pancreatic-cancer/) and [CNIO Madrid, Spain (text in Spanish)]( https://www.cnio.es/noticias/una-colaboracion-internacional-propone-un-analisis-de-heces-para-la-deteccion-temprana-del-cancer-de-pancreas/).\n\nOur work is an early proof of principle and will need to be further validated on larger and independent cohorts. Yet our findings hold some promise for a future inexpensive, non-invasive screening method for pancreatic cancer. Such a screen could initially target risk groups, e.g. above a certain age or with a family history of PDAC. Ideally, with further development and in combination with other biomarkers, our approach might be developed into an actionable diagnosis method in the future. That said, none of us is a medical doctor; we cannot and will not provide any medical advice, and none of what we post here should be construed as such.\n\nWe will be on at Noon Eastern (16 UT), and are looking forward to your questions, AUA!\n\nWho we are:\n\n+ Dr. Ece Kartal (u/psecekartal, Twitter: [@ps_ecekartal](https://twitter.com/ps_ecekartal)) is a former PhD student at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, Germany and currently a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Heidelberg.\n+ Dr. (Thomas) Sebastian Schmidt (u/TSBSchm, Twitter: [@TSBSchm](https://twitter.com/TSBSchm)) is a research scientist at the EMBL in Heidelberg.\n+ Dr. Esther Molina-Montes (u/memmontes) is a former postdoctoral researcher at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center (CNIO) in Madrid, Spain and currently an Assistant Professor at the University of Granada, Spain.": [

One thing that several people have asked already is about **timing**: when would a possible screening test for PDAC become available for patients?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is very difficult to make a prediction on this, unfortunately. Our work is early and proves principle that such a test should be feasible. However, to get this out of the academic lab and into practice, several things need to happen:\n\n* **Validation**. This is the most important point for now. We describe a microbiome signature that worked in a well-characterised and clinically matched, yet relatively small population of Spanish patients. We validated it in a likewise small-ish German PDAC population. We further made sure that this 'signature' is PDAC-specific (i.e., does not raise a 'false alarm' in healthy people or patients with other diseases) by validating it against thousands of publicly available datasets. Yet more work will be required, on larger and geographically distinct cohorts, to establish how robust this is at scale.\n* **Development.** In our study, we used shotgun metagenomics - meaning that we 'randomly' sequenced the DNA of all microbes in a stool sample to then explore which ones are predictive. This would be impractical to do as a test and would also cost $$$. Now that we know more specifically what to look for, the next step is to develop a more targeted test for only the species that *are* predictive. Such a test will be much cheaper and has to be easy-to-use for people who are not trained physicians or microbiologists. This has been shown to be possible for other diseases (e.g., colorectal cancer), but the translation will certainly take time.\n* **Certification and Approval.** Obviously, *if* we have a working test, it will also have to be approved by the relevant agencies before it can be used by patients.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt is also important to note that all of the above costs $$$ and cannot really be done by academic labs alone. So we are working with clinicians in different places, but also with diagnostics companies to get this rolling. It is difficult to estimate how long all of this will take, but if all goes well (and as cautious scientists we have to say: that's a big *IF*), a screening test could hit shelves in 5 years or so.",

How long do you predict it could take to be approved for the general population?\n\nAre you aware of any current similar studies that could interact with yours?\n\nI lost my mom to... well... chemo (more specifically renal failure due to chemo), but my mom was one of the \"lucky\" ones whose cancer started in her pancreatic duct and happened to cause pancreatitis. They were able to do a whipple procedure, found she was only in stage 2b, and were able to remove all of it; her margins were 0! Unfortunately, her oncologist missed the fact that she apparently had cirrhosis, and he was also unwilling to adjust her chemo dosage/schedule due to the fact that there's almost no data on patients whose pancreatic cancer was caught early and has been completely removed - he blasted her like a patient in stage 4. My parents felt weird about it and almost stopped a couple treatments from the end, and my dad was obviously crushed that he didn't take that route.\n\nAnyway, I have 3 other friends who have also lost their moms to pancreatic cancer since I lost mine (one lost hers just 2 months after mine, so we were going through it at the same time). I'm fairly paranoid about it these days, but am so relieved to read this news today!!",

I commend you all for working on this devastating cancer—and I say this because there are plenty of “money maker” malignancies out there that affect more individuals than does pancreas cancer. This disease is devastating and well deserving of some good news/options. Makes sense to focus on early detection, since “early detection” now a days still does not always mean early enough. I think I know about 3 patients who survived >5 years out of dozens and dozens. As an oncology nurse this is my “any other cancer, please” diagnosis.",

And by consume I don't just mean food, I would include anything else that people ingest. \n\nThese are probably stupid questions, lol but I was just curious on this point. Also acidity vs alkalinity, I recall back in the day a lot of claims that an acidic body pH is conducive for cancer to thrive. How much merit do you think that has? Could that be true? or is it true?
