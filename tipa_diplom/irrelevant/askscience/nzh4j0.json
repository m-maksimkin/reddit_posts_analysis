It can quite easily emerge on any \"alive\" planet - any that has volcanic activity and a set of chemicals, that are able to produce organic molecules.\n\nPrimitive life on Earth had emerged quite early, and didn't change much for billions of years. Until a very rare event happened. Once a cell got into another cell, but wasn't eaten, but became a partner. This endosymbiosis event had solved a huge threshold (related to energy consumption) that was limiting the cells from becoming more complex.\n\nSo, this very rare event took billions of years, and then during about 0.5 billion years the life has exploded in diversity and complexity, which led to conscious organisms that are able to contact other planets.\n\nSo, if what happened on Earth is universal (and the books I've read convinced me that it is), almost any planet that has liquid water and volcanic activity, has primitive life forms. But the absolute majority of those planets have only primitive life forms. And only a tiny fraction of them have life that managed to solve the \"rare event\" problem and started consuming more energy and evolving further.\n\nBut as soon as that \"rare event\" happens, there's not much that can stop life from producing intelligent species like humans. But the event is so rare, that makes intelligent life is also rare.\n\nBut another thing here us that as soon as life gets intelligent, the evolution gets so rapid, so it just gets almost instantly teleported into some final form, that doesn't care about contacting others at all. They are just too wise and have things to do.\n\nSo, to simplify: first life takes billions years to get to multicellular life. Then about 1/2 billion years to get to the conscious life. Then conscious life takes maybe 100K-1M years to get so much beyond, to become something that we won't even consider as a life. And this tiny time period of 1M years per planet would happen for any planet that has life potential. And these moments have a tiny chance to coincide on the timeline of the universe while being close to each other in space. That's why we don't have many contacts.",

Humans have arguably had the ability to detect and recognize such a signal for only the last 0.01% of the most recent million years.  And it is even arguable now whether we have that ability.  Right now we have the capability to monitor only a tiny percentage of stars for signals.  \n\nIn addition, though physical travel is nearly impossible over the insanely huge distances involved, it is important to think about the experience of such aliens had they dropped by Earth every million years for the last billion years.  Life remained mostly small and microscopic until about 580 million years ago, when complex multicellular life arose, developed over time, and culminated in the Cambrian Explosion about 541 million years ago.

We assume these beings would have something akin to a biological body, with a \"tip\" for a head and means of movement like legs and so on. We assume their means of travel would abide to our CURRENT understanding of means of travel ie. propulsion and that their understanding of physics would be the same as ours, when ours changes constantly.\n\nOther forms of life could take the form of [bionic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bionics) systems, the symbiosis of digital and biological parts that would be indistinguishable from each other. Current human evolution seems to be taking a [transhumanist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhumanism) trend, sci-fi stuff like \"enhancements\" and so on, for example for a species studying us, our cellphones could very well be considered an extension of ourselves, giving us the vast knowledge of the internet in seconds. Now imagine a complete symbiosis with this knowledge database, via say [Brain-machine interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface), giving this person immediate access to all human knowledge seamlessly.\n\nThis stuff sounds like sci-fi but it's all progress that could be adapted in less than a decade for humans.\n\nMost of our search for life elsewhere assumes life conditions being the same as here on Earth (understandably, we can't search for complete random conditions for the sake of it). It is assumed other lifeforms should be carbon-based, but we know [biochemistry can theoretically take other forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothetical_types_of_biochemistry) and depend on other solvents besides water.

There are advancements in so-called [Strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) and [artificial consciousness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_consciousness), so this \"life\" could even be non-biological (so called \"[non-cellular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cellular_life)\") or non-corporeal for that matter. (By non-corporeal meaning not interacting with our percieved dimensions of spacetime, an old philosophical concept called \"[Non-physical entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-physical_entity)\")\n\nGoing back to the original question, in my opinion it's a big naive assumption to think these lifeforms would transport their biological forms (if they have one) in conventional looking crafts via fuel-based propulsion and we could \"interact\" with them as if interacting with a smart animal.",

That's just the nearest star to us, Proxima Centauri. There are approximately 100-400 billion stars in our galaxy.\n\nYou know how it takes you ~10-14 hours to fly from one end of the earth to the opposite side in a commercial jet airliner? If you flew to the sun at that speed, it would take you 21 years. Light, the upper limit of how fast things can go, takes ~8 minutes, and \"running\" around the earth at that speed would let you encircle our planet ~7.5 times **each second**. That's roughly how fast electromagnetic radiation (for example, radio waves) travel through vacuum of space.\n\n[Here's a picture of how far human radio signals have traveled over the last 100 years.](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/02/27/article-0-11EF84AB000005DC-804_1024x615_large.jpg) From center of that dot, to the edge.\n\nTaking this into consideration, think about the logistics of the space travel and communication:\n\n- You need to know where to go. Mapping planets is extremely difficult, as they are very small and produce no light of their own. Identifying which planets can support life, possibly without terraforming (which is also a process that could take decades) is like trying to figure out whether an apple on a table 2 miles away is edible or rotten while you're wearing a blindfold. But let's assume the aliens are just so damn advanced, they mapped the whole galaxy for planets. They now have to...\n\n- Produce a colony ship/an Ark that can travel for millions of years self sufficiently, effectively creating a space habitat, that can travel at, let's say, 1% the speed of light (that's ~2,990 km per SECOND) and doesn't get blasted to smithereens after any potential collisions with small, undetectable celestial bodies. We can assume that a sufficiently advanced AI will be able to permanently monitor the direction of travel and automatically slow down then adjust the course of the Ark if it notices a planetoid on a collision course. But an asteroid the size of a city or smaller? It likely wont obstruct enough stellar background for any AI to notice (and space is very dark, so you wont just conventionally see it), while slowing down from/adjusting course at 2,990 km/s in a vacuum of space is challenging to say the least. But let's say all the above are solved with the ingenuity of science and technology. We're finally hitting the last step of the problem...\n\n- The people. Assuming the aliums are space elves and live 10,000 years each, assuming 1M years travel time, that's still 100 generations between the start of the journey and the end. Communications between the colony ark and the point of origin are pretty much out of the question - at a mid point in the journey, it takes 5,000 years for a message to travel one way from the ark to their planet alone. So you have people living and dying on this ark, for 100 generations, each of them living ten thousand years, all having to be educated, indoctrinated and somehow controlled to maintain the mission. Unless they're of a gestalt consciousness that transcends spacetime, or have zero capacity for rebellion and self expression, this likely wont end well long term. So the only option is cryogenics which allow you to freeze your colonists for one million years before they reach their destination.\n\nI think recent human history, Hollywood and games seriously skewed people's idea of just how ridiculously hard the above would be in reality. It's not impossible, but that's a lot of technological hurdles and unknown variables to overcome. It's similar when talking about structures like Dyson Sphere. Talking about them requires taking a gigantic leap of faith that involves the logistics of the whole operation, but when you think about gathering and transporting materials alone, it starts feeling quite silly. \n\nAlso, it all needs to pay off - any civilization advanced enough to produce this level of tech likely also has some degree of economy and whoever builds the ark needs both funds and a reason to undertake such colossal task. Even if you assume an idealistic space empire or an absurdly rich and powerful technocrat, that's yet another hurdle in this endeavor. \n\nNow, you could simply wave your hand and say \"they probably would have warp/wormhole travel/instant teleportation tech by then\", but at this stage it's just making things up and anything goes.\n\nEdit: a typo and numbers correction",

The galaxy is only about 100,000 light years across, so even at 1% of the speed of light, it takes 10 million years to cross the galaxy. We evolved from small mammals to tool-using humans with space rockets over less than 100 million years. The invention of writing to the Apollo Program is maybe 10,000 years or less. All of these time-scales are much shorter than the age of the Earth, let alone the universe. This means that if life intelligent evolved anywhere else within the galaxy, it's unlikely that it appeared at the same time as us - it's almost certain that any intelligent life would be millions of years more advanced or millions of years less advanced.\n\nThis tells us that galaxy-colonising advanced life must be rare, as if there is intelligent life that has the capability and intent to colonise the galaxy, anywhere within the galaxy, anywhere in the past X million or billion years, they should have reached Earth a very long time ago.\n\nOf course, there are multiple reasons why galaxy-colonising advanced life might be rare.\n\n- they lack the intent, i.e. they could colonise the galaxy, but they choose not to leave their home planet, or they do explore the galaxy but leave us alone (basically the Zoo hypothesis)\n\n- they lack the ability, i.e. even with millions of years of advancement it's not practical to leave a solar system in mass migrations, or a more advanced society generally becomes more at risk of destroying itself before it reaches that stage (\"the great filter\")\n\n- *intelligent* life is rare. Life has thrived on Earth for billions of years before one species developed spaceflight. Evolution doesn't inevitably lead towards developing life that can invent advanced technology. There may be many planets out there full of animals and plants, or even just bacteria, but it's possible that humanity is a bit of a freak accident.\n\n- life is rare in general. We don't really know how common life is. We know the ingredients seem to be fairly abundant, but how often do these combine to make something we would reasonably call \"life\"?\n\n- the conditions for life are rare. However, as we discover more and more exoplanets, it looks like there are quite a few planets that seem like they would be hospitable to life, so this is less of a factor than we used to think.\n\nSo this isn't really a \"paradox\" in the common sense, because there are many ways to resolve it. But each of the resolutions involves stuff we just don't know - we don't know how frequently life evolves in the right conditions, we don't know how frequently life evolves to form intelligent space-faring species, and we don't know how often a space-faring space faring species would have the intent and capability to explore the galaxy.

The key is that \"rare\" is relative.\n\n*How* rare?\n\nSo, we know we don't live in a universe where every single planet has advanced civilizations on it because we live near many planets already and only one of them comes even close to showing signs of intelligent life (ha ha little joke there).\n\nBeyond that we have to start making some assumptions.  One is that intelligent civilizations will at some point in their history use radio signals to communicate.  That's not nearly as certain an assumption as what we know about our own star system but it's still probably a pretty good assumption.\n\nAs long as we accept that assumption, then the scope of our definition of \"rare\" can expand greatly, for the simple reason that if intelligent civilizations use radio, as you say, we should have at least heard something.\n\nBy the way, the chance of someone contacting us, specifically, as an intentional effort is actually pretty low ... the outward signs of our existence have not propagated more than 100 light years or so at the absolute most, which means 50 light years is our best round-trip case for return communication, and we know of only a thousand or so star systems in that range.\n\nSo, from that we can conclude that there aren't radio-using intelligent civilizations right now on every star system, just as we already know that there aren't on every single planet.  But beyond that we can't conclude much.  What if they existed in the past but are gone?  And there's always that other question -- what if they don't use radio?\n\nBut beyond that, a thousand-something stars isn't much in the grand scheme of things.  The whole rest of the vast universe hasn't had a chance to hear from us yet, let alone reply.  So now things get tricky.  Way out in the rest of our galaxy, in the 1000s or 10,000s light year range, what is going on right now?\n\nWe have no idea.\n\nThere could be intelligent life popping up and starting to use radio all over our galaxy right now and we would have no idea.   There could be a new civilization sending its first radio broadcasts every year.  We won't have any idea for many millennia to come.  Effectively, those civilizations may as well not exist.  We will never come into contact with them.\n\nSo that gives an idea of how rare is \"rare\" when it comes to intelligent life -- we can actually say with certainty that it is pretty damned rare, but not necessarily unique in all the universe since our ability to estimate with any degree of precision only goes out so far.\n\n(We can try to make more guesses, based on stuff like the fact that we aren't today hearing from any ancient civilizations from 10,000 years ago, but then we really start running into the limits of our assumptions about radio and the age of civilizations and so on.)\n\nTL; DR  We already know that intelligent life is super rare.
