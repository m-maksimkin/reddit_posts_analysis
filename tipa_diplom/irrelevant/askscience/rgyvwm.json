In general, enzymes are phosphorylated in the FASTING state. Many cells and enzymes are extremely active in the FASTING state such as adipose cells and liver cells that have the exclusive job for maintaining blood sugar/energy levels; however, the general trend is that cells are lacking ATP in the FASTING state and therefore are just waiting for some energy molecules to phosphorylate their enzymes to get the engine going again.",

Glucose for metabolism 2.) too many toxic byproducts of metabolism 3.) not enough neurotransmitters available 4.) not enough time to rest (the cells need to ‘recover’ after firing) but in reality all of this will be happening in tandem. eg. uve been playing chess all day you've been activating more neurons and faster and longer :) [note: if you use a group of cells more, then more resources will be allocated to them and they will grow in number to divide that labour. So playing chess after 3 months will feel easier]\n\nA liver metabolizing alcohol all day will get tired and that is reflected by breakdown of cells and accumulation of toxins. Its difficult to carry over this definition from the subjective realm of *feeling tired* into that of biology. But its a great question! When we get tired we rest but actually we *could* work more. Cells and organs just do what they must with the resources they have to keep things in an acceptable range. If not, they can get more resources (eg. body adapts by pumping more blood), switch to another pool of resources (eg. aerobic to anaerobic in muscles) and finally get damaged (eg. hypoxia) and die ... evolution has provided cells with a 'self-destruct' sequence if it comes to this and they can't fulfill their function. \n\nSo, to recap: The whole body is tightly regulated to divert resources as appropriate (the circadian rhythm, as u/turingading mentioned). The resources are too many to enumerate, but the most important is oxygen and glucose, which gets converted to ATP. The cells use this and when we run out of glucose, we can use our fatty acids or muscle breakdown product for ATP and this is another of those pathway switches that can keep the cells going. \n\nΕdited for clarity purposes",

            "text": "Interesting question: if you ask me tired/fatigue is a feeling of your physical state. So a cell doesn't \"know\" when it's \"exhausted\".\n\nHonestly, cells are just hyper-complex biochemical nano-machines that fulfill their purpose through chains of chemical reactions. But, like all machines, a lot of them wear out. The most common wear-out is DNA damage from replication; DNA replication isn't perfect (it happens astoundingly fast and errors are bound to happen. Try copying a document by typing as fast as you can but you can't backspace.) We do have mechanisms to detect these mismatches, but some slip through the cracks. This can be harmless, but if the error somehow shuts down a regulatory protein for cell division, or hyper-activates the same protein then we have problems. Fortunately, we have different checkpoints to prevent this if a cell gets too \"hyper\". If any of these checkpoints are triggered, the cell is essentially programmed to kill itself (also some forms of physical damage to the cell also trigger a similar pathway).\n\nWe do have some cells that don't replicate and are essentially \"immortal\" as long as they get energy. These are usually our skeletal muscles, cardiac muscles, and neurons. These can become \"tired\" in the sense that we feel fatigue; but on the cellular scale this is just buildup or metabolic waste and depletion of necessary molecules for function (e.g. myocyte fatigue is from depletion of ATP and Ca++; neuronal fatigue is the buildup of adenosine - which we have receptors in our brain to tell us that we're tired; caffeine blocks these receptors giving us a feeling of wakefulness).\n\nAs for antibodies, they are just a glob of protein that floats through the blood. They're highly specific, as in one antibody per one pathogen (e.g. a Covid antibody will only tag covid; a flu antibody will only tag the flu). These proteins help tag the pathogen so the immune cells can find them and do their job.",

When those rules are broken, you can get benign tumors or in the worst case cancer.\n\nThere's another situation where cells \"wear out\" after dividing many times. The system that copies our DNA loses a small chunk at each end of each chromosome every time. There is some unimportant DNA put onto the ends, but when that is used up, you start to lose important DNA. Those cells then become senescent (worn out). That \"protective\" DNA at the ends can only be built in certain special cells, like in the embryo (so an individual starts with \"fully charged\" cells).",

Caffeine, for example, makes you feel awake by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain (adenosine usually makes you sleepy). You've probably heard of melatonin used as a sleep aid -- it usually signals to the brain that it's nighttime.\n\nNow, if we're asking if cells feel sleepy in this way, the answer is no -- cells aren't conscious. They do, however, have very regular cycles, like our night-day cycles, of growth, activity, and \"rest,\" but there's no central sensor in a cell like the brain. (\"Sensing\" in this case is much more distributed).\n\n(2) On the other hand, you could be referring to what I'd call fatigue -- e.g. when your muscles become weak from use. As others have said, this is caused by buildup in the blood of waste products generated by aerobic respiration, the process by which the body generates energy from oxygen and carbon molecules (think sugar, protein, etc.).\n\nAn analogous situation in a cell would be situations like hypoxia (low oxygen), which could be caused by something like ischemia (lack of blood flow to an area). The cell has indirect ways to sense lack of oxygen, which, if triggered, will lead to either cellular adaptation to the low oxygen or, more commonly, cell death (called apoptosis) if oxygen is low enough. The cell can also sense when its energy sources (like ATP) are low and will take similar action. \n\nThere are all sorts of ways that cells can \"feel their age,\" too -- like telomere shortening, oxidative damage, etc. -- but that's another discussion entirely.\n\nSource: I'm a cell biologist/biochemist specialized in apoptosis (cell death) and a neuroscientist.",
