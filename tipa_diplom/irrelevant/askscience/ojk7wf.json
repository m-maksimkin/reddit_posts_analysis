Equally, we are not able to discern tiny gaps so it must be a discernible change in elevation. I'm going to take 1cm as a statistically significant elevation.\n\nThe earth is knobbly, and I can't predict your starting point so I'm going to say that the distance we're looking for is when, on average, your feet are 1cm or more from the ground for an extended period.\n\nI'm also assuming that you're staying on land for this thought experiment as going off a cliff into the sea would mess up these calculations a bit.\n\nInformation on the average smoothness of the earth's surface is hard to obtain. I was unable to find any studies which did anything more than plot the maximum and minimum elevation. As a result, I will be using data on elevation change from runners.\n\nAs far as I could tell, runners consider 100ft of elevation gain per mile to be a fairly steep hill. As most runners run in settled areas, which tend to be flat, I'll take 100ft to be a very rough average. It's probably a bit low but you're also probably starting from a settled area.\n\n100ft per mile is enormously more than the curvature of the earth for the first few miles. That's about a 2% gradient. Unfortunately, we don't know which direction that is, but if we assume that you are pointing downhill, an average of 2% would mean you go 50cm before your feet are 1cm off the ground.\n\nAccounting for angle means finding the average apparent slope at any angle, which means multiplying by 1/pi, or multiplying the distance by pi.

If you define the threshold to be small enough, you're already \"not\" touching the ground the moment you move a single step forward in this scenario (which presumably assumes a perfectly smooth Earth, not one with hills and valleys.  If you take into account hills and valleys the answer would be different depending on the terrain.)\n\nThen there's the question of how big your feet are and are you allowed to flex them to conform to terrain or do you assume they are rigid and fixed in shape (unlike a human foot made of meat actually would be)?  Because some parts of your foot are a few inches away from other parts of your foot so technically the answer isn't even the same for the entire foot.  Just like the fake idealized world that's perfectly smooth, you \\*also\\* have to assume a fake idealized foot that's a single point in space and doesn't cover an area like a real foot does.\n\nEssentially, the question is phrased the wrong way because technically you are a teeeny distance off the ground the instant you move at all tangent to the surface.  If the question was rephrased with a threshold distance then you could give a reasonable answer.  If that threshold distance is big enough then you can ignore all these other ugly problems about terrain and foot size etc as being too small to matter at that scale.  e.g.  \"How far would I have to walk forward to end up being 20 kilometers off the ground?\" would be a good way to phrase it.  If you throw in \"assuming a perfectly smooth earth\" to get rid of terrain issues then you could get by with a smaller threshold and still get a reasonable answer at that scale, like 'how far to end up 1 meter off the ground\".",

Note that if I start walking at the foot of a mountain (assuming the mountain qualifies as part of \"Earth's surface\"), then this walking path may actually *interfere* with \"Earth's surface.\"\n\nIn seeking a definition of \"Earth's surface,\" we notice that the Earth is not perfectly smooth, so even if one ignores/subtracts out \"the curvature of the Earth,\" there is still the \"roughness\" of the Earth to account for, i.e., mountains, valleys, and every other type of topographical feature that exists in between.\n\nOne could attempt to survey the topographical features comprising Earth's \"roughness\" and model them as a probability distribution (perhaps involving a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)) to a seemingly arbitrary level of accuracy, and declare victory.\n\nBut that approach creates a new problem! [What counts as a \"topographical feature\"?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastline_paradox) If my linear path aligns with a tree, does the tree count as \"the ground\"? If not, then how do I know when to categorize objects as \"the ground\" and when not to? How do I characterize \"the ground\" at positions near the base of the tree, in order to evaluate whether it is touching? If the ground is assumed to simply not exist near the base of the tree, then where does that boundary begin and end? (Etc.)\n\nAlso what exactly counts as \"touching\"? Having subtracted out Earth's curvature, I am now walking on a perfectly flat, mathematically-derived plane, and evaluating whether \"the ground\" touches my feet or not. Presumably, this means we're super-imposing a phantom, intangible version of Earth's surface over my walking path and evaluating whether that envelope counts as \"touching\" my feet or not. How close does it have to be to qualify as touching? Does the entire footprint need to be touching, or just one small point? If the latter, how small is small enough? The tip of a blade of grass? (Etc.)\n\nThe common theme is that at some point, you have to define resolutions for the boundary envelopes, and the answer you get will strongly depend on those input assumptions.",
