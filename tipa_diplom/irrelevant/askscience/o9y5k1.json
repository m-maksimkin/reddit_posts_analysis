If you get rid of the anxiety though and let the brain continue adapting, you're not going to be depressed any more. You'll be less thoughtful but more present in the moment. But if you get rid of your anxiety, by working out or having intercourse or medicating, then by not having anxiety you would be happy. Not cured though, until over time your thoughts arise in response to more comfortable emotions due to more comfortable circumstances. With a repetition that involves an emotional pallette containing a greater degree of comfort, the brain will flip up its visor and start to see the coast is clear.

Also, the best natural treatment for depression is exercise, which is really unfortunate, since it’s about the last thing you wanna do when you’re depressed. Relieving the chemical imbalance in whatever way possible, whether that is through medication or diet and exercise, once you’re at homeostasis, the brain can heal. We know for sure that it stops any further damage. It’s really important for people with illnesses like schizophrenia to stay on their meds because it is a degenerative condition when uncontrolled.",

            "text": "Long term, recurring, or chronic depressive episodes have shown a decreased production in several neuromodulators. You may be familiar with the most commonly noted: Dopamine and Serotonin.\n\nThe decreased production of these chemicals are attributed to the lowering of inhibitive responses, spatial awareness, navigation, consolidation of short term to long term memory, problem solving, metabolic symptoms, and difficulty thinking clearly or at all. Most notably regarding memory loss or difficulty with information recall, this is directly connected with Hippocampal atrophy, or a shrinkage of the hippocampal nuclei. However, it is unlikely this alone will be responsible for permanent loss of memories as the hippocampal nuclei, whilst directly connected to consolidation of short to long term memories, does not appear to store long-term memories after the fact.\n\nHenry Gustav Molaison was a seizure suffering patient in the 1940s(?), around the time doctors first learned you could remove parts of the brain to help reduce seizures in sufferers without gravely impacting neighbouring regions. His Hippocampus was removed to this end, which proved successful. However, he was rendered incapable of creating new long-term memories because of this procedure, but maintained previous memories.\n\nAtop this, the primary reason for one's lack of interest in hobbies and such is due to the impact on the substantia nigra, which is a mass of dopaminergic cells believed to play an important role in reward and movement, which further corroborates the sluggish movement, coordination, etc, as all limbic sub-systems are effected, too. Given my current knowledge, limited as it may be, I also suspect chronic depression has a direct affiliation with limited glial efficacy and potentially even an indirect cause of demyelination within the brain. I'm only maybe a month into my studies at the moment, so excuse any outdated or inaccurate information.",

Essentially making people that are depressed age faster than those that typically aren't. The study also shows that anti-depressents do decrease all of those markers which is great news. \nCommenting on what others have already said though, the most helpful thing you can do is find a therapist and/or psychiatrist that you can trust and have them help you decide what the best thing is for you. Also, everyone's different and will react to anti-depressents in different ways, but for a large number of people it does help. It helps balance the chemistry out in your brain. Exercise, healthier diets, a bit of trusted and comfortable social interactions will all help tip the scales towards a healthier brain chemistry as well.",

This has been demonstrated by studies in mice, brain imaging and postmortems of depressed patients. Namely these changes are:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. Reduced synapse (connection) formation between neurons\n2. Loss of connections between existing neurons\n3. Reduced formation of new neurons\n4. Atrophy of existing neurons\n\nIn the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The prefrontal cortex is the part of the brain responsible for higher brain functions such as decision making, planning, concentration and personality development. The hippocampus is key in learning and memory, and has connections to the ventral tegmental area which is important in motivation and reward processes.\n\nIn the amygdala, which is responsible for the 'fight or flight' response, research has shown that there is actually an increase in synapse formation between neurons which may explain why anxiety is co-morbid with depression.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere has been research to show that anti-depressants can reverse the changes seen in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The time it takes for anti-depressants to work is in parallel to the time course for the maladaptive neuroplastic changes to be reversed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTLDR; Yes there are bad changes associated with a depressed persons brain, yes antidepressants have been linked with a reversal to some of them.",
