We have other variants since delta but most of these have not caught significant public attention. [This wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2) has a list of the named variants. The latest is Nu, but has since been renamed Omicron. According to [this journalist](https://twitter.com/PaulNuki/status/1464310918389587974), the WHO selected Omicron as the latest variant because Nu and Xi (the next two letters of the Greek alphabet available for new variant names) are too easily confused with other words (Nu = new) or risk stigmatising China (Xi).",
