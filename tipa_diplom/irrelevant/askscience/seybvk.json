    "Oat Milk bad for Reproductive Organs?\nBarista here! \nJust had a customer order a Pumpkin Spice Latte and when I said Oat milk was our nondairy option, he backed away and said “whether you know it or not, oat milk messes with your reproductive organs.” \nI then spelled O-A-T to confirm and said, “well I drink it all day so that’s great” \nHe confirmed oat and walked away.  \nApologies in advance if this isn’t considered a science question.. I just drink a lot of oat milk and have never heard this/would like to know if there’s any grounds for this claim.": [

Soy contains phytoestrogens that may affect hormones in the human body.\n\nMany people believe soy products will boost their estrogen (female hormone) and turn them into females, or somewhere in between.\n\n>There have been only singular reports on modified gender-related behavior or feminization in humans in consequence of soy consumption. In animals, the intake of phytoestrogens was reported to impact fertility, sexual development and behavior. Feminizing effects in humans can be subtle and identifiable only statistically in large populations.\n\nOats also contain phytoestrogen, along with many vegetables and grains, but I dont believe its anywhere near soy.",
