How about bronze or copper? Or titanium cut oats? Or other metals or alloys?  \n\nOats are cut using a granulator or groat cutter that consists of a rotating drum and stationary blades. Oats are pulled in to the drum through vibration or using air and then cut with blades.\n\nSteel is used for the blades because of its durability, hardness, and wear resistance. Other reasons steel is used are that it holds an edge a long time, is easy to sharpen, and is ubiquitous in the cooking and food processing industry.\n\nOAT TYPES\n\nThere are 5 main types of edible oats: oat groats, steel cut oats, rolled oats, quick oats, and oat bran.\n\nOat groats have had the inedible hull removed and are the whole grain with the bran intact so can be used for sprouting.\n\nSteel cut oats are oats that have been cut into pieces.\nSteel cut oats are oat groats that have been cut into pieces. Quick oats have been cut into pieces and rolled. Rolled oats usually are the whole oat goats rolled. \n\nRolled oats and quick oats have been steamed so they have been cooked and can be eaten without further cooking.\n\nBoth quick oats and rolled oats have been steamed so they have been cooked and aren’t technically a raw food. They can be eaten without further cooking and keep for a very long time.\n\nOat bran is the outer layer of the oat groat. It makes you feel full longer and can be eaten raw or cooked (it only takes 2 minutes to cook). It lowers cholesterol and can aid in regulating blood sugar levels by forming gels that slow the absorption of sugar in the intestinal tract. Oat bran is great for making muffins, bread, or baked goods. 1/2 cup of oat bran and an egg or two makes a quick and easy breakfast that will keep you full longer than oatmeal.\n\nOAT MILK\n\nOat milk is super easy to make at home. Put a handful or two of oats in your blender with water and blend for 10 seconds on medium. (Add a few dates if you want to add sweetness). Pour the blended oats through a strainer. Don’t press or push the last of the liquid through as this will make your oat milk slimy. That’s it! \n\nYou can use the remaining strained oats and liquid that didn’t get strained to make a smoothie since your blender is already out being used and then nothing is wasted. Just add banana and/or other smoothie ingredients and some of your freshly made oat milk. A great smoothie recipe uses the remaining oats and liquid and adds banana, peanut/almond butter, and blueberries with fresh oat milk.\n\nBONUS INFO\n\n> Unlike barley which must have it's hull sanded off damaging the seed, an oat groat kernel's outer bran layer is still intact after de-hulling. This somewhat protects the inner nutrients and also permits it to sprout. From this stage of processing, oats are most often rolled. Sometimes they are cut into two to four pieces before rolling and are called 'steel cut rolled oats,' or quick rolled oats. Opening the seed in this way permits oxidation of the inner nutrients causing them to go rancid. Long ago, it was learned if oat groats were steamed first destroying the enzymes that permitted rancidity to happen, the rolled oats could be stored for long periods of time and stay fresh. We've heard more than one story of a family opening up a well stored 25 year old can of rolled oats thinking they'd only be good to feed the chickens. But to their surprise, their rolled oats were still fresh and wholesome after all that time.\n\nEdit: If you are using oat groats for sprouting make sure that you are getting raw oat groats. Oat groats you find in the store may have been steamed (not raw).",

            "text": "In addition to what others have said: Oats are quite a tough grain so they need to be processed in some way before cooking, otherwise they take upwards of an hour to soften.\n\nTo process oats, they are either steel cut, stone ground, or rolled.\n\nThe first two produce oatmeal, rolling produces oat flakes (just flattened grains rather than like e.g. cornflakes)\n\nSteel cut oatmeal is very clean. The oats are literally cut up into small pieces by sharp steel blades, leading to an oatmeal made of very consistently sized pieces with sharply defined edges and a good amount of strength/structure remaining in the grain. It is more expensive to produce because the steel cutting process is much higher maintenance, requiring lots of blade re-sharpening.\n\nStone ground oatmeal is quite dusty. The oats are ground between 2 carefully spaced stone wheels with grooves in them (like old fashioned flour mills). This leads to an oatmeal containing a range of sizes of oat pieces, including quite a lot of dust. The individual pieces have more raged edges and have often been part crushed, leading to less structural integrity. This is a cheap process because the millstones are extremely durable and very low maintenance once installed.\n\nThat's what they are, then the \"quality\" aspect is mostly down to personal taste/preference.\n\nStone ground oats will cook faster than steel cut because the small pieces and dust will thicken up into porridge quicker than the uniform oat chunks.\n\nStone ground oats will produce a softer/less textured porridge.\n\nSteel cut oats cook slower but produce a more textured/nuttier porridge.\n\nIt's very much like \"do you prefer your potatoes boiled, fried, baked etc?\": It doesn't change the underlying quality of the vegetable/nutrition by much, but the preparation costs can have a fairly large affect on the perceived value of the end result.",

            "text": "Cut rather than steamed and flattened have a little more of a complex flavor, slightly more bitter. The real difference is in texture. The gelatinous, almost snotty texture of the more processed oat is nothing like a slow cooked chopped grain.\n\nThe other flavor difference also happens to other grains ( like grits) that have been cooked in milk. The water in the milk evaporates over the long simmer and the resultant \"sauce \" has a higher portion of milk fat and protein. The resultant rich flavor and creamy mouthfeel changes the bowl of oats from a paste that needs all the sugar and spice you can throw at it to a rich filling grain dish that can stand on its own and is a down right treat when served with fresh or frozen berries.\n\nLike jasongetsdown says the best thing to do is cook up a large batch over the weekend and nuke the appropriate portions for a breakfast that takes less than three minutes to put on the table. It can also be frozen for longer storage, but of course takes longer to cook unless you remember to thaw it the night before.",

            "text": "There are 3 styles of oats; steel cut, rolled, and quick oats. Steel cut are close to how people original ate oats, they are coarsely chopped with steel blades. They retain more of the original oat flavor but also take longer to cook. Rolled oats are steamed and then pressed through rollers flattening them. Since they've been essentially par-cooked it only take 5 minutes or so to cook them at home, but the steaming and rolling process means they lose a lot of the original flavor. Then quick oats are rolled oats that go through further processing to cut down on cooking time further so you could pour hot water over them and wait a minute and they're done.\n\nEdit: wow I didn't expect one of my most popular posts on Reddit to be a response about processing oats...thank you fellow nerds for your interest in the esoteric and minutae subjects of the world.\n\nEdit 2: I see a lot of people asking the same question \"does it need to be cut by steel blades? What if it's cut with a different metal?\" The answer is no. The steel cut is just a reference to the process. In this case the word \"steel\" is another word for \"blade\" or \"knife\". In other places it's called \"Irish oats\" because that was the style people of Ireland typical enjoyed and asked for so it became synonymous with the style.",
