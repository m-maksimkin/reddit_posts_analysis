    "ELI5: If math is a such a definite subject with solid answers, how are there still unsolved math problems? How do people even come up with them?\nEdit: y'all have given me a lot to think about. And I mean a lot, especially as someone who has failed more than one math class lmao. I appreciate the thoughtful responses!\n\nEdit 2: damn, I'm glad my offhanded question has sparked such genuine conversation. Thought I'd touch on a sentiment I've seen a lot: tons of people were wondering how I'd come to conclusions that would bring me to ask this question. I'm sure it's not just me, but at least in my experience vis-á-vis the shitty american public education/non math major college, math ain't taught very well. It's taught more as \"you have these different  shaped blocks, and they each have a firmly defined meaning and part of that meaning is what they can do to the other blocks. Therefore we know everything the blocks can do, or can at least theorize it\" and less \"the blocks can be held and put together in infinite ways and be applied to infinite things that have yet to be fully imagined or understood and we're still coming up with new blocks every now and then\". Buuut now I know that thanks to reddit!": [

Math is the study of systems of principles and rules to determine how you can derive true statements from them.\n\nLet's take an example here. We know that there are rational numbers and irrational numbers. Rational numbers can be represented as a ratio of integers (like 3, 0.5, 0.33333..., which can be represented as 3/1, 1/2, and 1/3 respectively). Irrational numbers can't be. You can further assume that those integers cannot have any common factors, because if they do, you can just simplify the ratio. That is, while the rational number 4 can be represented as 32/8, 32 and 8 have 8 as a common factor and we can just divide both by 8 to get 4/1.\n\nIs the square root of 2 rational or irrational? The answer, one way or the other, is a fact. It's a defined solid answer. But you don't know whether the answer is yes or no. How would you figure that out? \n\nThe famous proof that sqrt(2) is irrational goes roughly as follows. Assume sqrt(2) is rational. Therefore, there must exist integers p and q with no common factors such that sqrt(2) = p/q. Let's square both sides of this equation to get 2=p^(2)/q^(2) or 2q^2 = p^(2). Since p^2 equals 2 times something, p^2 must be even, which means p must be even. But if p is even, then p=2k for some k, and p^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^(2), which means p is divisible by 4. Now for q. We have that 2q^(2) = p^(2), so q^2 = p^(2)/2. We have that p=4k for some integer k, so we can write this as q^2 = (4k)^(2)/2 = 16k^(2)/2 = 8k^(2). This tells us that q^2 must be even, because it equals 8 times something. Which means q must be even. \n\nBut now I know that both p and q are even, which means both are divisible by two, and that violates my original assumption that I had sqrt(2) = p/q with no common factors between p and q.\n\nOne of two things has happened here. Either I've made a mistake somewhere in my argument, at which point the entire conclusion is suspect, or else my assumption was invalid from the beginning, and there really can't exist those numbers p and q such that p/q = sqrt(2), making the idea that sqrt(2) is rational provably false. How does anyone know which of the two things has happened here? \n\nThe answer is that math is full of this kind of thing, and the solution is that tons of other mathematicians pore over your arguments trying to find any mistake you might have made. Maybe I was wrong when I said that because p^2 is even, p must be even. Can you convince the rest of the mathematical world that I wasn't allowed to make that leap under the rules of the standard arithmetic system we all use? If so, then we'll all agree that my proof was invalid and we don't in fact know whether sqrt(2) is rational or not yet. But if enough people agree that they can't find any errors, then we all agree that I've solved the problem of determining whether sqrt(2) is rational -- it's not, and I've provided the proof of that fact.\n\nThis is what mathematics really is. It's a bunch of people trying to build arguments to convince other knowledgeable people that they've come up with a way to answer a question that no one really knows the answer to yet.

Not just one or two math problems, but all of them. The idea is that you start with a few base assumptions that you know are true but aren't really provable called axioms. A proof is then built up out of some combination of these axioms. The idea is that you could go through every combination of these axioms to find every possible proof out there and solve everything that can be solved. This concept is called completeness and was embraced by many, if not most, mathematicians.\n\nHowever, as recently as 1931, the mathematician Godel proved that mathematics was not complete. In other words, Godel's incompleteness theorem mathematically proves that you cannot prove everything that is true in mathematics. So not only are there still unsolved math problems, but there will always be unsolved math problems, even with infinite computing power.\n\nOn a related note, soon after that, an impossible math problem was also found. It was proven that you cannot build a program to detect whether a program has an infinite loop in it!",

That's an accurate description of the math that people are taught in school.   \n\n\nHowever, when you are doing math in university (\"real math\", if you will), you understand that the scope of the subject is very different. One thing worth noting - most mathematicians will disagree on what even is a proper definition of mathematics. For what it's worth, I will give you my own definition: math is the process of deriving properties from axioms and definitions. In more ELI5 terms: math is about creating rules and definitions, and seeing what interesting consequences follow from those rules when applied to those definitions.   \n\n\nIf you think about it in these terms, then you can see how open ended the subject is. You can come up with your own definitions or rules, see how they fit in the existing rules or definitions that other people agree upon, and see if using your own stuff creates any interesting results. As an example of this happening in real life - mathematicians used to think that infinity was just an absolute concept. But Cantor showed that if you looked at two different infinite sets and tried to match their items one by one, you could come up with some sets that would have infinitely many \"unmatched\" items left over even after you ran out of items on the other side. So he came up with a definition for two different types of infinity, based on whether you could match items of different sets with one another without running out of items on either side. So then lots of questions crop up - can you find some properties that only one type of infinite sets have, but the other one doesn't?   \n\n\nI hope this gives you a sense of how and why the subject is open ended - mathematicians can come up with interesting new definitions and ideas, and then as they apply existing rules to them there is a whole host of questions that crop up about what general statements can be made.",

It might seem obvious what \"1\" is but we must remember that in all the time that the concept of \"1\" has existed, *most of the time the number 0 had not been conceptualized*.  That point aside, we must now, if we wish to define \"1 + 1\", decide what \"+\" means.  This is called an \"algebra\" and was philosophically pioneered by some brilliant folks quite a while ago.  We *could* create an algebra wherein 1 + 1 = 5, and that's been done before.  But it turns out that it's not very useful.  It turns out that 1 + 1 = 2 is correct only because it *works* and is *proved* to work.\n\nSomething like 50 pages of *Principia Mathematica* (a philosophical treatise) are dedicated just to establishing through logical proof that 1+1=2.

As an example I'll explain the context behind [Hilbert's 13th problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_thirteenth_problem), because it's accessible to anyone with a high-school level of education.\n\nI'm sure you remember from school, learning the quadratic formula to find the roots of equations of the form ax^(2)+bx+c=0. From here, we can ask a harder question - what's the formula for equations of the form ax^(3)+bx^(2)+cx+d=0? This was solved in late medieval Italy, as was the case of the degree 4 (highest exponent is x^(4)) equation. The, for some centuries, it remained an open problem as to the formula for the degree 5 case.\n\nEnter Evariste Galois, a French mathematical genius living in the 1830s. If you think that rock stars live interesting lives, look into Galois - he'll give most of them a run for their money, and he beat the 27 club by most of a decade. Anyway, he invented a field of math called \"abstract algebra\", and used it to prove that there is no formula for degree 5 or larger equations in terms of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and nth roots. An example of such an equation is x^(5)+x+7=0.\n\nSo, how do we find the roots of degree 5 equations? Returning to x^(5)+x+7=0, we can define the [Bring radical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_radical) to be the root of that equation; that is, BR(7)^(5)+BR(7)+7=0, or more generally for any number *a*, BR(*a*)^(5)+BR(*a*)+*a*=0. This is part of a larger class of functions called \"algebraic functions\" - an algebraic function returns the root of a polynomial equation.\n\nIt turns out that degree 6 equations can also be solved using a class of algebraic functions, called [Kampe de Feriet functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kamp%C3%A9_de_F%C3%A9riet_function), which I am not qualified to speak about.\n\nThe problem that I mentioned, Hilbert's 13th, which is still an open problem, is whether degree 7 equations can be solved in terms of algebraic functions of 2 variables. That is, if you know the roots of (say) x^(7)+*a*x+*b*=0 for some *a* and *b*, can you use that to solve any degree 7 equation?",

            "text": "> How do people even come up with them?\n\nA big source of math problems come up in the same way they come up in other sciences: the quest for classification.  In basic biology you classify organisms (KPCOFGS), in basic chemistry you classify the atoms (periodic table and its groupings).\n\nIn math, you have natural mathematical objects that you want to classify.  In fact, every time you're introduced to a new mathematical object, you want to classify them.\n\nOf course, classification is just a beginning (as in the examples biology and chemistry: with classification you can REALLY begin to understand or study the science), but it's a start.\n\nHere's an approachable example:\n\nA \"group\" is a collection of objects where \n\n* each object can interact with each other through \"multiplication\": a * b = some other object in this collection,\n* associativity: (a * b) *c = a* (b * c) .. in other words multiplying a * b, then multiplying the result to c is the same as multiplying a by the product: b * c.\n* there is a special \"identity\" object often denoted \"e\" such that anything multiplied with \"e\" is that thing itself:\na * e = e * a = a\n* every object \"a\" has an \"inverse\" (let's call it \"b\") so that\na * b = b * a = e.\n\nAn example: the set of all non-zero real numbers (complex works as well) is a group where \"multiplication\" is what we usually think of as multiplication.  The identity element in this example is 1.  Note that \"non-zero\" is necessary because 0 has no inverse.\n\nAn example: the set of integers with \"multiplication\" being the usual addition of numbers.  The identity in this example is 0.\n\nAn example: the set of two objects \"a\" and \"b\", where we DEFINE a * b = b, a * a = a, b * a = b, and b * b = a.  The identity in this example is \"a\".  This is the ONLY group that has exactly 2 objects in it.\n\nYou do: find a \"multiplication\" table for a group of 3 elements.  There is only one such group -- classification!\n\nGroups of 4 elements: there are 2 groups of 4 elements -- classification!\n\nThe general version of the classification above you'd probably learn in a 1st semester grad class in Abstract Algebra.\n\nThe power of this is that because a group is so simple, many mathematical \"things\" are groups so classifying them gives you insight into many different fields of math (and other sciences -- group theory is used in chemistry to study crystals.. group theory is also used to find the general solution to the rubix cube).\n\nBy the way, notice that for a group, you DON'T require a * b = b * a!  In fact one of the 4 element groups has elements where this is not satisfied!\n\n*Actual* math that mathematicians do is nothing like what regular people think it is: I personally think every university should offer an Abstract Algebra class as a class to teach logic and introduce non-math people to a different side of math.

Pretty much an infinite amount of things. You can build a plane for example.

Maybe there is a tool that let's you reach an area faster and more efficiently.

They start off by comparing how someone would solve equations, pointing that it has a clear, step by step procedure, and then pointing out that there are Maths problems where there aren't any clear step by step procedure for solving them. The thing is, this isn't obvious at all. And in practice, it's not even true for most problems!\n\nHere's what you can do: get a person (or a machine) to randomly write out letters on paper, so they eventually write down every combination of sentences. Get another person to read what they write, and whenever they write something coherent and sensible —something that starts with things we *know* are true, and only shows that more things are true using sensible deductions—then put those sheets of paper on a stack somewhere (well, okay, there's only so much paper and ink that we can make, and humans aren't immortal, but I digress). The papers in the stack will eventually contain any possible proof for any provable statement. And if you get a third person to read through the stack and put only the ones with a specific conclusion in a second stack, then you can find a specific proof for any specific statement that's provable.\n\nFor example, if you tell the third person to only find proofs with conclusions that \"for all whole numbers n > 2, a^(n) \\+ b^(n) = c^(n) has no whole number solutions for a, b, c,\" then you will eventually get Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem in this second stack. But what happened? There is no ingenuity or creativity in this process; it's tedious, but it seems to be as mentally challenging for each of the three people as solving equations. To put it another way, it's an algorithm, one that even a machine can perform.\n\nThere are four big reasons why doing the above won't help us solve the currently unsolved problems.\n\n1. It's tedious and computationally demanding. There is no garauntee that a short statement will have a short proof (Wiles' proof of Fermat's Last Theorem spans over a hundred pages). We might have to wait for eons, until all the stars in the universe dies of light, before we get anything.\n2. It's not clear what should be \"true\", what should be \"sensible deductions.\" That's completely up to the second person. Right now, most Mathematicians use the \"collection of true things and sensible deductions from them\" known as [ZF(C)-Set Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory). But some disagree on this convention.\n3. It's hard to interpret Maths and use it, for example, to model the world. That's the job of  the third person (or the person asking him what to look for). It's not obvious at all how an inequality (e.g. something like p > q) can say that we can never get perfect information about something, but lo' and behold, that's the [Uncertainty Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle).\n4. It doesn't even work! As others have mentioned, [Godel's Incompleteness Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) shows that there are statements which are *true* but can never be proven (in our formal Mathematical system).",

So it is a pattern that seeks to explain patterns we think we see (it already sounds like a leaky sieve). The power of Math to explain things lie not only with the person applying the Math* but also in what they are observing and how the are observing. Conventional Math is weak when exploring the really small, the really big, the rally fast moving and probably a whole host of other things we have yet to discover. If a people choose not to apply Math to certain things or have yet to observe/discover a thing then that is reflected in the Math. *Ancient peoples mostly sought to describe that they had another child, killed another wolf, harvested another apple; and/or why this particular stitch is the same stitch as another; and/or ways of tying rope for different applications; and/or the fastest way/how to get from the cave to the waterhole; when to leave an area or plant a crop. This is reflected in our Math today. My point is that how Math is applied and what drives our discoveries is dependent on what is important to us, on how/what we think. Math is a reflection of our values, what we think we know and what we see. As our ability to observe and/or our knowledge base increases we come up with new Math to describe the world around us. As our values change how our Math is expressed may also change. Math isn't this bastion of truth, is it limited by the minds who create it, by the environment it seeks to describe and by the society that applies it.",

            "text": "The basic answer: mathematics is hard. And as we answer old questions, new questions come up that need answering. Furthermore, people think of mathematics as being the thing they learn in high school where you have to find x. It's not. It's something far more fundamental, it's about making statements and proving (or disproving) those statements.\n\nSee mathematics as discovering a new world: the more of it you discover, the more you realize there is more and more to this world that you *haven't* discovered. Sometimes you think you're close to some new part of land, only for there to be a huge mountain range in between you that you can't cross, meaning you need to find a whole new route. \n\nSo let's talk about how an unanswered mathematics question comes about. There are many ways this could happen, some questions come from making models for things (population growth, for instance), or they come from physics, or they come from mathematicians just toying around.\n\nThe last one is probably the easiest to give an example of (and there are many of them). Say you're working with prime numbers, and you look at the distances between them. Well 2 to 3 is 1; 3 to 5 is 2; 5 to 7 is 2; 7 to 11 is 4, etc. \n\nYou can then ask yourself some questions: does every (positive) number show up as such a distance? Well clearly not, since no odd number (except 1) will show up, as that would require an even number (except 2) to be prime.\n\nWell what about every even number? Will that show up somewhere as the distance between two consecutive primes? Aaand we have already stumbled upon an unanswered question.\n\nBut let's keep going. We see a lot of 2s show up, at least at the start. Are there infinitely many of those? Another unanswered question (Twin Prime Conjecture, to be exact).\n\nYou can see how easy it is to come up with these questions. Note I used prime numbers here, since they're fairly well-known, and easy to understand. There are also a lot of these questions in other fields of mathematics, of course. Some of these questions are so complicated, on fact, that to just understand the problem, you'd probably need a maths degree.\n\nBut it gets even worse, but to understand this, we first need to get to the foundation of mathematics. Mathematics fundamentally used axioms. These are statements that are so obvious, we just take them to be true. That sounds like cheating! Why do we do that? Well in order to prove something is true, we need to be able to make assumptions that are true. It is impossible to prove something without any prior assumptions.\n\nSo what are these axioms? Well some of the ZF-axioms (the basis for set theory, which in turn is the basis for a lot of mathematics), include things like \"two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements\", or \"you can merge two sets together into a larger* set\".\n\nFrom these axioms, we can then prove things, from which we can prove more things, etc.\n\nHowever, now comes the problem for mathematicians. Gödel proved that, no matter what system or axioms we use, there will be statements that are true, but not provable from these axioms. So there might be statements out there (maybe even some of the unanswered problems of today) that are true, but not *provable*.",

If you see a pattern in nature, like the veins on a leaf or the rough edges of a nation's coastline, you can use math to communicate what you've learned about that pattern to other people.  \n\n\nThat's pretty amazing to communicate the nature of a coastline and the nature of a leaf to people using the same language! It would be called poetry if we used words. But if we use mathematics, we call it fractals. When you see that math is about communicating patterns to each other in a precise way, math can be beautiful and appreciated. I hope that you might give math a second chance and learn to appreciate its beauty sometimes. There are plenty of fun videos on YouTube that teach math in a different and fun way now. Go explore and have fun!",

            "text": "It's worth underscoring what's at the heart of a lot of this discussion: math is actually *not* a definite subject with solid answers. Math is a series of assumptions, and a set of tools you can do to useful things given those assumptions.\n\nSometimes those assumptions leave you with incomplete information. Sometimes they create a situation where you want to do something useful, but it's impossible. And sometimes you can get different answers by changing the assumptions. Worst part is, if you're looking into an unsolved problem, it's often impossible to tell whether you just haven't figured out the solution yet, or it's actually impossible to solve given your assumptions. (This last thing is called \"incompleteness\".)\n\nExample: There's an assumption in geometry called the Parallel Postulate, which basically says that two parallel lines are the same distance apart at all points on the number line.(1) This seems pretty obvious. If you assume this is true, then the sum of the angles of a triangle equals 180 degrees. This is taught in schools all across the world.\n\nBut the Parallel Postulate isn't true on the surface of a sphere. Try it -- take a basketball and draw lines on it with a piece of chalk. All straight lines on a sphere intersect. And it turns out that, if you don't have the Parallel Postulate, then the sum of the angles of a triangle *doesn't* equal 180 degrees. On a sphere, it's always larger than 180 degrees.\n\nGuess what we live on. A giant honking sphere. If you cut a piece of paper into a triangle, and then draw a triangle on the ground with lines the same length, they will have different sized angles! (By a very tiny amount, because your triangle occupies a very tiny fraction of the earth.)\n\n(1) Technically what the parallel line postulate says is that, if you have a line and a point not on the line, there is exactly one line that passes through the point but not through the original line. On a sphere, there are zero.",

            "text": "It's instructive to actually walk through a simple proof to see how it works.\n\nSo you might learn about prime numbers and wonder: How many primes are there? Do they keep showing up as long as there are more numbers (infinite), or do they \"run out\" at some point?\n\nIf you think about this question for a bit, you should be able to convince yourself that it's a good one, i.e., it's \"not obvious\" one way or the other. As you go farther and farther down the number line, it *could* be the case that you finally get to a point where you collect enough primes behind you that you can just make every number going forward.\n\nA parallel example: What scores are impossible in American football? Obviously there's no way to score 1. The amounts you can score are: 2 (safety), 3 (field goal), 6 (touchdown), 7 (touchdown + extra point), and 8 (touchdown + two-point conversion). So are there are scores not possible?\n\nFirst we notice that we don't really need to concern ourselves with all of these values. In fact, every way to directly score, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8, can be narrowed down to just safeties and field goals because we can make 6, 7, and 8 by just adding 2's and 3's. So the real question being asked here is: Is every number a sum of some combination of 2's and 3's? It turns out that, yes, you can sum 2's and 3's to any positive number on the number line except 1.\n\nDo we get to a point where this same thing holds for multiplication? At some point, do we collect enough primes that we can combine them via multiplication in ways that there's no \"room\" on the number line for any further primes?\n\nLet's assume that the number of primes are finite, and furthermore, let's assume that we have a list of all of them. If we multiply them all together, we get some composite number with all known primes as factors. Let's take this value and add one to it to get a new number.\n\nIs this number prime? Yes, it is. If we divide by any known prime in our list, we end up with a remainder of 1, so it doesn't divide evenly by any known prime, therefore it's not composite.\n\nSo we've just found a new prime that wasn't in our list. This means that no matter how big our list of known primes is, we have a way of constructing a new prime that's definitely not in the list. This means that there must be an infinite number of them since we have found a way to produce a new one.\n\nHopefully this example gives some insight into how mathematical proofs work, even though we start from a set of fixed rules, that doesn't immediately shine line into every corner of every room in the house.\n\n(Another thing you might be interested to read about is Russell & Whitehead's attempt to prove that all of mathematics is a closed and complete system, which was abandoned when Gödel came along and showed that it's not. It turns out in any system of rules that is not \"simple,\" you can always ask a question that cannot be answered without adding more rules.)",

            "text": "The math problems that go unsolved are actually conjectures. Someone makes a claim, and then people try to prove the claim is either true or false. The claim generally begins with the words \"for all\" or \"every\" or \"no _____ exists such that _____\", e.g. \"EVERY even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.\"\n\nTherefore, the \"problem\" can't be \"solved\" by applying a formula. And if the conjecture is true, then it can't be proven with examples. Instead, the proof must reveal a fact about the *structure* of a mathematical theory. To get there, you have to probe and examine the structure while it's all in your imagination. This is hard when the structure is complex.\n\nA mathematical theory is a language, a system of rules of logic, and a set of true statements called \"theorems\". Some theorems are just declared to be true (\"axioms\"); other theorems are true as a consequence of the rules of logic. For example, number theory begins with axioms like \"for all integers x and y, x+y = y+x\" and contains theorems like \"there is no greatest prime number.\"\n\nImagine the theory as a web, where the theorems are points, and arrows from point to point represent steps allowed by the theory's rules of logic. A proof of a theorem is a description of a chain of arrows to it from the axioms.* Sometimes, the shortest path to a theorem is a long and meandering one. To describe such a path, you have to be creative and prove many seemingly unrelated theorems along the way.\n\nAny theory with enough axioms and enough rules of logic to be interesting contains infinitely many theorems, and for any theorem, there's another theorem that's even harder to prove. So it's not surprising that there are unsolved problems (read: unproven conjectures) in math. People come up with enormous amounts of conjectures and it's only Murphy's law that some of them are hard to prove.\n\nThe real surprise is *which* conjectures remain unproven after many years of attempts. Especially in number theory, where they are often seemingly simple statements in layman's terms.\n\nA surprisingly difficult conjecture occurs when:\n\n- The language of a theory allows complexity to be hidden away in a statement that's succinct enough for people to understand and be curious about it\n- the path to the conjecture (or its negation) is on a branch that's far away from all the other theorems discovered so far\n- the web is sparse, i.e. there are not many shortcuts from branch to branch (proofs tend to rely on these shortcuts)\n- humans lack the intuition to imagine what the path would look like or what the first steps would be\n\nBut *why*, for example, is Goldbach's conjecture in that category but not Euclid's theorem, when they're both universal statements about prime numbers? That's still a mystery to me.\n\n\\* This is a philosophical statement. In practice, a proof is just an argument that such a path exists, and since it's written to persuade an educated human audience who can fill in the blanks, the proof is very abbreviated. But still, the longer the path is from the axioms, the harder it is to demonstrate the path's existence.",

However, it has been proven by Kurt Godel that whenever your formal system is recursively axiomatizable (everything useful is) , omega-consistent and strong enough to represent the primitive recursive functions (which is a subset of arithmetically definable functions via theorem 7 of Godel’s paper) then there must be a perfectly constructible sentence “g” such that neither g nor its negation is a theorem of the formal theory. \n\nIn other words, for natural numbers alone we cannot have a negation complete theory we desire.

In layman’s terms, this means that these relationships are *deduced* using logical arguments about their properties, which themselves have already been proved using deductive logical reasoning. \n\nMathematics in its pure form is really about *discovering new properties of mathematical objects* and, in concert, *proving them to be true using known properties that comprise other mathematical results.* It’s a subject which builds on itself. The more you learn, the more there is to know, and the more you can use to discover new properties about these objects. “Unsolved problems” in this sense can mean *properties that may or may not be true, until someone comes along and proves them to be true (or not).*  \n\nThe simple things you learn in primary and secondary mathematics education are the very simple properties that are easy to grasp and allow you to compute things in every day life.\n\n Examples:\n\n1) High school algebra, for example, entails the most basic properties of simple relationships between mathematical objects and how to manipulate those relationships. This is a body of knowledge that can be described much more generally and abstractly (a field of mathematics known, not surprisingly, as *abstract algebra*), which has a much wider meaning to mathematicians. It focuses less on calculating things and more on the underlying properties and relationships of the objects we calculate with, where they are viewed as specific instances of more general structures. \n\n2) High school calculus involves learning the basic tools of a branch of mathematics known as *analysis* to mathematicians. You are taught what properties of continuous functions are, and how to compute things with them, and what happens when things get really really BIG or really really SMALL. In essence, it’s about how to approximate objects with other objects.  But these properties are only valid because a mathematician *proved* them to be using deductive logic.\n\nIf you’ve taken high school geometry, you probably did a brief section on proofs. Ironically, this is closer to the type of thing a professional mathematician does than anything else you may have learned in school, because it’s one of the few times you’re exposed to the basic process of deductive reasoning as it is used by mathematicians.\n\nI hope this helps a little.",
