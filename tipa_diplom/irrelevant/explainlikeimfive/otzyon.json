    "ELI5 remembers u/bossgalaga\nHi Everyone,\n\nWe have come to learn some very sad news recently, u/bossgalaga, the founder of r/Explainlikeimfive, has unfortunately passed away. In his honor we wanted to post the links of two charities that were dear to him:\n\n[The Immune Deficiency Foundation](https://primaryimmune.org/waystogive)\n\n[The Institute for Effective Education](https://www.tiee.org/about/)\n\nWe are forever grateful for what he has created and hope you will consider supporting charitable organizations as he did.  As our regulars may recognize this post is out of character for us but as a mod team we felt these circumstances were unique. This post will stay up for a week, and we will include links to those charities in our wiki.\n\nAdditionally, it has come to our attention that u/bossgalaga made a post in /r/askreddit on July 28th, 2011 (ten years ago yesterday) asking if people would be interested in a sub dedicated to, \"...ask(ing) questions that some people might find obvious -- and to do so without fear of being downvoted, made fun of, or ignored.\" This, of course, led to the start of r/explainlikeimfive. If you're interested in reading that post, [you can do so here.](https://old.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/j2a9k/would_anybody_be_interested_in_a_new_subreddit/)\n\nThank you all for the kind words thus far. u/bossgalaga's friends and family certainly will appreciate them.": [
