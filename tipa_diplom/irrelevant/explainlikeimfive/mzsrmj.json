There are multiple ways.\n\nFor small amounts of cash (less than $100,000), you can get away with just buying everything day to day with it. Think groceries, gas, entertainment, tuition, and dining out. Any major or frequent purchases over $5000 are out of bounds -- the government will come knocking. This level is usually a person who has their own grow business or small dial-a-dope operation.\n\nOnce you get into higher amounts, you can setup smurfs. These are trusted people who are given cash and deposit it into multiple bank accounts in amounts less than $5000. This won't set off any alarms, but you need to trust your people.\n\nAt amounts closing in on $500,000 to $1,000,000 plus, the storage of the cash alone becomes an issue and to limit the number of smurfs in your group, it's time to open a business.\n\nCash businesses like landscaping, construction, and small retailers like coffee shops, gyms, and restaurants work great. You pad your cash income at the end of the day and make sure you pay your taxes.\n\nCharities are another method. You can setup a legitimate charity, give cash to a whole bunch of people, they dontate tens of thousands of dollars at a time, you give them a tax receipt, and then pay out yourself a hefty wage as an administrator.\n\nAs you approach tens of millions, you're going to have a lot of businesses to look after. It becomes a headache.\n\nNow you've got literal tons of cash. It's time to park it in two major concrete goods: art and real estate. \n\nYou can be an anonymous buyer at an art auction and purchases millions of dollars in paintings. These paintings are easy to ship and store and you can then sell them on behalf of an anonymous seller (actually you) and then take a major commission. This commission is then reported as legal income and you pay taxes on it.\n\nReal estate is another great way to put massive amounts of cash in a tangible asset. You have your businesses going, paying employees (usually at really high wages) and you can sell them a decent house or apartment at a ridiculously inflated price. A shady real estate agent and a shady private lender are all you need. You'll be working with them regularly. The idea is you give your buyer (employee/smurf) a massive down payment in cash, they buy your place for a vastly inflated price, then you pay their mortgage each month. In hot real estate markets, some sucker legitimate buyer will come along, maybe even make you money, and then you no longer have to pay the mortgage. Rise and repeat.\n\nThese are the different levels of it all. As you move up, you'll be using a combination of all of them. You'll being expensive accountants, lawyers, real estate agents, and financiers the higher you go. You'll also be seeking different markets that have different reporting requirements.",

If it becomes too obvious that your money source is dirty, professional/serious thieves will come for it. Laundering money is specifically to protect it.  And to protect you from it. All it takes is 1 person finding out you have a pile of cash hidden in the basement, and someone kills your whole family one night to take it. \n\nThat said. The governement wants their cut. Legal or illegal, they expect a slice of your pie. And they look hard for crumbs to lead them to your pie.

A million dollars would feed a family of 6 and keep your tanks full for well over a lifetime without ever coming close to draining.\n\nBut major purchases like cars and houses require too much paperwork. And the gov keeps a record of such things. It sets off MAJOR red flags to try and buy a car with literal cash.

            "text": "Sorry for the wall of text:\nThe point of laundering is to hide HOW it was made. You don't launder money you made legitimately, because it's already been taxed and has a paper trail proving you traded work or services for money. \n\nIf you sold drugs illegally, and made, let's say, 300k in one month in your new enterprise, you can't just go buy a house with that.\nWhat you can do however is start a cash heavy business. Say, ironically enough, a laundromat. \nNow let's assume the laundromat pulls in 10k a month in quarters in the machines. You can't just deposit 300k one month and then 10k a month after, that would look suspicious. If you expect an average of 300k a month from illicit business and 10k a month from legit business you can float your dirty cash in at 15 to 20k a month as income from the laundromat. \nYou then say you expanded from 10 washers and dryers to 20. Either buy them cheaper than you you say you paid for them, or only buy half of the numbers claimed, but give some cash to your friend falsifying the receipt to show you purchased them. Now on the books you have doubled your ability to take in money each month, so you can expect to get more money to flow through the business, because if the irs ever looks you can say \"yes we made 20k a month last year and now with twice the machines we will make 40k a month\"\n\nThen next upgrade the existing machines. But don't. This again will need a friend to falsify receipts for proof, so that business is going to need a kick back of cash to pay in state sales tax and federal income tax. \n\nLet's say your initial washers and dryers were 10 each and let's say each one costs 5k that's 100k plus tax. The company selling them would pay income tax normally on whatever the profit was (their cost minus their sale price pre sales tax) so you give them in illicit funds cash to cover their state sales tax and federal income tax liability, plus 20k. Now you just wrote off 100k+ sales tax for maaaaybe 50k. \nThere are more steps to this process but it's all a shuffle of expenses and depositing the dirty money as if you earned it.\n\nLaundromats and bars / strip clubs generally are good fronts for money laundering because they are generally a cash business. You inflate your daily income with dirty cash, so you can deposit it, and pay taxes on it, and it puts a buffer between you and the illicit activities done to earn it. Another really good front that I was shocked works well for cash in hand business is selling mattresses online in big cities like LA New York and Chicago. Your main goal is to fudge your business operation costs so you can deposit your dirty cash in with your legit business money, but you then use the fudged expenses to off set your tax liability so that you don't end up paying a lions share of it to the fed or the state in taxes. \nOnce you have claimed the income on your taxes, and have a paper trail to \"prove\" it was earned legit, you can spend it however you want. You can show it on your balance sheets when you apply for a mortgage, because you don't have it all in hundreds inside your mattress. \n\n\nAnother way is like others have said. Use it for daily/weekly/monthly expenses. They suggested gas, and groceries, you can also pay your utilities in cash at most grocery stores. But if you are sitting on recurring funds of say 100k+ a month you will have more cash than you can spend in an untraceable way, and becoming an investor in an existing business, or starting your own business will be the easiest way for most to shuffle it all together and make it harder to pin down as \"oh he makes 40k a year and bought a 500k house and a fleet of new tesla suvs last month. \" as you have a paper trail to show how you \"earned\" the money to do this",

Money Laundering aims to run dirty money through many different \"clean\" places so that it appears legitimate. \n\nFor example, suppose you owned a Gas Station and you had $100,000 in dirty money. To launder it, you could slip a few extra hundred dollar bills into the cash register at the end of the day, or you could give small amounts of it to someone else and they could \"invest\" in your gas station bussiness. In the end, the income reports and papers would show that you earned a good sum of money. Done intelligently and carefully, it would be low enough to be perceived as good business/luck by the IRS and Federal Authorities instead of illicit funds. \n\nRepeat the process for a couple of months, and your income reports will keep showing the same thing, that you generated a little more money than usual. The IRS will see it the same way, that you made some good business choices and collected some more money than usual. They'll collect their tax money and be on their way. Now, your $100k is \"cleaned\", and without a very deep investigation society will see it the same way, that you were smart with your business. \n\nNow, back to the question. Why couldn't you just spend your illicit money instead of going through the laundering process? Because it would raise tons of red flags, and people would start noticing that you can always afford things higher than your wage normally allows. \n\nWhen you make a transaction with illicit money, it's digitally stored and taxed. Make too many, and the IRS will say \"Hey, this guy owns a Gas Station and yet he bought 3 diamond rings in the last month. Something isn't right here\". Your bank will notice that you've deposited $100k out of the blue, and they're legally obligated to report any suspicious activity. \n\nWhen that happens, federal agencies get involved. They'll closely monitor your transactions, income, contacts, and businesses and if they find anything linking you to \"dirty\" money, ALL your illicit money will be seized, and you'll be slapped with tons of fines and sentences. \n\nThe moral of the story? If you want to be a criminal, be smart. Or don't be a criminal at all, that works too",

The reason that dirty money needs to be laundered is so that you can make bigger purchases, if you don't launder the money you can only make small purchases before your purchases start raising red flags with the authorities and the reason that that the authorities care is because they want a share of your money in the form of taxes. If you only had dirty money, even though you would still be paying for taxes on your purchases in the form of sales tax you would have not paid income tax on that money.\n\nIf you were a drug dealer making a lot of money, chances are that that is your full time job, so legally you wouldn't have any way of earning all that money which the government can take a share of for taxes, but then when you all of a sudden have 2 fancy cars and a fancy house, that would not make sense with you the income of your legal status which is unemployed.\n\nThat is why the dirty money needs to be laundered, below is why you can't just pay for everything using physical cash.\n\nBanks have to notify the authorities when you deposit $10K or more and once the authorities find out about that deposit they are going to want to find out if something doesn't add up. Now if you have a job where you earn a lot of money in a short amount of time the authorities might deem it to likely be fine. Also if you only do it once or twice, they might even think that, okay maybe you went gambling and won.\n\nIf you are someone that doesn't have a legit job on the other hand, which is often the case with drug dealers or other \"business\" type criminal jobs then there isn't many legal ways that you could have come across that much money.\n\nNow as to why you couldn't pay with everything with physical cash, well you technically can, but realistically not so much, especially when we are talking about large purchases like say a car or a house. Now I don't know if businesses also have that same reporting duty on transactions over $10K but it would not surprise me if they did or if at least they all choose to do it even though they don't have to. Now you may wonder why they would do something like that even though they don't have to, well that's really simple, it's because they don't want to get in trouble themselves, if they are not careful they could be accused of laundering money and that's just not something they would like to deal with.\n\nJust gonna give you a somewhat related example, most stores where I live will not accept 100 Euro or more bills, even if the cost of your purchase is above 100 Euros. Now you might wonder why, well it's because the higher the bill denomination the better it is for people to try to falsify it, so most fake money is of high denomination, so in order to not even deal with the hassle of risk getting fake money, the stores just won't accept them. It's the same type of deal with businesses not taking cash for large purchases, the business just doesn't want to take the risk.",

The thing is, when you get 20 bucks from your friend you don't report it and verify with the government where that bill came from. But if you have $20 million dollars, you sure as hell are going to have to answer questions about that money if you want to do anything with it.\n\nLaundering money comes in 2 forms: 1 use dirty money to buy a clean asset. 2 deposit money and withdraw different money. (there's more advanced ways but that's the bare basics) \n\nIf I buy a Lamborghini for $200,000 and pay the dealer in cash, now the cash his problem. I can sell the Lambo for 180,000 the day after I buy it and if I'm paid in normal clean money I now have 180,000 clean to do anything with. Or I keep the car, either way. \n\nIf I go to a law firm and tell them I'm about to do a bunch of real estate purchases, I need to put 20 million in cash into their trust account to be ready to go. Then I call them and tell them all the deals fell through and I need my money back. They cut me a cheque. Now the cash is their problem and I have clean money.\n\nSo naturally, regulations exist and they exist across most common industries including law, real estate, banking, etc. If you take over X amount of money in a questionable form (such as a suitcase of bills, but really its \"any amount over X dollars in X time period in cash\") you must report it. There are lots of rules and they're different spending on where you are. If you want to ask a \"but what if they did X?\" type question there's probably a law for it. For example making a number of small payments to eventually add up to a number that crosses the line. For our local law society, lawyers cannot take over $7500 in cash from one client without having to report it. And thats cumulative so a bunch of small deposits still add up.\n\nSo the answer is \"because the cash can be traced, and laws make it harder and harder to offload the money in a way that cleans it.\"",

One option would be for Skyler to set up a perfectly legitimate cancer charity, call it the \"White Foundation\" or something. \n\nSet up say, 100 cash donation boxes at car washes all over New Mexico, inviting people to throw their leftover coins or change into the donation boxes. Once a month, have Skyler and/or a trusted friend drive around and collect the donation boxes. In a secure location, stuff the boxes with an additional $100-$500 from the storage locker stash. Make it look like the charity is earning $10,000 - $50,000 a month. Or less - don't overdo it, don't make it look suspiciously successful. Maybe over five years the charity builds up to a donation base of around $3 million.\n\nHave Saul set up a legitimate, legal charity foundation. Have the foundation give real, squeaky-clean donations to cancer research, make this part of the arrangement completely above board. But then, the foundation \"hires\" Skyler as Manager, pay her a legitimate - but not excessive - salary for \"managing\" the \"charity\".\n\nThe benefit? It doesn't launder the entire $80 million but it gives Skyler a stable, legitimate income after Walter dies. Skyler makes a lot of influential friends in charity circles, people she can go to for help or advice. \n\nAnother example, *No Country for Old Men*. Llewelyn finds that $2 million in crisp, carefully sorted bills in the briefcase. The **last** thing he should have done was to nab the briefcase. Instead, he should have put on a pair of gloves, opened it, cast the contents to the wind. Then walk around for a few hours and collect as many dusty, scattered notes on the ground as he could. Maybe write 'Fuck You' on the tree the dead guy was leaning on, to make it look like the dead guy scattered the money out of spite before dying.\n\nHe would have found the tracker, stuffed the collected notes - which would not have been the entire $2 million but still a significant amount of money - into a spare bag, and walked away. \n\nNo way Anton Chigurh would have known he was there, no way for Anton to know how much money Llewelyn would have collected and how much was simply lost in the wind.",

And I realize this sounds a bit like a tautology, but it's not. When you pay for something, nobody cares where the bill itself came from - they care how you got it.\n\nLet's say you deal drugs for a living. You deal a lot, and you are very good at it. You're rich. But if you are, according to the government, unemployed, and have been for the last 10 years, they're going to want to know how it is you can pay a mortgage on your fancy house and the payments in your new BMW. \n\nHowever, if the government thinks you own small chain of convenience stores and you put a couple hundred extra dollars of drug money into the till of each store every day (claiming it, therefore, as income from the store), well now *that* looks a whole lot more legit, and chances are good that they're not going to get suspicious that you're secretly a drug dealer (or at least, they won't get suspicious based on source of your income alone). Cash-heavy businesses like convenience stores are a good choice for this type of laundering, because you don't have to explain where the cash came from. It's cash - all you have to say is that people have been wandering in and out of the store all day, spending $10 here and $5 there. It's really difficult for the police or IRS to show that you're lying about this. If you tried to do this with, say, a car dealership, where you'd suddenly have to falsify a bunch of paperwork in order to pretend to sell a car that you're not actually selling. Much, much easier to do that kind of thing with a chocolate bar.\n\nChances are, there's a business like this in your neighbourhood - it would be the type of business where customers often spend cash (like a sandwich shop, or a nail salon, or something like that), but where you never see any customers inside the shop. They don't seem to actually sell anything ever, so you can't imagine how they stay in business... well, they may be a front for some kind of criminal activity, used as a laundering scheme.

Criminals like the mafia typically have a front like being a garbage consultant or music producer or small business owner. These businesses are legitimate. They file taxes, everything. But the government also knows roughly how much a garbage consultant or music producer or small business owner typically makes. If the criminal should be earning roughly $100k per year, the government might be suspicious if he's living in an 8 figure mansion, driving a six figure car, etc.\n\nSo the criminal needs to have a way to make that money look legit. This is where the money launderer comes in. Among other tactics, they'll make phony businesses that look real and the criminal will have an ownership interest in the phony company. There could be hundreds of these companies set up. The businesses will say they make money, but really, it's the illegitimate gains earned from criminal enterprise.  Now the criminal can give the government a paper trail that seemingly proves the money was earned fairly.\n\nTypically, the government doesn't see someone living out of their means and then investigate them. Rather, they suspect someone of doing something criminal like drug dealing, and proving the criminals money isn't from legitimate sources goes a long way towards proving this. Additionally, if the IRS can come in and prove that taxes weren't paid on the earnings, they can get a conviction on tax evasion, which is typically easier to prove than unraveling the complexities of an organized crime syndicate through a RICO or other criminal statute.",

As OP mentioned you could pay for everything using cash. However, at one point it becomes difficult to hide your wealth, especially if you want to buy cars, houses, other property with title in your name. Sure, you could put the title in other peoples’ names and give them some money for the favor, but the more people involved the more messy it gets. People talk, authorities may ask questions, wealth expands and there isn’t enough people you trust, because adding more property in your best friends’ grandmother’s name who lives on social security and some savings becomes suspicious after her 3rd property. The ones you do trust may also be trying to launder their own money as Wel so you can’t put it in their name. So you buy some laundromats— with legitimate money of course. Meaning it has to come from earnings you paid taxes on. How will they know? Well, if you made over 100k and had 100k after taxes, but your two mortgages, 2 car payments, and cost of basic essentials for you and your family comes out to about 100k then you didn’t have “extra” money. If you can show you only spent 50k for a few years at that Income then you can show you had money unspent.\n\nNow you’ve bought 2 laundromats which profit around 5k a month. 120k for both in one year. You do some remodeling (to show for why you have an increase in business-I’ll explain later). The water and electricity bill is high for laundromats due to the amount of electricity and water used by the machines. Soo you go to the back room and turn on the sink and let the water flow 24/7. You also leave some lights on 24/7 that would normally be off at certain times of the day. Your water/power bill used to be 2k, now it’s 5 or 6k a month. Now you can say you’re laundromat made 15k a month when in reality most of that came from illicit means. You go to the IRS and say here is your tax money. Now that you’ve paid taxes on it you can store it in your bank account and use it to buy whatever you want. If there are any concerns that the laundromat can’t be making around 15k a month, you show them your water/power bill which proves your laundromats are really busy. The sudden increase in business? You remodeled, added better and more numerous machines which brought in more traffic.",

You need to launder that.\n\nFeasibly, you could probably pay $50,000 a year worth of bills and expenses using cash - money orders for rent, cash deposits for utility bills, car payments, insurance, groceries, video games or computer parts at the store etc. If you had a million dollars in cash, and were patient enough, you could probably go through it in 20 years or so without laundering it. But with bigger sums of money, or more pressing time concerns, you can't do the things with cash that you'd like. It'd be nearly impossible to buy a $500,000 house in literal cash. A $160,000 car in cash isn't going to happen. You want to invest $2,000,000 in a real estate development? You can't do that with cash. REAL money - big money - requires laundering.\n\nThe nice part about it is that if you have BIG money to launder, it's actually not that hard to do so. \"Front\" businesses are excellent for laundering a million dollars a year or so. An electrician company, a furniture store, a massage parlor, you name it. Make sure the business is legitimate and conducts real transactions and just pepper in your illegally acquired money throughout. If you need to launder $20,000,000 a year then obviously a massage parlor isn't going to work, but with THAT much money to launder you can get into the casino business, or in the \"fine art\" business or start selling luxury things like boats.

Money laundering isn‘t an active thing you do, you can‘t do something and suddenly dirty money is clean money. Money laundering builds upon the concept of making an excuse to the outside why you have money, so noone questions where it‘s origins are and if they do they‘ll just find some legit looking business. Usually this is done by for example drug dealers that use a facility to create and package drugs but officially to the authorities treat it like it‘s a firm doing real business. Like this they get dirty drug money but to the outside it looks like clean business money. If there was no business you‘d just suddenly have a lot of money that comes from nowhere and if you use it, authorities will notice pretty quickly.",

Getting one junked could be done with cash and not seem too out of place for someone with limited means. All of the parts for the rebuild could be bought cash, one at a time, over the course of a year if not years. Even if they are absolutely premium parts, I don't think they would raise red flags. The rest is elbow grease. Even a bitchin paint job could probably be paid for with hush hush cash. I don't think it's crazy to find a paint shop that wouldn't mind the money being under the table anyway. The end result could be a fabulous muscle car that could be valued at $100k plus if bought or sold in its final condition. But it never was.  \nAs for a sweet mansion, I'd start working on the North slope in Alaska. They fly me up, 3 weeks on, 3 weeks off. $50-$100k salary depending on what you do and what you know. It's not a hard job to get either, if you seem tough. I'd buy a primitive plot of land in rural Alaska. Depending on where it is, this can be had for pretty cheap, even for a decent number of acres. Also, depending on where it is, building codes either don't exist at all, or like, who is coming to enforce? (No one). No property tax either. With my 3 weeks off at a time I'd build the mansion myself. Building materials can be bought cash, and in small enough quantities to not raise red flags.

No prob.  \nEventually I could probably just \"retire\" from my slope job and fuck off to my mansion and go fishing and ATV riding every day. Use my cash to buy groceries and buy the heating oil.  \nI think I could live that way indefinitely.  \nThe remote aspect helps too.

Every amount accounted for. Every move tracked. You literally need a fake job that is also a real job that can be inspected and audited and appears entirely legit.\n\nOddly, healthcare adjacent industries that can set their own prices out of thin air are the best. Of course the $14 shot you purchased can cost the customer $270 out of pocket. And in your books, you claim it was $500 so you can launder the other $230 into someone else's bank account. But you need that to be five or six bank accounts in between you and the other person. And the FBI could still come knocking with a paper trail.\n\nBut millions?

But if you made that money illegally and you continue to do so, there is a high chance that the scheme will be stopped at some point, the money followed to its different outlets and you audited. At that point the investigating agency will seize all of your funds that they can find and it will be tied up until it’s proven they were accrued legitimately. If your money was laundered into a legitimate business with taxes paid and there is no absolute proof of impropriety then you are good! You successfully hedged your bet. \n\nIf you just found 2 million and you want to keep it. That’s fine. Just keep the majority of it locked away in a fire proof safe. Keep all of your transactions under 5k. bring cash when going on trips. Visit Las Vegas once a year cashing out 5k each at the biggest casinos 10 would do the trick. Report those “winnings” to the IRS. It will be taxed but it’ll give you a nice plausible reason for your lifestyle shift. Invest that money into property buying and development.

This process can be done a number of ways, but by far the most common and simple ways is the \"mixing\" method.\n\nThrough \"mixing\", a person mixes in their illegal money with legal income, usually through business revenue. This involves cooking the books for an otherwise legitimate establishment such that it appears to be having wonderful business when, in reality, it's actual income is irrelevant.\n\nThen, at the end of the process, your income appears to have come through a legitimate source.

            "text": "Because physical money is traced by banks, and will eventually end up there. And any old bills that doesn't have the correct security features or is becoming worn and too old will be taken out of circulation. It's how they manage the system. If you have large sums of money, and deposit more then a certain amount, (it differs from each bank) but think like $20,000 in your account, it will be flagged for a large deposit. This doesn't really mean anything, but if you keep doing that, your going to get some attention. Especially if you normally do not make large deposits. Also, many people that rob and get large sums of cash typically have to keep that cash for many years, using it slowly and never spending more then what a normal person would. If you buy a car, don't buy a new car or one at a dealership, buy used from a private person, and don't buy a Porsche when you rent or live in a working class neighborhood, usually people go nuts when they a ton of cash, that's not what you wanna do!\n\n For example: The Boston Gangster Whitey Bulger was running from the law for 16 year's. He had a huge amount of cash, but as time went on the money starts too become old because they change the 100$ bill and update it regularly. So here is Whitey with a few million $, and he can barley spend it, that would be bad if he starts using it around town for years on end, the bank will notify the FEDS that all these old bank notes are coming in and being spent in the area, Whitey was paranoid, and certainly didn't need the FEDS sniffing around where he lived as s retired man, Whitey had so much cash, some of it over 20 years old, he put holes in the wall and stuffed the wall cavities with cash. They found money hiding in every place you could think off, it takes up a lot of space. That's another reason $100 bill is the biggest domination. It takes up space, and it's heavy. $1 million weighs 23 pounds and would fill multiple duffel bags. So how does Whitey spend all this cash and not send up any flags? Las Vegas! That's the easy legal way. You can do it a few different ways, but basically you go to Vegas, and change $10,000 for chips. You stay at the hotel for a few days, and pretty much loose the money on purpose, after you loose $3,000, you trade in your chips, and walk out with $7,000 all in brand new current circulation bills. Casino's don't report your losses only large gains, which doesn't happen too often, and they will take any American currency and not care or ask why you have bills that are 30 years old, Whitey Bulger did just that, he was taking trips to Vegas to wash the money, had millions of dollars, but he didn't live like a millionaire, you can't, so really it's not glamourous as one would think. You can't be rich or act rich, it just gives you unwanted attention. Poor people however hardly pay taxes and we'll, they don't have shit. And that's exactly how Whitey had to live. He lived in a decent part of town in a retirement area, and rented. He rented from a private owner, not a rental corporation, and the landlord never minded or questioned cash. He was pretty much a prisoner in his own home. His girlfriend and himself basically would go to Costco like once a year and buy crazy amounts of bath products, etc, for he didn't have to leave the house and risk being seen. They had a deep freeze for food and basically lived like hermit's, he didn't own a car, and just wore normal basic clothing. Now if you are business man and want to hide money, essentially washing it for the IRS doesn't get they're piece, you can hide it a number of ways like slush funds, fake donations and charities, gifting it to fake shell corporations who are also in on it,  anything to just give you a deduction on your tax return, but you never gave it away, you just made a paper trail in case you get audited and have proof you gave half a million dollars to so and so. That's why crooks wash money and white collar business men.",
