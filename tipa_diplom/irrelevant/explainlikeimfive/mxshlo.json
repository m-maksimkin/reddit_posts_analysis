Blow it out with compressed air and clear any external debris to maximize its lifespan)\n* You need this antibacterial soap because bacteria is bad!

Also, things like triclosan are possibly carcinogenic, and there is debate on if risks outweigh benefits. Also, regular soap washes the bacteria and its \"food\" from your skin well enough already)\n* Fill the detergent to this line (you almost always need less detergent than they say)\n\nI'm sure it's well-intentioned to encourage people to replace their sponge, but I have a hard time believing you can't rinse out dead bacterial remains and other soils from a sponge with a strong detergent and some patience.",

I use one of each every day, and then put them in a large container.  When I get around 20 of them I wash them in the washing machine.  Hottest water, sanitary if the machine has that, with a small amount of detergent and a good amount of chlorine bleach ending with an extra rinse cycle.\n\nI air dry them on a counter (takes a few days).  If you dry them with heat in a tumble dryer the sponges won't last very long at all.\n\nEvery day we start with a new sponge, and I really can't see how there is any dead bacteria residue in them.  They smell fresh, and I think they are much cleaner and sanitary than microwaving, boiling, or putting them in the dishwasher.  The bleach and hot water kill bacteria, the repeated washing and spinning removes the residue.\n\nThey last 6 to 8 months before I have to replace them.",
