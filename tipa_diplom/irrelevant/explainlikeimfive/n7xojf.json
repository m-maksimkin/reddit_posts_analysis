Have someone buy 5 cans, 5 glas bottles and 5 plastic bottles from the same store with the same best-before-date, essentially ensuring that storage conditions and duration isn't the blame. Then have them - without you seeing it - pour a glass of each in identical glasses and have them randomly arranged on a table. Remove all containers and let whoever did the pouring leave the room as well, after they created a 'map' of what was in which glass, which they of course take with them as well. Only then enter the the room and taste 11 of the 15 samples and sort them into category groups.

One of our quality release criteria is the  gas volume- the amount of CO2 present in the bev and we set a certain range, rejecting those products that fails or exceeds the set limit. \n\nGlass and aluminum cans have lower porosity. This makes the 2 as good packaging materials since it helps  retain gas volumes in soda. in other words, glass and metal prevents the CO2 from \"escaping\",  maintaining the fresh biting taste. On the other hand, plastic/PET bottles have higher porosity than the 2, which means CO2 can easily escape making the soda  bland. To compensate this difference, we deliberately increase gas volumes in PET products. fresh bottled PET sodas have very strong \" bite\" due to high volumes of CO2. \n\nAlso, you can confirm this by their expiry. If you notice, glass and metal packed beverage have longer expiry dates that PET ones. In bev industry, expiry is not determined by flavor going bad but by CO2 retention. Since glass or metal can retain gas better they can last up to1 yr whereas PET only can last 3 to 6 mos. \n\nOther factors affecting taste are trace iron in crowns/caps, trace acetaldehyde in PET and oxidation (prolonged direct sunlight exposure).",

(This is why your favorite soda tastes better to more people at a fast food restaurant coming from a fountain machine!)   Over time, this carbonation and syrup mixing effect becomes slower and more dull, aka less reactive, causing the flavor we taste to be less intense.    Second: This timing of carbonation interacting with syrup is affected by the material in which the beverage is held plus the SIZE of the space through which carbonation can escape.   \n\nFor example:  glass is not ultra reactive to carbonation and decreases the amount of reaction happening between the material and the carbonation.  However, a glass bottle versus a glass cup will have extremely different ‘taste good’ times because carbonation escapes way faster through a wider opening of a glass cup (2” diameter) than it would a glass bottle (~3/4” diameter).  \n\nAnswers from everyone are all contributing factors, but we can’t forget about how the plastic/aluminum/glass/styrofoam interact specifically with the carbonation in the drink and the space through which carbonation escapes.  It’s a complicated science that allows us to fully enjoy the drink at optimum taste!!",

Formaldehyde-based lubricants were eventually discontinued, but consumers were already accustomed to these taste difference in canned sodas.
