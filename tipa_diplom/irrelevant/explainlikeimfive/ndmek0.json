We don't often need many digits of Pi to properly do calculations.  If I am calculating the circumference of a circle I want to draw  that is 100.0 cm across (precisely measured to 1/10th of a cm) I need to use the same number of significant digits when I multiply by pi.\n\nCircumference =  π × Diameter = 3.1415 x 100.0 = 314.15 \n\nbut we are only accurate to 4 significant figures, so we present the answer as 314.2 cm.  (my original measurement was only precise to 1/10 of a cm)\n\n**We generally don't need a high level of precision in calculations**, and inexpensive calculators often make sacrifices to the number of significant figures they carry.\n\nThere are lots of factors beyond ELI5, like the number of bits of the CPU (8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, 64 bit) and the format for storing and working with numbers.\n\nIf you are doing simple calculations with really big numbers you use \"[scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation)\" **to display the level of precision** of your measurements.\n\nThere is also the question of what format (binary code) you are using to store these numbers.  [look here](https://www.exploringbinary.com/pi-and-e-in-binary/)\n\n* **Binary Floating-Point Formats**\n\nIn binary floating-point, irrational numbers (infinitely precise) are rounded to a set limit. Here’s how rounding works in five different levels of precision:\n\n *   In half-precision, values are rounded to **11 significant bits**.\n\n   This equals 3.140625 in decimal \n\n *   In single-precision, values are rounded to **24 significant bits**.\n\n  This equals 3.1415927410125732421875,\n\n *   In double-precision, values are rounded to **53 significant bits**.\n\n  3.141592653589793115997963468544185161590576171875\n\n *   In extended-precision, values are rounded to **64 significant bits**.\n\n *   In quadruple-precision, values are rounded to **113 significant bits**.\n\nIn this format Pi is a stream of 1s and 0s.  Here are the first 43 bits of Pi in binary\n\n* 11.00100100001111101101010100010001000001011\n\nAs you see from the stuff above, we seldom need more than single precision (24 bits binary)\n\nlots of [good info here](https://www.exploringbinary.com/pi-and-e-in-binary/)",

            "text": "For many calculations, a calculator may only need a dozen or so digits of π to get an accurate answer.\n\nHowever, there are some calculations that require many more digits. The trigonometric functions are periodic, with period 2π. To calculate the sine of 9.999999999•10^(99), you need to calculate the remainder when that number is divided by 2π (and then the remainder is used in an engineered polynomial that approximates sine or in some other algorithm for computing trigonometric functions, such as CORDIC).\n\nNow, somebody normally should not be taking the sine of a number that large. There are various numerical problems that arise using numbers that large. However, that is the user’s problem. If they give us a number and ask for the sine, we want to calculate it accurately. (And sometimes large multiples of angles might arise through manipulating various trigonometric identities, and they will largely reduce if the calculation is done correctly. So we want to try to do a good job.)\n\nSo, for the sine function in a calculator to work well, it has to be able to calculate that remainder accurately. In effect, that requires having over a hundred digits of 2π—in addition to calculating 100 integer digits of a number around 10^(99)•2π, you need more fraction digits to calculate the residue accurately.\n\nUsually, that information is not stored directly as digits of 2π. Depending on the hardware available, it may be stored as pieces of prepared reciprocals of 2π (or related numbers like π or π/2). Whatever data is needed, it is computed when designing the calculator, using extended-precision software, and stored in the programming of the calculator.\n\nAdditionally, if we wanted to be fancy, we do not need to store the digits of π in order to have them available when we need them. We know ways to calculate the digits, using series that add up to π or other methods. This is how extended-precision software obtains π—it calculates as many digits as needed when they are needed.

This is why you can take `1÷7=`, `×7=` and get `1` rather than `0.999999999999` - the calculator might have *displayed* `0.142857142857` as the answer to the first calculation, but internally it remembered the answer as `0.1428571428571428571428571`, which multiplied by 7 gives `0.9999999999999999999999997`, and when this is rounded to the 13 digits that fit in the display, rounds to `1`.\n\nI would guess that the stored value for pi has one of the following lengths:\n\n* the number of displayed digits\n* the number of displayed digits plus one\n* double the number of displayed digits\n\nFrom high school science classes I remember the rule of \"significant digits\": when you get your final answer, you round it to the total number of digits equal to the number within your calculations that had the fewest digits (excluding any temperature values, which for whatever reason are always treated as \"exact\" and therefore are ignored in this determination).\\*\n\nExample:  \n`175.4 × 362.6 ÷ 20.0 = 3180.002` but this gets rounded to 3 significant digits, as that's how many are in `20.0`, so you report it as `3180`.\n\nSince any number that you manually enter into the calculator can never have more digits than fit in the display, the second of the above guesses should generally be able to provide sufficient precision to ensure that final results are accurate to at least as many decimal places as the operand with the fewest significant digits.\n\nAs for calculators in phones and computers, they probably store quite a few more digits than most people would ever need - probably all of the digits that can be stored in a particular type of floating point variable. After all, while *calculating* the true value of pi to many decimal places may be very computationally intensive, *storing* the value to the same number of digits is quite trivial.\n\n\\* Actually, I now remember that the rule I stated above applies to multiplication and division; for addition and subtraction you go by the digit column of the least precise value, so for example if you're adding/subtracting these numbers: `1700` `675` `224.8`, then that answer would be rounded to the hundreds place.",

You could think of it like \"on\" or \"off.\" Bits are grouped together into sets of 8 called \"bytes.\" When you want to store a decimal number in a computer, you have to first convert it to bits. When a decimal number is represented in binary, it's called a \"floating point\" number. It's called a floating point number because the precision, or the number of meaningful (or significant) digits you can store, stays the same, but the decimal place can move around. The more bits you use, the more significant digits you can store. \n\nMost calculators use something called \"single precision,\" which is 32 bits, or 4 bytes. Those can store decimal numbers with up to 9 significant digits. That means you can represent a number like pi out to 8 decimal places accurately (the first digit is for the 3 before the decimal). If you have a calculator that can display pi, and it is using single precision, you'll see that there is a 9th decimal place too. That is the last bit, and it is not \"significant.\" This means it is rounded, and when you use that number in calculations, the error due to rounding will start to accumulate. If you (for example) added pi to itself many times, the answer would become less and less accurate as you continued to add it. You can check this yourself by adding it to itself 50 or so times, then dividing by pi. You won't get a whole number back, and the difference between it and the expected number is the accumulated error.\n\nScientific programs often use something called \"double precision\" for important calculations. Double-precision floating point numbers can store 15-17 significant digits, which means the numbers can be added, multiplied, and divided many more times before reaching a similar amount of error.\n\nIf you really need more precision, they have even larger floating point representations - quadruple, octuple, and \"extended.\" However, those are not widely available and I don't believe any calculators support them.",

Over a kilometer that's less than a single step from an adult. Over a square kilometer that's about the seat of an office chair. And if you filled an olympic swimming pool into a water balloon calculated this way is would be off by just 12 bathtubs or 3 small jacuzzis.\n\nAnother digit and were down to a single small jacuzzi or about as much water as would evaporate in a single day if it's outside.\n\nAnd with a fourth decimal digit the difference would barely fill a bathtub.\n\nWith a fifth decimal digit, which is about what is easy to remember (because when you type (3.)14159, the numbers form a check mark on the number pad), the difference between that olympic pool sized water baloon calculated properly and calculated cheaply are about 3-4 large bottles of coke.\n\nThose 3-4 bottles of coke are about the amount an adult couple should drink each day (well, not coke) and the city is going to deal with a lot more water than that each day. So the difference matters. But those aren't the kind of problems that are solved using pocket calculators. And at that point other sources of errors need to be accounted for as well.",
