Unless ***I’m*** misunderstanding I think you mean is it possible to harm a plant by giving it more nutrients than it requires for survival. The answer is yes! Over feeding a plant makes it look superficially healthy, bigger, bushier etc but the plant will be weaker and harder to keep alive. The pots of herbs you buy in supermarkets are blasted with fertiliser to make them look bigger (and often it’s not one plant but 4-5 crammed together in too small a space). As you might have experienced yourself, those supermarket herbs die pretty quickly, even in the hands of people who know about plants. Sorry to go off on a supermarket herb tangent but you can keep them alive by unpotting them, carefully separating out the plants from each other and putting them in their own pots with good quality soil. And laying off the plant food. Hope I’ve answered your question!",

That's what fat is, an energy storage to access later when food is not available.\n\nThe most obvious example of plant food storage is a potato; it's full of delicious starchy goodness solely to have a place to store extra energy. Deciduous trees evolved by dropping leaves (which cost energy) and storing energy in roots; maple season's sap running is what brings the energy back to the rest of the tree. (All plants with seeds store energy there, too, but that isn't for the plant's benefit, it's for the offspring so it can sprout. Many also store energy for fruits, but that's for the benefit of whatever creature eats the fruit so it will spread the seeds, so again isn't really what you're asking) \n\nMany plants store energy in their roots. Most plants that do so are perennials that live in areas with a winter season; alpine plants, tundra, temperate, but less desert or tropical or savannah. \n\nWhat plants can store food can't always store a lot. Animals evolved fat because they don't have constant passive sources of energy; fat serves this purpose if they store enough. Plants however rarely have to do without the sun; many plants if denied the sun long enough will simply die. All plants photosynthesize, and the sun is ever-burning, so food storage is relatively rare, and usually only developed for seeds, fruit, or if part of the plant dies off over winter. \n\nSo no, plants can't get fat, but most can store energy in some way and a very few can store it for later retrieval, mostly to regrow after a sun-starved winter.\n\n**Edited for clarity of speech**",

Winter, and spring passed, that first summer, it produced maybe 30/40ish peaches. A buddy of mine gave me advice and said “Put a piece of ribbon tape on every little branch shoot that doesn’t produce peaches. When winter hits and the nutrients go back in the ground, slice those branches off.” \n\nSounded easy peasey, so I did it. Next year, I had over 100 peaches. Rinse and repeat for several more years.\n\n\nLast summer, I produced so many peaches half of my tree snapped in half. I plan on adding supports to my wild branches this year so it doesn’t happen again... I love peaches!",
