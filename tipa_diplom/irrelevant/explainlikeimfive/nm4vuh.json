    "ELI5: Why do \"red skies at morning\" mean it's going to storm later that day?\nThe old saying goes, \"Red sky at night, sailor's delight.  Red sky at morning, sailors take warning.\"  Red skies at dawn mean storms are coming.  Is that even true?  And if it is, how can red skies at morning bring storms, but red skies at night mean fine weather?": [

            "text": "So first off you need to know about light and its different wavelengths, im fairly sure red light has a longer wavelength while blue light is much shorter. \n\nWhen light shines through the atmosphere red light having a long wave can easily get past and around small particles without being deflected or blocked unlike blue light which gets filtered out by those fine particles.\n\nThe sun rises in the east and sets in the west which also drives the wind and weather systems as the sun heats the air and water. \n\nSo when the sun rises or sets most of the light is traveling all the way through the atmosphere, like instead of going top down the light is going side to side so it passes through much more of the atmosphere and any suspended particles will filter out blue light while allowing red light to pass right through and this mostly happens at sunrise or sunset when the light is going east/west instead of top down like at noon.\n\nSo thats the bit about the red skies (how/why the sky turns red) the red color is important because it means the air has lots of particulate which water vapor needs in order to condense. So if you see a red sky then whatever air that light is passing through will drop its moisture as soon as the relative humidity reaches 100%\n\nSo the next bit is about the timing, red sky at morning sailor take warning, this means if you see a red sky in the morning then not only is there going to be a storm but its going to be coming your way. \n\nYou can tell because the sun rises in the east and creates a heat/pressure front that pushes most weather systems to the west, so if you see a red sky at morning then your seeing the sunlight passing through the air to your east and you know there will be a storm to your east which will be pushed west so you will have to deal with it.\n\nIf you see a red sky at night sailor delight means that you see a potential storm (red sky) but since its night/sunset your seeing the light pass through the atmosphere to your west and the storm should continue further west.\n\nTl;dr:\n\nSo the red sky means a potential storm.\n\nAt morning or night tells you if the potential storm is to the east or west and that tells you if the storm is behind you or in front of you. \n\nThis isnt a perfect methodology for predicting storms/weather and its a bit outdated but its still pretty cool.",

            "text": "\"red skies\" means the morning or evening sun is lighting up clouds, and it's important where those clouds are in relationship to you, keeping in mind that weather patterns typically move from west (sunset) to east (sunrise). Very broadly speaking, bad weather (as in a frontal system) starts with high clouds and gets progressively lower as it gets closer. If the sun is rising to your east and lighting up high clouds above you, a front is coming. If you can see red light at all it means that the sky is pretty clear between you and the horizon. So if it's morning and red sky you know that the clear weather has already passed to your east, but the high clouds are an early sign of approaching bad weather from the west. Meanwhile if it's evening with a red sky you know the weather is clear all the way to the west, and that clear will be tomorrow's weather for you",

            "text": "It has to do with the scattering of incoming solar radiation. It is called Rayleigh scattering. the way weather systems travel is from west to east. \n\nThe sun rises in the east and sets in the west. \nIncoming solar radiation deflected sideways at an angle. If that angle is high then it brings about blue skies and such. If there is a blue sunrise that, to me, as a weather forecaster tells me I have low pressure to my east. The storm has passed. \n\nAs a result of low pressure being to my east, I will have high pressure to my west. High pressure is associated with good weather and great conditions. The high pressure is to come and move over my station. \n\nHigh pressure brings about a low sun angle because it condenses the atmosphere. This low sun angle gives us our red sunrises and sunsets.\n\nEdit: This is more of a mid latitude United States phenomenon. I decided to give it another shotâ€” see belowðŸ‘‡\n\nSun rises in the east and sets in the west.  \n\nCool. \n\nIf at any point the sun rise or sun set is the color orange, red, or pink it can be inferred that the atmosphere is being condensed under the influence of high pressure. Because the sun is low in the sky and the atmosphere is condensed this is used to locate where high pressure is. Whether it is departing or arriving to you. \n\nOn the other hand, low pressure within the atmosphere allows it to expand. Therefore, wherever low pressure is located the sky at sun rise and sun set will not appear the colors aforementioned but will be your usual blue sky. This is due to the lack of condensation in the atmosphere. It allows the blue to be seen instead of the other colors on the visible spectrum. \n\nIn the mid latitudes (not the equator or the poles) between 60 degrees N and 30 degrees N there is the polar front jet (jet stream) that is high in the sky and it helps high pressure and low pressure move across mid latitudes in a west to east fashion as this is the only way the wind travels in the polar front jet. So this is the way low pressure systems (more commonly frontal boundaries) move with high pressure ahead and behind the fronts. \n\nWeather is fluid and ever changing.
