Everyone who is able to see the color red has a distinct marker for what color red a stop sign is.

We know that when we mix red and blue, we get purple. When we mix red and yellow, we get orange. When we mix blue and yellow, we get green. And, etc etc etc.\n\nSo, if the color you see when you look at red, yellow, and orange look in your brain like blue, red, and green look, respectively, in my brain, that means when you mix the colors I see as blue and red, you get the color I see as green, instead of the color I see as purple.\n\nI suppose this isn't impossible, but I don't see how it's possible. The rules that govern how red and blue mixing makes purple aren't just perception, it's based on the wavelengths of light that we can measure scientifically. You're unlikely to perceive the world in a way that has those colors mixing and making some other color that doesn't make sense.\n\nSo, what this tells me is that if that premise is correct, one of 3 situations must be true:\n\n* we all perceive the exact same color wheel in the exact same way.\n\n* we all perceive the exact same color wheel, but potentially rotated relative to each other.\n\n* we all perceive colors in a color space that would be potentially totally alien to each other. When my brain perceives blue, I see a color you've never ever seen before, and when your brain perceives blue, you see a color I've never ever seen before.",

Humans had the biological capacity to see blue back then because the structure of human eyes and the structure of light itself are the same as they are now. Ancient peoples simply never recognized blue as a distinct category from the other colors, since as color is a spectrum with no clear divisions between infinite shades.

Two people can look at a painting or an outfit or anything colorful, and they remark: wow, look at that fuschia! Or is it more magenta? Hmm, no I think it's maroon. This shared discussion of color is about the closest we can come to confirming that we *perceive* the same colors.   \n  \nScientifically, there's more solid ground to stand upon. First, in physics, colors are a combination of different wavelength photons: it's a fact that red photons have a certain amount of energy, and that blue photons have a bit more energy, and our eyes and brain \"translate\" that energy into color. Plants do this too: they like certain colors for photosynthesis but not others, due to energetic receptiveness of their own enzymes. Plants like fruit also \"tell\" humans when to pick them, by ripening and acquiring colors to signal their tastiness.\n  \nBiologically, however, there is a little wiggle room. While humans are genetically encoded to have VERY similar color receptors in our eyes, we might have slight mutations that remove that color-seeing functionality (color-blindness), or we might have slight mutations which could have unknowable effects on color vision. There's also the fact that color-vision is developed in the brain, in the neural circuitry. Someone who paints or does graphic design will have a more developed neurological ability to discern color differences.  \n  \nAll of this to say, while there's science at the underpinnings of color, on a personal level it is perceived. Just like music, a trained musician might notice more subtleties, more overtones, or if something is on pitch or not. A trained artist will have a better color vision than the average person, but they will not see blue as fundamentally \"red\" due to the above physics.",

Normally people only have 3 cones, which are roughly tuned to the red, green, and blue wavelengths of light.  Some forms of color blindness basically prevent the affected cones from triggering on a specific wavelength (red or green for example).  Another mutation is one called tetrachromacy, while I can't find too many details on how it works in humans (it's incredibly rare) it seems to allow people to see even more difference between colors, and sometimes even see colors when others can't.  Some people with certain eye conditions can also see slightly into the ultraviolet range.",

This needed only to be done for physical colors that are spectral, since a linear combination of spectral colors will be matched by the same linear combination of their (IS, IM, IL) matches. Note that in practice, often at least one of S, M, L would have to be added with some intensity to the physical test color, and that combination matched by a linear combination of the remaining 2 lights. **Across different individuals** (without color blindness), the matchings turned out to be **nearly identical**.\"",

Our brain does the interpretation of said electrical signals.\n\nYou if you're talking about the chemical part (the eyes) or the the whole process as a whole, as in \"being able to interpret reality in a way that we can effectively communicate\", we have a very good understanding that its very much similar on most humans. We accurately mapped parts of the brain responsible of each part of \"seeing\".\n\nBut once you focus on the finer details, the \"code\" in the analog to digital analogy, of how each brain interprets color, then there's a lot more to talk about.\n\nFirst, keep in mind that the brain's interpretation of reality is very susceptible by environmental influence. You can see that in events like mass hysteria and psychosis. Using the US as an example, [a study estimates that 25% of the US population believes in QAnon](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/study-finds-nearly-one-five-americans-believe-qanon-conspiracy-theories-n1268722), meanwhile, [psychosis rate is lower than 1%](https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/mental-health/psychosis/psychosis-statistics/). If you start considering religion and spirituality as deviations from an objective perspective it becomes even more clear how our brains can distort our perception of reality. [Synesthesia](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/04/050411210623.htm) is another fascinating insight into how complex the process truly is, and how it can deviate from the norm.\n\nAnother relevant fact is how our brains interprets inputs, [and how malleable it is to adjust to new/different inputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLk8Pm_XBJE). Deaf/Blind people depictions of reality is astoundingly different than the rest of the population. Factor in physiological and psychological differences and answering your question becomes a lot more trickier.\n\nAs our understanding of the inner workings of the human brain is still very much incomplete, it could very well be that the finer details of how our brains \"calculates\" the interpretation of vision, and other senses for that matter, is something that we completely develop during life, making each person perception of reality truly unique.\n\nThe most honest to your question, besides philosophical ones, is that we don't know. All one can do, as i tried to, is conjecture based on our current data. But as the data itself is incomplete, the conclusions are fated to also be, so take my conclusion with a kilo of salt.",

For instance, we know that most people see 515 nm light as one colour, 700 nm light as another colour and 575 nm  light as a third colour, but there is also a mix of the first two frequencies of light that most people would see as indistinguishable from the third pure frequency.  We also know that there are a minority of people who see all of those as the same colour instead of 3 different ones.\n\nIn English, those of us who can see the difference agree that those colours are called green, red, and yellow  respectively.  If someone who is not colourblind and who speaks English sees 575 nm light, they will see a colour they would call \"yellow\".\n\nWhat we don't know is whether the perception going on in their mind is the same as when someone else sees the same light.  If when we both look at yellow, we would agree it's \"yellow\" even if the perception in one of our minds is what the other would call \"magenta\"  and there would be no way for either of us or anyone else to tell that was happening.\n\nThis internal representation of perception within our minds is called \"qualia\" by philosophers and it is the subject of much pointless argument.  \n\nFor instance, there's the idea of the P-zombie, which is a mind that behaves identically to a normal one when viewed externally, buck lacks some invisible internal property ascribed to normal minds such as qualia (Or, consciousness, free will, empathy, etc).  For all you know, I might not only have different qualia from you, I might lack them entirely, but still behave the same way as a mind that does have them, and you couldn't tell the difference.  Even I wouldn't necessarily be able to tell the difference because I might *think* I had qualia even though I didn't, and the same could be true of you.  Except of course that because qualia are thoughts, maybe if we think we have them then we do so a p-zombie that thinks it has qualia is impossible and a p-zombie without them would have to lie when it said it did have them.\n\nAs you can see, it's pointless even by the standards of philosophy which is in large part the art of making the  the pointless into something that at least seems relevant.  Not that this is inherently a bad thing since trying to find uses for the seemingly pointless sometimes results in very useful new ideas, Mathematics and Science started out as the seemingly pointless musings of philosophers.

According to some authors, purple does not have its own wavelength of light. For this reason, it is sometimes called a non-spectral color. It exists in culture and art, but not, in the same way that violet does, in optics. According to some speakers of English, purple is simply a combination, in various proportions, of two primary colors, red and blue.[53]\n\nThere is a theory floating around, since purple isn’t a specific wavelength, but a mix of red and blue wavelengths, that our minds have to make up what purple looks like. But we all think purple looks very similar to violet, which is a specific wavelength. And since we all think this mind-generated color looks the same, then we can conclude it is likely that we all really do see colors the same way. (Expect for color blind people, of course.)",

Because we share the same or similar receptors in our eyes that capture specific wavelengths of light, from the universe to our gate of perception, color is consistent.\n\nInternally, it’s extremely hard to know if my brain and your brain “see” that color consistently. What may appear red to me might appear to you as my blue. But because it’s consistent until it reaches our brain, we can objectively refer to that color as red; even if you actually experience it differently than I experience. Because this physical consistency of color is also associated with cultural signifiers, we collectively experience color similarly. This is not consistent across cultures, but it’s pretty consistent within cultures itself. Red/orange is physically experienced in blood/fire, so it becomes a cultural signifier of violence/passion/anger because those are human emotions that are connected with the physical impression of those colors. So when you see something bright red, you might associate it with that cultural emotional palette similarly to other people of your culture. \n\nRegardless of how your brain “sees” the color, the input signals are processed similarly and we’re raised in similar enough cultures that our experience is similar enough that it doesn’t really matter.\n\nCertainly, you could have your own emotional associations with specific colors, you could also have your own way of seeing specific colors.

Nor is it a unique result of the mixing of colors. Every other 'color' has a place in the rainbow, and could be either a primary color or made from a defined combination of colors. \n\nThis led to a conclusion: brown is how we see colors that we can't see. Brown is the stand in color for colors that we never evolved to percieve. Brown is what you get when you mix too many colors, too high complexity, and the neural circuitry to categorize that 'specific' combination does not exist. I concluded that since he can't see red (his retinal receptors are missing), he must be seeing brown. My lips and cheeks are brown to him. \n\nThis makes me kind of suspect that we see brown the same way, although, not necessarily the cas. Can't be sure.",

It's just that, to them, the colors have little difference. Telling red from green to a color blind is as easy as it is telling the difference between beige and tan for us. Sometimes really easy, sometimes surprisingly hard. In that same way some people have 4 fundamental color cones, and as such can differentiate between colors that we couldn't. But here's the crazy thing: they can't see more colors, and that's because colors, as a shared experience, are invented by the culture.\n\nYou learn red when you're little. A teacher (can be parent, random adult, other kid) will show you something red and tell you \"this is red\". Then they'll show you something else and say \"that is red too\". Then they'll show you the sky and say \"but that is blue\". They are making you experience the act of seeing things of a certain color\n\nIt's crazy but it's true. Before we started defining the color \"orange\" by that name, it was seen as a yellowish red, or reddish yellow, people couldn't see the third color until it was defined and given a name. It's crazier than that, all human civilizations [invent colors in roughly the same order](https://laughingsquid.com/words-for-colors-invented-in-same-order/). As a matter of fact Japanese or Russians can identify a blue and a kind of teal that most Americans can't identify easily yet.\n\nAnd here's the thing. Everyone has an experience just slightly different, but we still call it the same experience. In that sense we all see the same color because we all agree. As to what that experience is like. Well we're egocentric beings, we can only be ourselves and never someone else. That means we can't quite know. Even if you lived someone's experiences, you'd see them through your interpretation of the mind. Otherwise we'd have to remove all the memories, and make all the neural pathways a perfect copy of the other, which would effectively erase you entirely. It's a bit weird to think of it, but it's not that crazy I think.\n\nThe disagreements of this, the belief in qualia, all of this is by trying to explain why colors act like experiences, work as experiences, and handled and taught as experiences, and yet they happen to be a physical effect. The latter was never really defined at all!",

Then your brain interprets  and analyses this signal, and the analysis says:\n\n“this signal is similar to signals that I have received, in the past, that related to the colour of grass, and limes and cucumbers”\n\nThis is used to add the green colour to the picture you “see” in your head. \n\nBut here’s the trick: that picture doesn’t really exist. The only way we could take that picture and project it into a tv, would be if we also took all the info from your memory as well that links the colour green to your past experiences of things that are green in real life.

Those are codes that go beyond naming the colors just with words (although they have fancy names), the most importan part is the combination of inks that create the color (lessening a bit the qualia; if we have all agreed in a color, we pick the mix of inks/light of that color, not a the individual name we give to it, according to our experience).\n\n\rIn the end we can say there is a split answer: true, we (as individual beings with eyes) will never agree in the way we experience colors (if we get too picky, no one can see the same green that other person, and there are even colors that we can't see); but there are codes (for different industries and purposes) that unify colors, to some extent, in order to minimize disagreements (we all see differen colorst, but if we all think Pantone 15-5519 is, moreless, the color we like; we can get over the argument of how to name it and just use the code -Pantone named it *Turquoise*, for those who don't want to say so many numbers :P-).\r  \n\r  \nAn example of how (moreless) the Pantone catalogue looks: https://www.pantone-colours.com/",

            "text": "I first heard of this question in a Vsauce video about 10 years ago. As a teen, I used to be very fascinated with the idea that the colors we see may be different but it didn't take me very long to realize that this is just another one of those pseudophilosophical questions that is designed to cause controversy yet has a fairly straightforward answer. I'm aware that many people have answered the scientific aspect of the question, but I'm here to elucidate some of the more philosophical aspects. (This may be a bit long for an ELI5, but bear with me please)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Scientific aspect:**\n\nI'll try to be brief. Our sight relies on biological pigments found mainly in cone cells in our eyes. There are 3 different types of cone cells, each one having a different pigment. When light hits the back of the eye, these pigments are broken down in varying amounts in a complex series of events which ultimately results in a specific electrical signal being transmitted to the brain. This signal is specific based on which color was seen. The brain then interprets the information to allow you to perceive color.\n\nIt is clear that, at the eye, there cannot be any differences in the colors we perceive. All healthy humans have the same pigments, along with the other things needed to produce the electrical signal, meaning that the same signal will be produced for the same color in different humans. Therefore, if there is to be a difference, it would have to be at the brain.\n\nWell, our brains consists of the same types of cells arranged in a very similar manner and ultimately producing very similar brain activity when exposed to different color environments.  This means that it is safe to assume, based on the scientific information, that we do indeed see the same colors.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Philosophical aspect:**\n\nThe philosophical side of the question revolves around whether there is an objective standard by which we judge color. Our first instinct is to say that there is no objective standard *per se*: we may both call an apple \"red\", but our reds may be different. However, there is definitely somewhat of an objective standard when considering color, and that is darkness and light.\n\nWe all perceive darkness in the same way; darkness is closest to the color black. This can also be explained in scientific terms, but I won't get into that. Anyway, we know that darkness is closest to black and we intuitively, though we may not expressly know it, know that light is closest to white.\n\nThis is big. Not only does this allow us to be virtually certain that we at least see black and white the same way, but it gives us a way in which we can compare colors. For example, we can agree that pure blue is darker than pure red, or that pure green is darker than pure yellow. There are many comparisons like these that can be made. If we all saw colors differently, it is highly unlikely that all of our color comparisons would match.\n\nAnother way in which we can look at identifying whether we see the same colors is through contrast. We know that some colors stand out more when placed against other colors (this is the concept of \"complementarity\"). For example, we know that placing pink and green next to each other will create a stronger contrast than placing blue and pink next to each other, and so on. While it is true that the contrast comparison is fallible, it is highly unlikely that all differences in color sight would create the same contrast comparisons in every person.\n\nFinally, I think that the idea of combining colors to create a new color can also come in handy when considering the question. We know that combining red and blue gives purple, red and yellow gives orange, yellow and blue gives green, etc. This means that the relationship between all colors that we see must be the same for all of us, which is highly unlikely if we saw colors differently.\n\nAll in all, the probability of all of us seeing colors differently is virtually non-existent.",
