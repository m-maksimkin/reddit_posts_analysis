            "text": "It is important to note that cave diving is not nearly as dangerous as it sounds, *if you are an experienced diver, trained to dive in overhead environments, staying within the limits of your training and breathing gas, and following all the rules of cave diving.*\n\nIf, however, you do not have training to dive in overhead environments, it can be extremely dangerous.\n\nBut typically speaking the dangers are way overblown here on places like Reddit simply due to the (truly frightening) potential for drowning underwater in the dark.\n\nAlso, each time a thread on cave diving comes up, there's always people who bring up the nutty putty incident, or the guy who tried to do a body recovery on someone like 500ft down (and the guy attempting the body recovery was the epitome of \"too far, too fast\" with his diving career).  Stories like that are *incredibly* rare.  The vast majority of cave dives are completely uneventful.\n\nSince the 1950s/1960s there have only been something like 500-600 deaths recorded in underwater caves.  Total, worldwide.  Granted, no one wants to be part of that statistic, but if you read the accident reports you start to see themes: basically all of them would qualify as \"dying while underwater in a cave\" rather than \"dying while cave diving\"....any scuba diver can wander into a cave.  But I don't think you can truly consider it \"cave diving\" unless you're trained and equipped to do it.  The accident reports are full of people who weren't trained for overhead environments so they didn't carry enough gas, didn't follow the main line, didn't have good buoyancy control, didn't carry at least 3 lights, didn't have redundant tanks, didn't practice non-silting kicks...the list goes on and on.\n\nCompare that number of deaths (500-600 people over the past 60+/- years) to nearly any other recreational activity and the numbers are incredibly low, and are much lower for fully trained cave divers.  To my knowledge there has only been a single death from someone who was fully trained and was correctly obeying all the rules of cave diving, and that was due to a cave-in (incredibly rare due to the nature of the cave passages being filled with water).\n\nUnderwater caves can be truly beautiful.  The water is usually crystal clear and your light will shine as far as your eyes can see.  The most popular caves are in Florida and Mexico, with a number of caves in various places in Europe.  Yes some caves don't have perfect visibility, and some are smaller, but some have water as clear as air, and have passages so wide you could fly an airliner through them.\n\nCave diving is the closest thing you can do to being an astronaut without actually going to space -- you're suspended in the water column not holding onto anything, it's dark, you're wearing lots of gear, it's an alien environment few people will ever experience, and your mind totally blocks out the outside world.  It's just you, your dive buddies, your gear, and the cave.  There's a feeling of exploration and wonder as you're there, wanting to see what's around the next corner.\n\n\nSide note: most people who are cave divers aren't adrenaline junkies.  Fuck things like skydiving...you'll never, ever see me jump out of a plane!",

            "text": "Reading \"American Caving Accidents\" gives some interesting insights as to the events that may lead to the death of a cave diver. They aren't all as \"linear\" as you might think. For example, an experienced cave diver died [when he took the wrong regulator in his mouth during decompression.](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/1996/165/5/diving-fatality-due-oxygen-toxicity-during) He had a cylinder of oxygen to help purge nitrogen from his system, but instead used the wrong regulator; at that depth, 100% oxygen quickly leads to convulsions and death. Resuscitation efforts were unsuccessful.\n\nSometimes undiagnosed medical events kill divers; an example would be a fellow exploring a flooded nickel mine who surfaced and almost immediately died. Autopsy revealed the diver had a pulmonary embolism from an undiagnosed lung tumor.\n\nSimply being unprepared is probably the most common cause; although perhaps less common than it was, people dive caves and have no concept of what they are getting into, such as the [father and son that died Christmas os 2013](https://diverswhowanttolearnmore.wordpress.com/2014/01/04/father-and-son-die-whilst-on-christmas-day-dive/) while trying out their brand-new SCUBA gear. FWIW, [Eagle's Nest has killed 11 divers.](https://old.xray-mag.com/content/eagles-nest-access-news)\n\nDeaths amongst those that have NSS certification in cave diving are relatively rare.\n\nEDIT: The first example I gave is wrong; that was not an incorrect regulator, that was a gas mix with too much oxygen (50%) at depth. The incident I was thinking of was in Diepolder, with [Italian cave diver Guido Gaudenzi](https://www.tampabay.com/archive/1999/04/28/mistake-costs-diver-his-life/) took the wrong regulator.\n\n> Gaudenzi took his with him. He was at the prearranged 120-foot decompression stop when the problems arose, the report said. He apparently switched mouth pieces and took a breath from the wrong tank, the report said. He immediately began convulsing. The regulator fell out of his mouth. His teeth clenched. Derksen and Roncoli swam to help their shaking partner, but it was too late.\n\n>At 120 feet under water, one deep breath of pure oxygen would shut a person's central nervous system off like a light switch, said Bruce Ryan, a cave diving specialist with the National Speleological Society.",

Compared to the average person on the street, you’re an expert now. You go diving on coral reefs, a few shipwrecks and even catch lobster in New England. You go to visit a deep spot like this and you’re having a great time. You see something just in front of you - this beautiful cave with sunlight streaming in - and you decide to swim just a little closer. You’re not going to go inside it, you know better than that, but you just want a closer look. If your dive computer starts beeping, you’ll head back up.\nSo you swim a little closer and it’s breathtaking. You are enjoying the view and just floating there taking it all in. You hear a clanging sound - it’s your dive master rapping the butt of his knife on his tank to get someone’s attention. You look up to see what he wants, but after staring into the darkness for the last minute, the sunlight streaming down is blinding. You reach to check your dive computer, but it’s a little awkward for some reason, and you twist your shoulder and pull it towards you. It’s beeping and the screen is flashing GO UP. You stare at it for a few seconds, trying to make out the depth and tank level between the flashing words. The numbers won’t stay still. It’s really annoying, and your brain isn’t getting the info you want at a glance. So you let it fall back on your left shoulder, turn towards the light and head up.\nThe problem is that the blue hole is bigger than anything you’ve even dove before, and the crystal clear water provides a visibility that is 10x what you’re used to in the dark waters of the St Lawrence where you usually dive. What you don’t realize is that when you swam down a little farther to get a closer look, thinking it was just 30 or 40 feet more, you actually swam almost twice that because the vast scale of things messed up your sense of distance. And while you were looking at the archway you didn’t have any nearby reference point in your vision. More depth = more pressure, and your BCD, the air-filled jacked that you use to control your buoyancy, was compressed a little. You were slowly sinking and had no idea. That’s when the dive master began banging his tank and you looked up. This only served to blind you for a moment and distract your sense of motion and position even more. Your dive computer wasn’t sticking out on your chest below your shoulder when you reached for it because your jacket was shrinking. You turned your body sideways while twisting and reaching for it. The ten seconds that spent fumbling for it and staring at the screen brought you deeper and you begin to accelerate with your jacket continuing to shrink. The reason that you didn’t hear the beeping at first and that it took so long to make out the depth numbers between the flashing words was the nitrogen narcosis. You have been getting depth drunk. And the numbers wouldn’t stay still because you are still sinking.\nYou swim towards the light but the current is pulling you sideways. Your brain is hurting, straining for no reason, and the blue hole seems like it’s gotten narrower, and the light rays above you are going at a funny angle. You kick harder and just keep going up, toward the light, despite this damn current that wants to push you into the wall. Your computer is beeping incessantly and it feels like you’re swimming through mud. Fuck this, you grab the fill button on your jacket and squeeze it. You’re not supposed to use your jacket to ascend, as you know that it will inflate itself as the pressure decreases and you will need to carefully bleed off air to avoid shooting up to the surface, but you don’t care about that anymore. Shooting up to the surface is exactly what you want right now, and you’ll deal with bleeding air off and making depth stops when you’re back up with the rest of your group.\nThe sound of air rushing into your BCD fills your ears, but nothing’s happening. Something doesn’t sound right, like the air isn’t filling fast enough. You look down at your jacket, searching for whatever the trouble might be when FWUNK you bump right into the side of the giant sinkhole. What the hell?? Why is the current pulling me sideways? Why is there even a current in an empty hole in the middle of the ocean??\nYou keep holding the button. INFLATE! GODDAM IT INFLATE!!\nYour computer is now making a frantic screeching sound that you’ve never heard before. You notice that you’ve been breathing heavily - it’s a sigh of stress - and the sound of air rushing into your vest is getting even weaker.\nEvery 10m of water adds another 1 atmosphere of pressure. Your tank has enough air for you to spend an hour at 10m (2atm) and to refill your BCD more than a hundred times. Each additional 20m of depth cuts this time in half. This assumes that you are calm, controlling your breathing, and using your muscles slowly with intention. If you panic, begin breathing quickly and move rapidly, this cuts your time in half again. You’re certified to 20m, and you’ve gone briefly down to 30m on some shipwrecks before. So you were comfortable swimming to 25m to look at the arch. While you were looking at it, you sank to 40m, and while you messed around looking for your dive master and then the computer, you sank to 60m. 6 atmospheres of pressure. You have only 10 minutes of air at this depth. When you swam for the surface, you had become disoriented from twisting around and then looking at your gear and you were now right in front of the archway. You swam into the archway thinking it was the surface, that’s why the Blue Hole looked smaller now. There is no current pulling you sideways, you are continuing to sink to to bottom of the arch. When you hit the bottom and started to inflate your BCD, you were now at 90m. You will go through a full tank of air in only a couple of minutes at this depth. Panicking like this, you have seconds. There’s enough air to inflate your BCD, but it will take two minutes to fill, and it doesn’t matter, because that would only pull you up to the top of the arch, and you will drown before you get there.\nHolding the inflate button you kick as hard as you can for the light. Your muscles are screaming, your brain is screaming, and it’s getting harder and harder to suck each panicked breath out of your regulator. In a final fit of rage and frustration you scream into your useless reg, darkness squeezing into the corners of your vision.\n4 minutes. That’s how long your dive lasted. You died in clear water on a sunny day in only 4 minutes.\n\nEDIT: I’m not author of the above. I saved it from another comment months/years ago because it haunted me. I’m sure if you Google around you could find the og comment.",

I was just giving what seemed to me to be the most obvious answer. In response to the most common replies: \n1. it doesn't matter if you can find your way out easily. You _still_ have to travel the same distance you went down _and_ the distance you traveled in the cave which is by necessity greater than if you could simply go up. \n2. It doesn't matter if you get the bends rising from 20m because you would _still_ have to travel back through the caves and then do the exact same rise and also get the bends.\n3. Yes there are many other dangers and concerns. See the referenced comment above.\n\nOriginal reply:\n\nIn open water if you're in trouble you swim up.\n\nIn a cave you would have to find your way back out, meaning it'll be a lot longer before you could surface even if you knew exactly how to get out.\n\nYou drive 20m down and swim horizontally for 500m, you're still only 20m from the surface. Swim down 20m to a cave and 500m in the cave, you're 520m from the surface.\n\nAdditionally it's easier to find the surface if all you do is need to go up.",

Unlike open water, you cannot swim up to safety. You have to solve your problem in place or be prepared to swim out, which can be several hundred yards or more.\n\n(2) Orientation is more challenging. There are no sources of natural light. There may be little or no water current to help you establish direction. You need to be extraordinarily competent with mental mapping and setting/following navigation lines and markers without getting tangled.\n\n(3) Cave dives are often significantly deeper and longer than a regular dive. We incur decompression obligations and have to manage our ascent/exit carefully so that we do not get the bends. We're typically using more than one gas mixture (blends of air, oxygen, and helium) and we have to use them properly. The wrong gas at the wrong depth can kill you in less than a minute.\n\n(4) Caves often have silty floors or muddy water. We have to move carefully and maintain impeccable technique to ensure that we don't cause a \"silt out\" (dust cloud) that obscures everything.\n\n(5) Our equipment is more complex. I carry a minimum of 2 of everything I need and 3 of anything that will save my life. My equipment for a cave dive weighs more than I do!",

Untrained OW divers will rototill with their fins pointed down and even if they're floating in the water column they'll be blowing out the viz behind them. If they're not neutral and they crash into the bottom then that's really going to blow the silt out there.\n\n>We're trained to know roughly what the failure rates and causes is of all our equipment and how to handle failures and emergencies under water. So we carry 3 lights and we have at a minimum dual tanks with full gas redundancy. We know the burntimes of our light and we plan our gas so that we have enough gas to both get us out and to exit with our buddy if they have a gas emergency.\n\n>We follow a line into and out of the cave, since different sections of the cave may look similar and since going out may look different than coming in and following the cave may be disorientating.\n\n>There's also just mentality which is taught. If you are back in a cave and have some kind of issue and stop and futz with it for 10 minutes then you're slowly dying. It can be better to make progress to your exit, while cleaning up your equipment on the move (or trying to figure out what to do about a failure). At the same time any failures that will slow down your exit you probably should stop and address (if you're 60 minutes back in a cave and you have some issue that will ultimately delay your exit by 10 minutes, its better to spend a minute or two to clean it up -- its also usually better not to stack up multiple failures you've ignored which is how you start to swirl around the incident pit).\n\n>We don't actually think about this all the time though or we wouldn't do it. You're trained to the point where all of this is just second nature and you just dive into the cave and enjoy it mostly.\n\n>What kills trained cave divers, though, is usually complacency of one form or another. For example there's the rule that you must have a continuous guideline to open water that is maintained at all times. Very often cave divers start to slack on this rule in caves they think they know and they start not running reel into the cave or start taking jumps from one line to another without putting in jump spools to maintain their continuous guideline. Eventually those rule violations will catch up to you (which is normalization of deviance\n).\n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thalassophobia/comments/84ncpo/sign_in_many_underwater_caves/dvrbvsb/",

Everyone's mentioned the general dangers pretty well so let me give why I didn't finish my certificate.\n\nI took a two week vacation to visit a still renown cave instructor.  Previously I had done cavern for a few years and even some wreck penetration, aka going into sunk ships.  Never so far that I couldn't reel my way out etc.  I've done some deeper dives and all in all consider myself a very safe diver who knows his bounds and doesn't push boundaries.\n\nAfter my first cert dive I was feeling good.  We checked in for the day after and I dropped my backup regulator(breathing mouthpiece) at a shop because it was having a very minor pressure issue after our dives.  I swapped to my instructors back up and was good.\n\n\nNext day arrives and it's perfect weather perfect water.   We get to site, I hook up my backups and take a quick breath underwater to make sure no more leak.  We're good across the board.  We sink ourselves down about 60 ft before the underwater caves entrance, it's about 8 ft wide and goes back 100 or so and doesn't feed into any cracks or holes you can get lost in.\n\n\nI go about twenty feet in and all of a sudden notice my regulators not giving me gas each breath.  I crank it up and nothing is like breathing through a pinched straw.  I grab my backup, take a breath and another and now I have some odd grease lining my mouth.  I kick forward and tug on my instructors fin, giving him some sign language he passes me his backup and I take a breath but panic is already screaming through my veins.  I signal to him, grab a backup bottle and ascended asap without thinking about how long I was down.\n\n\nI surface, take my gear off and explain what happens.  He disectrd my gear and my main appeared to have no issues, maybe a tiny bit cold but water was in 50s and it was not a cheap reg so probably not a freeze.  My octo had been maintenance and it appeared something was leftover somewhere or perhaps the new line.  I didn't care enough to find out and I quit diving then.  The instructor did take the gear and said he'd contact vendors if necessary etc.\n\nSo yea cave diving is crazy because so many things can go wrong, including yourself.

Big open caves no one has an issue with, it’s the tight caves where you can get your gear caught on rocky edges, kick up silt and lose visibility, etc that many of us tend to avoid. Same goes for wreck diving somewhat. Tight spaces and scuba diving = risk. \n\nI assume you’re talking scuba diving, which I was too, but for the sake of a personal story I’ll tell you about a time I did cave free-diving (no tank, just my lungs, mask and fins). I lived in Honduras from when I was 9-17, then moved home to Canada. About 10 years later I started going back to Honduras almost every year to visit my favourite place as a kid, Utila, one of the bay islands and known worldwide for being a scuba hotspot. It’s a tiny volcanic island about 9x3 miles. In the middle of the island are some freshwater caves. I visited them as a kid and many times now as an adult, crawling through a small hole and through many chambers, only a couple of which you can actually stand up in. At a certain point the cave ends and the only way to continue is underwater. A few years ago I started asking around about free-diving further into those caves, knowing that a fair number of people have died doing so, albeit mostly from attempting to scuba it. This one Belgian guy told me he’d done it and we could go dive it together. I didn’t even hesitate. I love those caves and needed to explore further. I’m indigenous Canadian and I know the stories of how the Paya “Indians” hid in those very caves on Utila when the Spanish came to essentially cull the island. I wanted to physically explore those stories deeper. I went with my friend, my fins and an underwater torch. We dove from chamber to chamber. He would go first, get to the next “checkpoint” and then signal me with his torch and I would hold my breath and swim to his location. At least twice I almost surfaced straight into sharp jagged volcanic rock. A couple inches one way and I could have sliced my head open, knocked myself unconscious and some of those checkpoints were like one square metre of exposed surface where we could breath, catch our breath and then dive to the next actual chamber. My mate would have been in a hell of a conundrum trying to either get help or get me out. \n\nI would never again in a million years do that dive. Of course I don’t regret it. But it was too dangerous and well outside my skill level. I’m not a great freediver, I just love doing it. I can last maybe a minute holding my breath while swimming. Any type of diving can be simultaneously very safe and very dangerous. Do things correctly and you can be safe even if everything goes wrong and all your equipment malfunctions. Do things incorrectly and you can be in danger even if only one thing goes wrong. This applies to every skill level of diver, but especially to less experienced ones. \n\nCave diving is no joke, but most of us will do the big wide open easy ones without a second thought.",

            "text": "Another Certified Cave diver here.\n\nWhenever someone asks a question about something being \"too dangerous\" I always like to start with the idea that \"danger\" is a sliding scale. Remember that while some people consider Cave Diving to be \"too dangerous\" someone else considers just SCUBA diving to be \"too dangerous\" and another person considers just getting in the ocean \"too dangerous\" because they just know they will get eaten by a shark and some people are just deathly afraid of water and will not get into a pool.   \n\nWhat is dangerous to me, may not be to you and vice versa. The major factor here is training. The vast number of cave diving deaths are from people who think they have the skills without the training and find out too late they don't.  \n\nFor example I do this dive called Eagles Nest (EN) [https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/accidents/man-dies-at-treacherous-eagles-nest-cave-diving-site-in-weeki-wachee/2308909/](https://www.tampabay.com/news/publicsafety/accidents/man-dies-at-treacherous-eagles-nest-cave-diving-site-in-weeki-wachee/2308909/)  \n\nNow EN is simply a serious cave. You go WAY past recreational diving limits (60 feet for OW) before you even hit the top of the debris field and you just reach the very top of the debris field at 120 feet which is the limit for Advanced certification.  And the entrance starts at 20 feet and you end up going 8-10 feet down a hole and then it opens to a gigantic room.  Before you get to the horizontal cave system you are already at 140 feet deep.   \n\nTo do this dive I had a set of doubles for my dive gas, two deco bottles, three lights, a dry suit, two computers, a set of written out dive tables, and even carried two masks. My dive gas was 12% O2 and 60% helium (because at 218 feet normal 21% air the O2 becomes toxic and at 150 feet the 70% nitrogen makes you act like you are drunk) But 12% O2 is not enough O2 on the surface so I had to have a transition gas to get to depth. I also had to have two deco bottles. So at the surface I would start diving a normal air bottle and then transition at about 100 feet to my back gas (12/60). On the way back I would transition back to that bottle to start my deco. I'd then switch to a 50% O2 at 50 feet, then at 20 feet I'd switch to 100% O2. My dive was down to 280 feet, I went about 700-800 feet downstream. My deco was well over an hour....  I have Cave certs, Normoxic and Hypoxic dive certs and before I tried this dive I had \\~100 cave dives. \n\nWhy mention this? Well, when my buddy and I pulled up there was another set of divers there. They had just gotten some gear for their birthday and wanted to \"test it out\". It was a new open water set, they were basic open water divers. They had ONE light for TWO people. Compare my set and training to theirs... It was still dangerous for me, it was suicide for them.  \n\nEagles Nest has been the site of 13 deaths.  But a lot of OW divers think they have the skills to tackle it. \n\nNow some OW divers hear of \"experienced\" divers dying in caves and consider it \"too dangerous\"... An open water instructor has zero business in a cave, they are considered experienced but they have no clue in that environment.   \n\nSome of the basic rules (excuse me, I am pulling from memory here): \n\n* Never exceed your training level. If you are not cave, don't go in a cave. If you do not have depth training, stick to recreational limits. The rest of these rules you learn in class).  \n* Always have a continuous line to the surface. We literally run a line from open water to any place we go (or there is a line there already). We also have these little markers that point to the nearest exit that we put on the line.  \n* Only use 1/3rd of your gas to go into the cave. Leave 1/3rd to get out and 1/3rd for an emergency.   \n* Carry three lights for cave and two for cavern.   \n\nFollow those rules  (especially training) and a simple cave is relatively safe. Ignore them and the easiest cave is \"too dangerous\".    \n\nThe same concept applies in other areas... I am also a skydiver with 7.5K jumps... We have some basic rules there as well and the danger level depends on who, the gear, and the training.",

There was one spot where it was open with a high “ceiling” and we could see a bit of light, but no way to climb up. We kept coming back to that spot. Eventually one of us figured out the way to get back. The guys I went with immediately wanted to go back in. I declined. I think we fashioned some rope or twine or something as a way to trace their way back and I have no idea how far they went the second time, but it was uneventful. \n\nNever again.

Folks with a ton of open water experience may become overconfident and do things they don't realize is dangerous, leading to accidents. These folks with 20+ years of open water diving are doing absolutely the right thing: they SHOULD refuse to cave dive without training.\n\nAs for more concrete reasons, here's the five rules of cave diving to give you an idea of the EXTRA challenges that diving in close spaces bring:\n\n1. Always use a continuous guideline to the surface.  \n2. Save two-thirds of the total air supply for returning to the surface.  \n3. Carry at least three lights during the dive.  \n4. Limit dive depth to that appropriate for the gas being breathed  \n5. Be well trained in cave diving and mentally prepared for the dive.  \n\n\nI.e: it's very easy to get lost. Cave systems are very difficult to navigate, and believing you can easily/quickly return from where you came from is a death trap. Cave systems have false exits. Unless you have a guide line, you may get the wrong way out and get trapped. Another main challenge is that cave systems cause silting if you don't move correctly. There's a way to use your fins to avoid it, but an untrained diver will raise a lot of silt and be completely blind. These accounts for rules 1,2,3: guide (you may go blind), backup air (you may get lost), and lights (there's no other light source). These guys dive with more backup systems for the same reason.\n\n4 is a little harder to explain, but it has to do with diving plans, air mixes, and the effect of diving on cognition. At some depths, I understand some level of impairment is unavoidable. Therefore planning and execution need to be decided ahead of time - because you'll not be making your best decisions. \"Plan the dive, and dive the plan\".\n\n5 is self-explanatory: there are extra things that are not issues in open-water diving - make sure you know and train for it.",

            "text": "Keep in mind, i'm not a diver so take this with a pinch of salt. I just watch and read a bit about diving since I want to do it some day. Diving on it's own is pretty dangerous, but before I explain the dangers, there are a few things to understand.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decompression sickness**\n\nWhen you're diving, you need to inhale pressurised air. If you were inhaling unpressurised air, you would be having to suck very hard to get it in your lungs, since the water would be squeezing your lungs, making it harder to expand them. That's why when you dive, you inhale pressurised air, it forces your lungs to expand, but causes your body to absorb the extra nitrogen. When you're at depth that's fine, but when you start surfacing, the pressure starts dropping, which causes the nitrogen to come out in bubbles. This is why you need to surface slowly when diving very deep. If you do it too fast, too many bubbles form and they clump together into larger bubbles. Effects are fatigue, muscle and joint pain, disorentation, paralysis, clouded judgement,... Fun fact, this also happens when you ascend in an unpressurised plane very quickly, since higher you go, less pressurised air is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Arterial air embolism/pulmonary barotrauma**\n\nWhen you're breathing at sea level, where air pressure is 1 bar (15 psi), your lungs can hold about 6 liters of air at max. For this example, let's say that when you breathe, you breathe in as much air as your lungs can hold to make it easier to understand. For every 10 meters (30 ft) you go down in water, the pressure increases by 1 bar. So at 10 meters, pressure would be 2 bar. At 90 it would be 10 bar. If you were to inhale air at that pressure to max out your lungs, you aren't actually inhaling 6 liters of air, you inhale 60 liters that's squished down to 6 liters by the water pressure. If you were to then hold your breath all the way from 90 meters to the surface (maybe gear failure or something), that air in your lungs would be expanding from it's pressurised state to it's unpressurised state (if that makes sence), and your lungs along with it. So if you were to not exhale at all douring that ascent, your lungs would expand to 10x their maximum capacity, so yeah. You can imagine what happens.\n\nBut in reality, that doesn't really happen, since we don't max out our lungs every time we inhale, so the effect is lessened. But it still happens. If you ascend too quickly, the air in your lungs expands, and if you're breathing slowly, which is a natural responce if you're running low on oxygen, it's even worsened.\n\nThis will cause pulmonary barotrauma, which is damage to lung tissue. Which is bad enough on it's own, but it can cause air to get in your arteries (called arterial air embolism), Which then blocks your blood from getting to your organs. Symptoms are much more sever than decompression sickness, and they are strokes (bubbles prevent bloodflow to brain), heart attacks (bubbles prevent bloodflow to heart), low blood pressure and everything that brings with it, difficulty breathing, joint pain, confusion and unconsciousness.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Nitrogen narcosis**\n\nWhen you are using a mixture of gasses, instead of pressurised air (which is necesary for deep dives), arround 30-40 meters (90-120 feet) nitrogen narcosis occurs. The severity varies from person to person. At best it has a calming effect and it makes you feel good and in control, which makes your threat recognisation harder. You might have something dangerous happen to you and you ignore the warning signs untill it's too late. At worse, it impairs your judgement, loss of direction, effects on your memory and worsens your motor skills. In worse cases, divers can't tie knots or locate valves on your gear. On it's own that's not that bad, but you can see why it can cause bigger problems.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Closed circuit system rebreathers (CCR)**\n\nClosed circuit rebreathers allow long dives and produce no bubbles. Closed circuit rebreathers supply two breathing gases to the loop pure oxygen and a dilutent. It basically filters out carbon dioxide from your exhaled breath which still contains alot of oxygen, from what I understand. Oxygen is then added to replenish the oxygen you used up. If your dive computer or rebreather malfunctions, it can cause multitude of effects, main ones being hypercapnea (too much carbon dioxyde inhaled) which causes anxiety, headaches, sleepyness, shortness of breath, and oxygen intoxication (too much oxygen inhaled), which causes caughing, dyzzyness, troubled breathing, nausea, muscle cramping,...\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**So, now to the fun part. Why is deep diving so dangerous. Keep in mind these are just a few examples and most common ones.**\n\n1. Something happens and you need to surface quickly. Doing it too fast causes decompression sicnkness, who's symptoms can be more easly managed in open water. But it can cause pulmonary barotrauma you pass out, spit out your regulator and you die.\n2. You get nitrogen narcosis, which clouds your judgement, you panick and surface too quickly, the prevous happens and you die.\n3. Your gear malfunctions, you get too much CO2 or oxygen and the first thing happens and you die.\n4. Unexpected physical problems such as COPD can make pulmonary barotrauma, nitrogen narcosis and CCR malfunctions worse.\n5. There are other risks such as getting tangled in nets, currents, injuries (such as coilliding with boats), kicking up mud and getting disoriented, but since you are in open water, the way out is very simple; swim up, which also makes rescuing and help much easier. If you get caught in a current, it might sweep you away from your intended dive spot or in the open sea, but you still have to only swim upwards to prevent or atleast delay death.",
