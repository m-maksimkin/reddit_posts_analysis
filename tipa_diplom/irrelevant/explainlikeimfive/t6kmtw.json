Centralized banks are the biggest scam in all of history. \n\nWhen the printing press was invented it enabled a new reality for banks. Instead of just putting gold or silver in a bank and the bank paying you interest, there was a new reason, security.\n\nPretend you are a farmer and you go into town on a Saturday to sell potatoes at a market. The trip home was risky because bandits might rob you. The printing press provided a solution with bank notes. You would deposit gold, silver, whatever even jewelry and the bank could give you a form of receipt with a serial number that was recorded. If your paper money was robbed, you could report the theft and the bank could cancel the note, and give you a new one.\n\nIn time, this created a new situation. Instead of trading coin directly after cashing notes at the bank, people began to trade the notes. The obvious threat here would be if you gave, say the local butcher a $20 note and then reported it stolen you could scam him - but it would only work once and now your bank refuses you and the local butcher refuses you, so the system worked well.\n\nFast forward a bit and the banks realize that only about 10 percent of the gold “reserve” is ever withdrawn. Meaning the banks realized they could print extra paper bills and loan them out - and the public would never know.\n\nNow you have a situation where instead of loaning out deposited money at say 10% interest and getting a return of 10% they could loan out 10x what value they actually held and charge 10% interest.\n\nOvernight banks figured out a way to multiply wealth like had never existed in all of human history. There was no other industry in say 1600 that could multiply its wealth at no relevant cost to the tune of 100% + profits and keep rolling it over.\n\nFractional reserve banking is this process of only having a small percentage of value in reserve to back the circulating currency.\n\nLoaning money at interest was a sin under the Catholic Church, so only Jews were allowed to do this resulting in a monopoly on an industry. \n\nEventually with industrialization changing warfare with cannons and guns you HAD to industrialize as a nation in order to defend yourself from your European neighbours. Where would investment money come from? Enter fractional reserve currencies. If a country converted to a paper based currency the state could print money to pay for war. As industry advanced ware fare, banks were given control of the money. \n\nWhen the United States was founded the power to issue currency was granted to congress, so profit within the banking sector was essentially reinvestment in the lower cost of government. Eventually banks after a few attempts were able to co opt the entire government system by getting corrupt representatives to pass the federal reserve into existence and seize control of the money supply.\n\nThis system is basically mirrored the world over. Now government instead of issuing its own money to finance borrows from a bank, unnecessarily, at interest to pay for government- an absolutely parasitic scam on the taxpayer. Most nations income tax actually goes to paying the interest on the debt, and doesn’t even pay for the actual cost of government which comes from property tax etc. It was literally designed to destroy the middle class.\n\nOh, also when the federal reserve was created as a private corporation 10 shares were sold to anonymous buyers. The charter creating the bank legalized fractional reserve banking of a factor of 10x what was held in reserve. The US government bought the first share at $2 million dollars and then the bank LOANED OUT the money to the other 9 secret (read Rothschild) shares.\n\nSo the US taxpayers funded 100% of the upstart cost but then gets 10% of the profit. You literally can’t make this stuff up, the largest scam in all of history, ever, in any sector.\n\nIt’s boring but I promise you that a solid understanding of the history of fractional reserve currencies will be the single greatest illumination on history you have ever had.\n\nThis movie is an absolutely phenomenal watch, likely the most important single movie documentary subject of all time.\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bm6oeRgxs0A",

The whole system is designed around people investing money into businesses and other people and then being rewarded so they can use that money to then invest in more businesses and people. Banks loan money to businesses and individuals so they are big investors and since the whole system is designed to reward investment, they make a lot of profit. If you look at the richest people in the world they are people who have invested heavily into a business or multiple businesses, you don't get rewarded in capitalism for producing, you get rewarded for investing.  That's why they are rich despite not producing. Socialism is centered around production, capitalism is centered around investment.\n\nEDIT: as for how the money is actually made, they earn interest on loans and they also invest the money you out in your bank account. They don't keep your money in a vault, if you put 1,000 in the bank, they will take that money and put it on the stock market, or angel investing or loan it out and all of that makes profit.\nThat's why if everyone tries to take their money out of the bank at once the bank goes bust and people lose their money because the money isn't there, it's been invested.

This is because they perform a service where they get buy stuff from producers and get them available to you the consumer. Yeah you could buy them from a factory directly, but most factories can't be bothered to deal with the hassle of dealing with customers and small scale purchases; they would rather work in bulk with reliable clients (retail shops).\n\nNow imagine that instead of keeping your money as physical cash in your home, which can be a risk and very inconvenient. You take your money to a central location where other people have money and they keep track it for you. So when you buy or sell something, instead of physically handing over a bag of cash, you go to the central location and tell them to move the cash there where it is safe. This is basically the function of bank.\n\nNow the bank charges you monthly, or for every transaction a little bit of money. Yes they don't produce anything, but basic commerce requires lots of transactions, and with a small payment from each they end up becoming a lot money. Now the bank has it's own money. It can use this money to do things like give out loans, credit, buy and sell things. So from their primary function of handling people's many and transactions of them, makes them money, and they can use this money to do thing.\n\nNow when you take out your VISA or whatever credit/debit card, you don't pay transaction fees. The company that receives your payment does. This is why some services let you buy cheaper if you buy with credit or direct deposit, this is because it cheaper for them, they save the transaction fee.\n\nNow small banks don't actually have or make that much money. World is filled with small banking institutions and credit unions that basically intentionally make just bit more than enough to stay afloat.\n\nBut the big banks that you mention, they don't just handle storing of money and wealth. They also handle credit, trades, insurances investments, insurances. They have a massive porfolio or services that they act as primary provider or a middle hand of. Example in a big bank, there can be numerous smaller companies (subsidiaries) like funds or credit providers that handle speciality tasks. The bank provides infrastructure for them to operate, maybe some liquidity and assets, and then this company pays them back profits.\n\nSo a bank makes money the same way a courier service or a supermarket does.

That will include bankers, money lenders, money changers, escrow agents etc.\n\nI'll also expand \"produce\" to \"add value\". As other have pointed out bankers provide services, not goods.\n\nIt's actually an open question if FSPs provide value or not. One theory says that they add value in the form of things like liquidity, information generation, financial advising etc. The argument is that the service they provide is making other businesses more efficient. If that's true it's certainly worth something but we're also not sure exactly how much it's worth in practice.\n\nAn other theory says that when economies get big enough FSPs will just show up to take advantage of all the money floating around. This essentially says that FSP either don't add value or add less value than they cost.\n\nEconomists have argued theories in both directions but they haven't been able to test it. If you just look at historical records you see economies and FSPs rising together. That makes it hard to figure out which causes which. You also can't really run an experiment because no country in the world will let you just turn FSPs on and off to see what happens.\n\nThe question of why the got so rich is because that's their business. Who is possibly going to be better at making money than someone who's entire business is nothing but money?

If it does, great, the bank gets paid back with some interest, if not, they get to keep some/all collateral that was a part of the loan agreement and they will get paid back over decades with interest.  Back in the royalty days, they might get some sort of lordship title. So now the banks got the goverment where they want them. They convince the goverment that they, the government, can't be trusted to print its own money, but instead, it has to borrow all money, at interest, from the banks. Knowing that you will have to pay it off will force you to make wiser choices, but the fun part is, the bank, just makes the money out of thin air, and collects interest on which is primarily paid by the common people. Again, like royalty, they have written laws to ensure they can never go broke.  People will say it is a service, it provides liquidity and all that bullshit.

            "text": "Surprised at the lack of mention of fractional reserve banking here, considering that it's pretty much what makes modern banks (and by extension, bank owners) rich. \n\nBasic banking is just taking money from some people with the promise of growing it. This is done by lending it out to people who promise to return it with interest. \n\nStill with me so far? In a normal bank you'd maybe take $1000 each from John, Peter and Paul for a total of $3000 to give out to other people. But if you give out that $3000, then if one or all of them suddenly come around to withdraw some of their money you wouldn't have any to give out, right? This is where fractional reserve banking comes in. \n\nSee, what banks have been doing for a long time now is that they lend out their money but keep a fraction of it in reserve (hence the name), while *telling* the people who have stored their money in the bank that they can still withdraw it *at any time*. So in the previous example, the banks might lend out $2500 and keep $500 in reserve, but still tell John, Peter and Paul that they each have $1000 in the bank and can just withdraw it whenever they feel like it. They determine how much to keep in reserve by basically calculating the likelihood that a certain number of people will withdraw a certain amount of money. And then when the debtors pay them pack with interest, they've basically managed to make a profit off of money that technically doesn't exist.\n\nBut isn't that basically producing money from thin air? Um, yeah, it kind of is. Isn't that kind of risky if people decide to withdraw en-masse (this is called a bank run) only to find out that there isn't actually enough money in the bank? Yes, it also is. But it's kept manageable because of the math that comes in to determine the amount to keep in reserve. After all, if each individual is still able to withdraw a certain amount of their savings, then for them the savings might as well look intact, right?\n\nThis kind of hocus pocus that goes on with money is one of the reasons that I never pursued a career in finance or sales, because I wouldn't be able to condone deceitful practices like this. Proponents of this have argued that it creates prosperity and is a powerful driving force behind the wealth of some nations. I just think it's evil.",

            "text": "I think most of these answers miss the key point of *why* bankers are so much richer than your average joe and instead simply explain how they are making money.\n\n\n\n**Money is used to make money**. If you don't learn this concept, 99% chance you will be slaving away financially for the rest of your life unless you get really lucky or are in a lucrative enough line of work.\n\n\n\nSimply \"producing\" things is very difficult to become rich with. For the most part, it scales linearly and is very hard to increase. Think of your everyday salaryman. Let's suppose they make $40 per hour. He doesn't really have much way to increase his earnings from continuing to \"produce\" at the company, unless he gets a promotion/raise. All he can do is continue to slave away, waiting for each new day so that he can get more of the same fixed salary.\n\nSo what is one to do? How do you break free from this fixed time-based earnings slavery? How do you make vastly more money than anyone could \"produce\" in 1 hour? *How do you transcend the limits of time?* The answer is by using money instead of time. You may have heard that \"time is money\". This is true for average people. For the bankers and other rich people, **money is time**. Leveraging money allows you to scale up and make exponentially more money than your everyday salaryman could hope to make by \"producing\" in the same amount of time. \n\n\n\nLet's come back to the investment bankers. In its simplest form, they use their available money to buy/invest in things, which then get sold for a higher amount later. If they make say, a 10% profit from a $10 million initial investment over a total period of 3 months, they have just made $1 million in less than a year. And the more money these bankers are able to invest, the more absolute money they are able to make. It scales exponentially. Now that they have $11 million to invest, they reinvest it, and so on, causing it to snowball. An ordinary salary worker could never hope to match this earnings capability. The investment banker may not be themselves producing, but rather they are leveraging the production of entire corporations that they invest in with their money. The same is true of just about any rich person. A CEO leverages the production of all their employees.",

In exchange, they take a portion of the money that is deposited and loan it out to people, who then pay them back slightly (or substantially) more (that extra amount is interest). \n\nBanks that have more deposited money can give out more loans, and make more money. Making more money allows them to open more branches, and therefore make more money. So, the big banks, are naturally going to get bigger since smaller banks are going to be hard pressed to compete. \n\nMany of these banks are also in financial services, not just direct banking. One thing JP Morgan does is provide investment services. So, they are taking a portion of trades. If the stock market dips, it usually causes more sales, meaning more money for them. They also invest other people's money, not theirs and take a portion of the investment, not the performance - so it's again, just size that matters. \n\nA few things to note: Banks are a service industry. Much of the US economy is actually in the service industry, not producing physical things.

            "text": "First two corrections:\n\n1. Rockefeller was not a banker.  He made his fortune in oil.\n2. When JP Morgan died it was discovered he was not uber rich like the peers of his age.  He was just good at parleying his banking connections and assets to make it look like he was uber rich.  He was flexing so he could be the banker for the uber rich but he himself  was the next tier (or two tiers?) down in wealth.\n\nThe Rothschilds are the only people I know who got uber wealthy banking from a long time ago that is still around.  I got to give you some some set up.  During the Napoleonic Wars nations where borrowing money like mad (to give you perspective, the UK only finished paying off that war debt in the last 15 years on a war that happened 100 years before WW2).  They even gave out IOUs to soliders in lieu of pay.  Basically this war debt went up and down in value based on how war the was going.  The Rothschilds were already rich at the time of the Napoleonic Wars and were doing well from financing the wars of various nations.  What shot them to epic wealth is they had bought a lot of government debt during the war when people thought the Britain might loose, and sold it later after the war when deeply slashed government spending was maximizing need for safe debt to invest in.\n\nNow another correction.  A lot of these billionaire \"bankers\" you hear about now a days are not bankers.  They work outside the banking system in the more general financial system of which the banking system is just part of the whole.  From this point on I will call them \"financiers\"\n\n**How financiers become overnight billionaires is by \"arbitrage\".  Arbitrage in finance is when you find a way to get an asset or liability treated as though it is a better asset or liability by either investors or the government.**\n\nLet me give you an example of a common form arbitrage.  Pension funds are funds that people have invested in for retirement.  The thing about pension funds is that they are often under strict rules from their investors on what they can invest in.  People don't want their money for retirement to disappear.  They like safe investments.  But safe investments pay garbage and managers of the pension aren't going to get fat bonuses at the end of the year if  they stick to what is normally available.  They many not even keep the pension fund liquid.\n\nTo the \"rescue\" come the financiers.  They find ways to turn assets the pension fund is not allowed to own (and thus pay more interest) and turn them into assets the pension fund can buy.  They do this buy bundling risky assets together, buying some default insurance, giving then assets to a shell company, and then selling bonds that have first right to cash flow to all those risky assets.  The end result is something that pays like half a percent to 2 percent more than the traditional low risk assets.\n\nTo grant perspective, the California State Teachers' Retirement System is worth $254.7 billion.  If just that pension fund invests just $100 billion in your new asset you are looking at a commission of like $500 million.  And the pension fund is glad to play your commission because this will result in like $1 billion more in earnings every year.  Additionally you will still be managing this shell company for the rest of its existence and will be collect an annual fee to manage those assets every year of tens of millions a year.  And this shell company only takes like $200k to run a year.  Maybe some offices, a secretary, and lawyer on retainer.",

The primary revenue for banks is the difference between those two rates. So, say a bank can borrow money at a 2% rate and they can lend that money out at a 5% rate, that bank will earn 3% in revenue on that money.\n\nBanks operate on two primary principles: using economies of scale to lower their \"cost of funds\" (they price they pay for borrowing money) and being careful about who they lend money to (this process is called \"credit risk management\"). First, banks have the benefit of economies of scale. Banks borrow lots of money and that scale allows them access to cheaper sources of money than a smaller borrower can get. Second, banks are very careful about who they lend money to as if that borrower doesn't pay the bank back, the bank loses the money they leant. \n\nOf course, I'm dramatically oversimplifying all of this \n\nI take issue with the idea that bankers don't \"produce anything\" and therefore aren't adding value to a society. Credit and liquidity are both critical features of a strong economy. If someone has a good idea, they usually need money to execute on that idea. An orderly, well regulated banking industry is generally effective in that regard. Banks are experts at \"picking winners\" and funneling money to the best ideas. This is of course far from perfect, but in general banks that make bad bets don't stay in business very long. It's in their interest to lend money to good bets.

These are the people that work 100 hour weeks, particularly the juniors. This group are typically paid more money than in group 2, in part because of the hours.\n\n2) when trading occurs in securities that already exist (e.g. buying apple shares), the bank earns a commission. In some of the less commonly traded stuff, the traders/sales teams often have specific investors they work a lot with and so they know who to talk to if they’re looking to sell (or buy) something unusual.

You might already have some money, but if not, someone else must give it to you.  Of course you might now be able to give it back, so the other person charges you for the use of their money - this is called interest, literally because the other person is interested in the money they gave you.  \n\nSecondly, banks make very little money, in a way.  Now that you're up and running in business you might be buying and selling hundred or thousands of dollars every day.  In a year or two you could have a business worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  But all your bank has earned is a few per cent of the money they originally lent you.  If you did badly, they might make a big loss.

Those are enormous figures but they are literally about 1% of the compensation of top hedge fund managers: Israel Englander made an estimated $3.8 *billion* last year; Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies made about $2.6 billion, close to 100x the pittances that those serfs merely running the C-suites were getting.\n\nWhy such an enormous difference between mere bankers and equity owners?\n\nPartly it's for the same reason that top sales people in midsized businesses can make as much or more than the CEO: They aren't really paid a salary or even stock awards based on company performance (which is the bulk of CEO pay).  Hedge fund managers have the market power, or simply the connections, to demand what is more akin to both a cut off the top plus commission-based compensation.\n\nPartly it's because of the power of leverage, though of course this is a double-edged sword.  Works great when the economy is roaring or even just stable, though.  If you have $100 and invest it in something that goes up 50% in value, you've made $50.  If you have $100 and use that as collateral to borrow $1000 and then invest that in something that goes up 50% in value, you've made $500 less whatever interest you had to pay for the loan, which means your original $100 has grown to $600.  And that's just at 10-to-1 leverage.  Prior to the Great Recession, some financial firms were leveraged closer to 50-to-1.",

Also, I think there are some misconceptions to clear up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"became the richest people around\"\n\n\\-yes, bankers are very rich, but generally, they aren't the \"Richest\". If you look at this list: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\\_of\\_richest\\_Americans\\_in\\_history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_richest_Americans_in_history), the richest individuals are usually people like Carnegie (steel), Vanderbilt (railroads), Ford (automobiles), and Rockefeller (oil). Mellon is sort of an exception, but generally speaking, the richest people are the ones who actually create something, and the financial services also gets quite rich by taking a cut.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Jp Morgan, Rockefeller, rothschilds etc.\"\n\nThe main thing to point out here is that Rockefeller did not make his fortune in banking. He made his fortune in oil refineries, but pointing out how these individual people got rich:\n\nRothschilds -> a family of businessmen who made loans to warring states. In my opinion, the main distinction of the Rothschilds is that they were heavily focused on accumulating generational wealth, and that compounded over time leads to a vast fortune.\n\nJP Morgan -> his fortune generally arose by having a heavy stake in the railroad industry. JP Morgan took a bunch of smaller, failing railroad companies, consolidated them, and created a railroad monopoly. Other exploits (US Steel and GE) also had similar monopoly building aspects. Of note here is that while he was indeed a banker, and it certainly helped to have a pool of capital to draw from, his fortune wasn't really made collecting loan interest, so much as it was having a heavy stake in a rapidly growing industry.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRockefeller -> not a banker, but certainly rich. Rockefeller made his fortune by creating an oil refinery empire. He definitely had a lot of financial savvy, but I wouldn't consider him a banker.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"how do bankers make money\"\n\nThe loan part is touched upon by other posts, but what a \"banker\" does nowadays is usually different from what the \"really rich people\" you mentioned did to earn their fortunes. -Anyways, here are what I'd say are the ELI5 of different types of banking:\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRetail banking:  \n\\-exactly what everyone else says, collect deposits and give out loans. The largest market here I believe is home loans (mortgages), as well as auto loans.\n\nCommercial banking:\n\n\\-pretty much retail banking but for businesses. It's more varied here on the different types of loans, but one example is getting a loan to start up a business. If you want to start a bakery, you'd need a few 100k to buy the equipment, pay employees, pay rent, etc.\n\nInvestment banking:\n\n\\-when people think of \"rich bankers\", i think this is what they usually refer to. Investment bankers help companies (typically larger corporations) structure deals. For example, when corporation A wants to acquire another corporation B (this is generally called a Merger and Acquisition), they have to figure out logistics, like how much should corporation A pay to acquire corporation B. Investment bankers step in and help that process happens by collecting the necessary financial data, creating the models, etc. After the deal is finished, investment bankers take a fee for doing this. Because these deals are generally quite large (billions of dollars is pretty standard), even a small cut of that could easily mean 10s of millions of dollars.\n\nMaybe not the strictest analogy, but think of investment bankers as lawyers, except instead of specializing in the law, they specialize in financial figures. You are paying for their expertise in financial matters.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"when they don't really produce anything\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRetail banking/Commercial banking:\n\nCarnegie would not have been able to create steel factories without the capital to do so. Railroads would not have been created without banks. Without loans, many families would have to wait well into their 50s before buying a house. Think of loans as providing value in the dimension of time instead of the dimension of space. By paying a small fee each year, families can live in a house they own 30 years earlier (if you consider the fact that families have to pay rent if they don't own the home, many families would NEVER be able to own a house without loans).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvestment banking:\n\nI think it's clear to see the value here for corporations. Corporations want financial expertise, investment bankers provide that financial expertise. Maybe not so much value for the individual though, but that's up for you to decide.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"richest people\"\n\nIn general, the richest people you mentioned, and most extremely wealthy people in history, tend to make their fortune by having a sizable stake in a rapidly growing sector. In the heyday, this was oil (rockefeller), railroads (JP Morgan), steel (carnegie). Nowadays, that same sector is tech (steve jobs, bill gates, bezos, etc.). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe advantage of banking/financial services is that it may not be \"THE\" sector to be in, but it's always going to benefit from a general rising sector.",

The 'working class' are defined by their incoming being predominantly from their labor.\n\nMoney from money (capital gains). In simplist terms this is money you get from loaning money (value added from the risk of debt). This can be done at an individual or business entity level. \n\nFor example\nYou can buy tools at the risk you will find enough labor to profit from that investment.\n\n you can buy a house and rent it and make money on the risk the house doesn't get damaged and the renters pay on time.\n\nYou can buy a stock (piece of a company) at the risk that the company must continue growing, and your reward is equal to how much of the company you own\n\nNow let's think of a bank. What do they do? They hold our money in a secure location where it is insured, so you can rely your money is accessible. It is a required service for a functioning modern society. But we dont really pay for that service do we(a lot of banks wave fees for a minimum balance at least)? Its weird to get something for free so we know that the banks are doing something else for income (besides charging poor people for being poor - over draft fees)\n\nTheir second income is all based on \"having money to make money\" but its your money all of our money they're risking, and they have A LOT OF IT. \n\nNow that is a valuable service that helps grow the economy, but there is a MAJOR issue with this. When an economy makes much more money from money, than labor gains (money makes more money than the value of money produced by labor) then people (or banks/business entities) with money will take more of the value of that economies money.\n\nSo if the value of an economy's money was a pie, and money makes more money than labor, more and more of that pie goes to fewer people. Which means more people have less to eat.\n\nTl;DR: because it takes money to make money, people with money make more money than people working for their money. \n\nIf we think of money as a pie, banks keep getting a bigger slice every year, which means people who work for their money have less of the pie to eat.",

And that's why each level is richer than the level above it.  \n\n\n1) contestant in a competition: where you perform works in hope of may or maybe not get money payment at a later time.\n\n2) individual contributor: where you output service as a worker and get money payment at later time. If you're really good independent contractor you could get half pay up from and half when finish the job. But essentially you're selling time upfront and get paid in money later.  \n3) manager/business owner: you get payment first, then you rendering the service. You delegate works to workers. Buying back time with money. Since as an owner, you only have the same 24 hours as your worker, so you have to spread out the task. At this level, you're getting paid upfront and rendering the service. Most producer and manufacturer fall under this category.   \n4) Bank: The service you're providing is help other people to making more money. Earning money with other people's money. Unit margin is extremely low, after the first customer, the cost of servicing an additional customer is almost negligible. There is almost no input cost unlike a business that need to buy raw material, or upstream supplier, so can scale to enormous size with very little additional cost. Big tech follow similar pattern, high fixed cost but almost zero variable cost, so can scale to very size while maintain high margin.  \nAnd the fact that you only need to keep 20% reserve, every $1 is effectively $5 pull from the future at discount rate. So in a weird way, you getting paid from the future money, and perform the service at a later date. At this level they are buying other business's ability to buy time bank.\n\n5) insurance company: People pay you an insurance premium now, and some times in the future you may or may not payout. So getting paid first, then may or may not have to rendering the service at a later date. So service cost pretty much 0 in the short term, all the capital can be allocate to acquire customer. Insanely profitable business. Bank at least have to pay interest rate as service, but insurance company literally just take money and do nothing in the short term. A complete opposite paradigm from competition contestant, where they have to render service first and may or may not get a reward back. Where as in insurance, you get paid first, and may or may not have to render service later.  \n\n\n This is why tech company know that competition is the cheapest way to get good product and service for the least amount of cost.

I'll add a few things to sort of highlight banking here\n\n-At least in the U.S. you have federal incentives to borrow money. The interest payment on debt is tax deductible for businesses. It's the government's way of helping current entrepreneurial interests and start new ones. And people on average in the U.S. tend to stay with their banks for 10 years. Why leave perfectly okay Bank ABC when they give you the loans you want? Bankers establish relationships with borrowers and borrowers are incentivized to borrow regularly and don't want to ruin established relationships with their lenders/bankers\n\n-Politicians are ultimately subservient to money. Bankers control money in their local communities and most bankers, believe it or not, are heavily involved in their community's lives and developments. It gives bankers doorways into favorable lending arrangements and various favored political statuses. The Rothschilds were famous for financing almost all of the Battle of Waterloo and the Medici family held the Catholic Church's accounts and the Pope's personal accounts for a time. Having good social connections matter in banking. \n\n-Compounding interest is a massive force that is fortunately/unfortunately (depending on where you are in the arrangement) misunderstood. It's great when your investments have compounded interest but it's a bitch when your debt has compound interest.\n\n-These families wrapped their entire identities around banking and money. The Rothschilds especially were famous for having arranged marriages with first and second cousins to keep family ties in house. There were deliberate attempts at making sure their families and banking were talked about in the same sentence. The Chandler banking family in Kansas is the same as well.",

You have to stretch the loan across 30 years in order to get the monthly payment down to $700/month.\n\nThe interest rate is 4% which sounds very good, except...it's 4% per year on the remaining balance. If 4% of $100k is $4000, then you spread that across 12 months a year, so the interest the first year is $333/month. Once you subtract $333 interest, $150/mo property tax, and $150/mo homeowners insurance, the $700 payment only sends $67/month to the $100K principal.\n\nAfter the first year, $67 x 12 months is $800 away from the principal, so you now owe $99,200\n\nIf you borrow $100K and pay it back over 30 years, you will pay back around $300K, for a bank profit of $200K. If you fall behind on the payments, they evict you, take possession, and auction the house off.\n\nThe loans are actually \"amortized\", which means there is more interest in the beginning, and less interest near the end, on a sliding scale. This way the payment stays the same, even though the \"balance owed\" keeps going down.\n\nNow recalculate all these numbers for an \"average\" small house of $300K.\n\nAlso, the big banks invest in the stock market. They can bet that a stock will go up, and they can also bet that a stock will go down. The best thing for the economy is a slow and steady growth in the stock market. The profitable thing for banks is a constant up and down fluctuation in the stocks. Banks make political campaign donations.",

How? \n\nA. Well, when they lend your \n$100 to someone they charge \nhim interest. \n\nQ. How much? \n\nA. It depends on the Bank Rate. \nSay five and a-half per cent. \nThat's their profit. \n\nQ.

No. Because if you remove it \nthey can't lend it to anyone else. \n\nQ. But if I wanted to remove it \nthey'd have to let me? \n\nA. Certainly. \n\nQ. But suppose they've already \nlent it to another customer? \n\nA. Then they'll let you have \nsomeone else's money. \n\nQ. But suppose he wants his too \n... and they've let me have it? \n\nA.

Even as someone coming from a leftist perspective it is important people understand the function of a bank in an ideal sense and why that is useful in a society, (even if they dont always live up to this ideal):\n\nA bank is at its core just another kind of investor, and the money they make is from betting on the right business or people by lending them money. They take a cut only when they bet right, and so the service they provide is in finding the right people to make bets on. The thing they \"produce\" is research into the likelihood that these bets are worthwhile. Since societies don't have unlimited resources, this means that in any kind of society (capitalist, socialist, what have you) you are going to need somebody whose job it is to do research into investments and determine if they are worth putting money into. Even in centrally planned communism, someone somewhere needs to decide if the guys wanting to spend resources on a railroad or the guys wanting to spend resources on a apple slicing machine are more likely to give valuable returns. In a lot of ways that is everybody's job in most societies, but bankers do it with a particular pool of money and in special ways.\n\nThe difference between a banker and the investors you think of when you think \"investor\" is that a bank is a lot more conservative traditionally than an individual might be. They are more willing to make bets on things which can offer collateral, meaning they can get something out if the bet goes bad, and they are likely to focus on particular areas like house loans or something which they can distill down into key variables for determining whether a loan is likely to succeed or not.

So instead, you give him 8 notes for 1/16th of your wheat next year. The blacksmith keeps some for himself, and gives some to other people for supplies to make your tool. \n\nThis works kind of ok in a small village where you all know each other.

Someone might lie about being able to produce what they promise. Etc, etc….\n\nSo instead of each person making their own notes, everyone in the surrounding villages goes and finds one trustworthy enough person to make a single note for everyone.

So basically if you take a loan you need to spend the next 15 years paying back, you then win the lottery that would let you pay it back all in one go? You won't be allowed to do that because its illegal.that's right you gotta wait 15 years to pay it back, and you better not have any financial problems during those 15 years otherwise they're gonna take everything you own and you might even go to jail.\n\nThe above four put banks in very advantageous positions to easily make a lot of money with little to no risk, superficially it might seem like they're getting money out of thin air but that's not the case, a small fee here, a small investment there and you have yourself a pile of money to pay bankers.",

Banks help by providing loans, facilitating complex transactions between faraway parties, handling risk in the form of insurance and hedging, all things one person or industrial firm aren’t capable of.  They get paid for that.\n\n2.)  Banks know lots of people.  These friendships open doors other people don’t have available.  Due to all the business that banks do in different places, they become aware of huge money making opportunities before others do and can capitalize on it.  How JP Morgan did with Thomas Edison back in the day.\n\n3.)  Banks are usually started by people who are already rich and powerful as a social service.  It takes money to run a bank and the easiest way to get that money is to have earned it elsewhere.  Many people site the collection of interest on loans vs. deposits as the primary earning method of banks but neglect to mention how slow and risky that is to accumulate wealth.  The truth is most all banks have an origin that involves one or many wealthy people establishing a bank as a service to their community to help make people’s lives easier.  It’s why you see banks called names like “Chemical Bank” or “Community Bank.”  \n\n4.)  It’s a lie that you need to “produce” to earn money or grow wealthy.  This comes from cultures founded in rural or labor societies where their money came from what they produced.  These societies tended to be poor and couldn’t quite understand how it was that rich people could be so rich.  Education was hard to come by if you weren’t rich.  This made them easy to manipulate for political reasons and so propaganda started this narrative that non-producing professions were unethical and damaging to society.\n\n5.)  The people you named didn’t become wealthy because they were bankers.  They were bankers because they were wealthy.  The Morgan family was already quite wealthy and established before they became bankers and JP Morgan was following in his father’s banking footsteps.  I believe their family made their money owning factories or in shipping, can’t remember.  Rockefeller made his money in lamp oil then gasoline.  The Rothschilds were goldsmiths back in medieval Europe.  They provided an essential service of melting and reforming gold for others convenience.  An essential service they provided was storing that gold safely so others could come and get it when they needed instead of having to constantly carry it around.\n\nSo, you see, it’s the wealth that comes first.  Bankers aren’t special.  They’re just the spoke in the economic wheel so it seems that way.  Plenty of folk out there swimming in money and point at the bankers like they’re evil.  \n\nYou ever wonder what made Mark Zuckerberg so darned rich if he never actually produced anything?  Isn’t that guy trying to invent his own money?  Sounds like a classic banker to me.  But we know him as a tech mogul.\n\nHope this helped.",

You borrow $100 but when you pay it back, you pay $105. At the same time, people need a place to safely store their money. Because if we all kept our life savings at home—you get the picture. So some people deposit their money and they earn a small amount of interest paid by the bank. They deposit $100, they might earn $2 on that $100. The borrowers meanwhile pay a larger interest to the bank. The borrowers pay $5, the savers are paid $2. The bank keeps $3. The bank makes the difference., that’s their profit. The money isn’t 1 to 1 the exact same money. They can’t get a $100 deposit and then loan $100—they have to keep a reserve—but they use the deposited money to loan out money. Banks also loan to one another, to cover the required reserve, which has to be met every day. The bank has to keep enough in reserve on hand to cover the possibility that people may rush to the bank to withdraw their money. Now ramp this up in scale. Hundreds of people, thousands of loans thousands of deposits. Then you have riskier businesses borrowing money—the bank can charge a higher interest rate because of the risk. So they make more. They also encourage larger deposits by paying slightly more interest. Then they can loan out more. From here you begin to see banks doing work with businesses. Once you have a legitimate market where businesses are selling “shares” (stock) in their company—literally a stock is a small piece of ownership in the company—have banks assisting companies to sell shares of their stock—these are investment banks.

Which means money produce money. \n\nSo they take money from people who have a lot of money, if they have a lot of money their demand for money is low, and they lend it out to people who have few money, if they have few money their demand for money is high. \n\nWhich means the bank can get a high interest on the money they lend out cause supply demand for money govern interest rates. Now the bank also has to pay interest to the wealthy who lend out money to the bank but is very little. \n\nThe difference in interest rates subtracting inflation are what the bank makes money on. \n\nInterest_in - Interest_out - inflation = profit\n\nSo if inflation is 2 %, interest_out is 3%, the bank needs an interest_in higher than 5% before they start making money. \n\nOn top of that once you deposit money into the bank the bank doesnt have to guarantee to pay back all the money just maybe 10%. if there are 10 million currency units in a bank it can establish loans equivalent to 1000 million currency units on the condition the borrower has enough credit score that they can count on getting their money back with interest. \n\nThey can also invest money into stocks with gearing so if a stock with a gearing of 10 climb 1 unit, you get 10 units out of it. If you pay 100 currency units for a stock costing 100 currency units and and it has gearing of 10 and it climbs 1 up, then you the value of your investment is suddenly 110. \n\nOn top of that there are the peoples bank which the anarchist Proudhon created as a part of transitioning from capitalism to socialism. This bank doesnt bank on maximising profit but rather to make just enough money to make the wheels spinning, meaning covering the cost of the bank so that the workers gets money instead. Then when workers gets enough money it was postulated they could liberate themselves from the depression of capitalist onslaught.\n\nThe modern version of the peoples bank is a credit union, which is there to serve its members. You become a member by taking a loan. Meaning the credit union pay profit-money to its members so you get money out of that instead of the shareholders as it is in a normal bank.",

These individuals make “advisory” or “management” fees for the arrangement or management of large (hundreds of millions or billions of $/€) sums. Imagine a hedge fund manager who manages a $1 billion fund and takes a 2% management fee. That’s $20 million of revenue per year for a portfolio that can be managed by a portfolio manager, a small team and some accounting and legal assistance. That’s a large amount of money to be split among a small group and many funds are managing several billion at a time.
