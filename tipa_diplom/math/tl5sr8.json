I was so surprised when I recognized the title of your paper here!\n\nI have read an earlier version of your paper about half a year ago. I was very impressed by how you managed to simplify the construction, and by the connections to graph theory that you found. I really like your new results! And I had no idea this was your first paper too. Very well done!\n\nI am still interested in the UFA complementation question, even though my current work is on something else. I think that the graph theory approach has a potential to go somewhere. Have you done anything else with it since the paper? If you have any new ideas that you would like to share, I would very much like to hear about them. You can DM me for my e-mail.\n\nAgain, grats for getting published!",
