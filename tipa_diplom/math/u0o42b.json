He needed to call back to confirm something, and joked with her about needing to hang up if a man answered (since it was a gift).\n\nBack in the day he used to include a very funny warranty card, with comically ridiculous stipulations for the owner. Among them was that the new owner must know by heart a number of bunch of different sets of increasing lengths ending with the 7 deadly sins.  My mother complained that sloth was barely a sin, so on our warranty card it required you to be able to name the seven samurai.\n\nHis book *Cuckoo's Egg* is great read too.
