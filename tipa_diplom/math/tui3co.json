Someone below suggested meaningful binary sequences encoded as dots, which is a good idea. Another idea: Maybe we could have Fibonacci numbers encoded in unary, e.g. red dot, space, red dot, space, 2 red dots, space, 3 red dots, and so on? It would be fairly easily recognizable and we'd be able to fit at least the first few in the space we have left.",
