Attached is an animation of a mapping between a Helicoid and a Catenoid, in which the metric is preserved. Thus this transformation is called an \"isometry\". We know this mapping is possible with certain generators of the parametrization of both surfaces. Choosing choice functions for generators causes the surfaces to have the same [First Fundamental Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_fundamental_form), which allows for an inner product to be defined on the tangent space to the surface.\n\nThe First Fundamental Form is important because it allows us to define curvature, distance, etc., on the surface which allows us to do calculus-y things as if it was euclidean space.",
