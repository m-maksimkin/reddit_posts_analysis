    "r/place END RESULTS\nSuccess! We maintained our art until the whiteout. In the end, our area had a ton of different symbols representing all parts of math. Pictures of what it looked like in the end in a whole bunch of different scales can be seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/laEcv4a).\n\nThere are a whole bunch of different symbols, so I'll go over the meaning of everything.\n\n* We had an order-4 [Hilbert curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve) as the main feature of our design.\n* We had [Euler's identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_identity) in green.\n* We had text that said r/math.\n* We had 4 gliders from [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), which were colored to match [3Blue1Brown's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) logo.\n* We had an [icosahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icosahedron), the largest convex [platonic solid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid).\n* We had the greek letter phi, typically used to represent the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio) and the [Euler totient function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function).\n* We had the digits of the number pi.\n* We had bernard, the [Desmos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desmos_(graphing)) mascot.\n* We had hearts indicating our alliances with r/esplace and r/mylittlepony. These were somewhat jokingly considered references to [G. H. Hardy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._H._Hardy) and [John Littlewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Edensor_Littlewood), both notable British mathematicians who were also pacifists.\n\nWe had alliances with many groups, that indisputably kept us alive. They all helped in many ways:\n\n* r/esplace, who defended us despite a rogue Spanish streamer trying to extend their flag through our art.\n* r/MyLittlePony, who crucially helped us defend ourselves from the aforementioned Spanish streamer.\n* r/3Blue1Brown\n* r/desmos\n* r/physics\n* r/kenshi\n* r/AceCombat\n\nI'd also like to thank a few people who were especially helpful in building our design:\n\n* u/dxdydz_dV (dxdydz on discord), for significant help organizing and building.\n* u/Obyeag (Obyeag on discord), for significant help organizing and building.\n* u/kaaszmeneer (Varphi on discord), for significant help organizing and building.\n* LilMissRarity on discord, for getting our design on r/MyLittlePony's plans.\n* u/ei283 for making the original Hilbert curve post.\n* u/Maldoor for the original idea of making a Hilbert curve.\n* u/Unique_Maybe_4545, who suggested making a discord server.\n* and like 5 more people I probably missed. I'm sorry if I missed you! It's been a very hectic 4 days": [
