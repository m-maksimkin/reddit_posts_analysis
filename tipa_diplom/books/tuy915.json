I'm not sure he even had a book yet at that point, but what I remember was the author posted a side by side photograph set, a before and after photo from his own hike.  The first photo reminded me of me- a little overweight, perhaps a glossy look in the eye.  The second, more impressive photo was this lean, sort of angry looking Green Giant fellow, but he also had a look of satisfaction.  He had a sparkle to his look that wasn't present in the first photo.  I think he had a blog at that point, with some of the stories that later made the book.
