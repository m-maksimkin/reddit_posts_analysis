Like a goddess, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of our sins.\n\nTulsi Gabbard is beyond divine. I can’t help but drop to my knees in worship whenever I see her beautiful figure. I yearn for her in a way both primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in United States history just to lick the sweet, glistening sweat from her smooth, creamy skin. I want to listen to her moans as my manhood throbs within her, I want to hear her heart race as our bodies become one and our souls irreversibly intertwine in the holy sin of carnal union.\n\nI want to suckle at her motherly bosom, slurping that rich coconut milk from her teat as she gently strokes my raging erection. I would stir her velvety Samoan cream into my coffee and let my balls boil in it. Her cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to her until my body gave out, and then some. I would let her break my rib cage with any part of her body. I would let her hit me with her car just to be near her for a brief moment.\n\n\nShe’s so perfect it hurts. Every moment without her I suffer a pain worse than breaking every bone in my body simultaneously while drowning and also having shards of glass coated in hot sauce forced through every orifice of my body. I want her, I need her. I want to desecrate her pure, white pantsuit. I want to start a family with her and retire after our twenty seven children have grown up and moved out. I want to see those luscious lips speak such filthy, perverse words into my ear while she slides ice cubes down my gaping pisshole.\n\nI want to fuck her like she owes me money. I would let her step on me, just to feel the soft, firm warmth of her feet upon my face and groin area. I would sleep under her just to catch her drool in my mouth. I would fish the strands of hair from her shower drain just to smell her alluring scent, and braid them into necklaces to keep her with me always. Or cock rings. Whichever would please her more.\n\nGod please, I would do anything for her. I would relinquish my life, all my hopes and dreams, just to become the socks on her feet so that I may warm her mouthwatering toes with my very being, so that she may feel the heat of my love always. I would encase myself in cement and become her doorstep, so that she may wipe her heels upon my face. I would tear my own limbs off. I don’t know what I’d do after that, or why she might want my limbs. But I would do it.\n\n\nMy queen, my goddess, the light of my life. Please God, let me have her. I want her to be mine and only mine. I would lick the Doritos dust from her fingers and fill her belly button with honey mustard to dip my tendies in. I would give her a sponge-bath with my tongue every morning and serve her breakfast in bed. I would let her eat her eggs and pancakes off my body if it pleased her, no matter how painful the third-degree burns would be.\n\nI would bear the torment of eternal damnation until the end of time to taste the seat of her car but once. There is nothing I wouldn’t do for her, nothing I wouldn’t say. I would beat my own mother to death with my engorged penis if it would bring a smile to Tulsi’s shining face. I wouldn’t even let myself cum until she gave me permission.\n\nI love you, Tulsi Gabbard. Please. Be mine. Be my wife, my lover, my everything. Say yes. I see it in your eyes, when you’re up there on that debate stage talking about Syria or whatever. Answer my calls, respond to my letters. Something. Give me a sign, Tulsi.

The result was what one Culture Mind had described as a kind of self-perpetuating, never-ending holocaust of pain and fear. Affronter society rested on a huge base of ruthlessly exploited juvenile geldings and a sub-class of oppressed females who unless born to the highest families - and not always even then - could count themselves lucky if they were only raped by the males from their own tribe. It was generally regarded as significant - within the Culture if nowhere else - that one of the few aspects of their own genetic inheritance with which the Affront had deemed it desirable to meddle had been in the matter of making the act of sex a somewhat less pleasurable and considerably more painful act for their females than their basic genetic legacy required; the better, it was claimed, to further the considered good of the species rather than the impetuously selfish pleasure of the individual.\"- Excession\n\n\"For a year or so Father had been murdering Margaret two or three times a week. He did this in various ways. The first time he snuck up behind her with an ax at dinner, startling everyone, not least Margaret herself. After that it was gunshots, poison, hanging, whatever. Sometimes it was a surprise, sometimes not. Another time Father pierced her heart with a stiletto, but only after telling her what he would do, setting the knife before her on a silver tray, and letting her contemplate it for three full days and nights. Carolyn would have supposed that the ax would be the worse of the two, but Margaret seemed to take that one in stride. After a day or so of looking at the knife, though, she started to do that giggle of hers. And after that, she never really stopped. Carolyn sighed. Poor Margaret.\"- Library at Mount Char",

You can also throw in pig carcasses, rabbits, or the homeless people who froze to death behind the supermarket.

Ms. Henderson, Jennifer, his very own Mrs. Lovett, couldn’t possibly have known about his secret hangman fantasies, could she? The company personality tests and the cameras and skin conductivity monitors didn’t make her a mind reader, and he’d been very careful not to get caught when he worked for the undertakers. It was extra-uncomfortable to be sitting opposite Ms. Henderson with these thoughts. With her straight blonde hair, razor-blade cheekbones, and perfect skin, she’d make a beautiful corpse. “I love yer talking dirty to me,” he grunted, fantasizing about how she’d look standing hooded and shackled on his trapdoor.\n\nThere's a lot of other gross stuff in there, like the general concept of turning people into food, sending people into the abattoir while they're still alive, the concept of de-emphasizing people until they die from government neglect, or using the meat printer to make a \"human\" body, but \"hangman fantasies\" was the one that squicked me out.",

The Nazis called this program “euthanasia.” Since, for them, this term camouflaged mass murder, I have throughout this book enclosed it within quotation marks when referring to that program. The Nazis based their justification for direct medical killing on the simple concept of “ife unworthy of life” (lebensunwertes Leben). While the Nazis did not originate this concept, they carried it to its ultimate biological, racial, and “therapeutic” extreme. \n\nOf the five identifiable steps by which the Nazis carried out the principle of “life unworthy of life,” coercive sterilization was the first. \n\n***There followed the killing of “impaired” children in hospitals; and then the killing of “impaired” adults, mostly collected from mental hospitals, in centers especially equipped with carbon monoxide gas. ***\n\nThis project was extended (in the same killing centers) to “impaired” inmates of concentration and extermination camps and, finally, to mass killings, mostly of Jews, in the extermination camps themselves.””",

Just a trigger warning, if you plan to read the book, it might be highly offensive to some. There is no filter, i am talking litterally r*pe jokes and stuff. Here are some of the better quotes.\n\n\"“Look, God is  creating water right now.” I point to Samantha, who is now pissing in the middle of the street.\"\n\n\"The following morning I am awakened by the deputy, telling me that I have a visitor. As my eyes adjust to the sun, I see the Mexican shitting.  Again. “Hey, Chubs, you shit in that hole one more time today, and I’m going to bury you in it.  Comprende ?” I say to him sternly. “What am I supposed to do if I have to go to the bathroom?” I reach into my jeans pocket, pull out a small sewing kit, and toss it to him. “You better start sewing your asshole shut. Cheek to cheek. A classic backstitch should work.” \"\n\n\"Have you ever gotten so angry that you start uncontrollably shaking and piss your pants? Typically it only happens to blind people when you fuck with their dogs, but it happens to  me at this moment.\"\n\n\"When I see it, I laugh like a schoolgirl with tuberculosis. Whoever said “Money can’t buy you happiness” was  obviously really fucking poor.\"\n\nA footnote in chapter 15: It takes about hour before i am rich again:\n\"“Fairy tale” means anal.\"\n\n\"“Have you been thirsty? I hadn’t noticed. Sorry about that. Here you go.” I pull yet another canteen out of my jacket and hand it to him.\nHe smiles, genuinely touched. “Thank you.”\n“No problem. Good luck with everything.”\nWhen I pat him on the shoulder and walk out, I don’t even have to turn back around to know that he appreciated the old “empty canteen trick.”\"\n\n\"That’s when I make the decision to reach over and pick up his bloody chopped-off left hand . . . and jam it up his own ass.\"\n\nAfter the main character gets extremely drunk:\n\"A man’s hand slaps me on the shoulder from behind. “That drink is the shit, ain’t it?” I quick-draw and fire a shot into his stomach, then re-holster  without even turning around. The entire bar grinds to a halt and stares at me. Even the half-nude midget pianist stops playing and runs out of the bar. I glance down at the man I just shot, recognizing his face. It’s one of the Schläger brothers from the bukkake line. He looks up at me in disbelief as he coughs up blood. “Why did you do that?” he asks. “No one asks me to  drink  and  shit , you  hear me?”\"\n\n\"One of the marshals grabs me and leads me through the front door. On the way in, I shake my leg twice, and an  apple  rolls down my pant leg, resting on my boot.  I kick it up in the air to my horse, who catches it midair in his mouth. “You keep an apple tucked inside your jeans?” a marshal asks. “I didn’t know it was there until I stood up. My cock is like an elephant trunk; sometimes it just reaches up and grabs fruit unbeknownst to me.”\"",

The child’s whole body was covered in bruises. Eventually they devised a new refinement. Under the pretext that the child dirtied her bed (as though a five-year-old deep in her angelic sleep could be punished for that), they forced her to eat excrement, smearing it all over her face. And it was the mother that did it! And that woman would lock her daughter up in the outhouse until morning and she did so even on the coldest nights, when it was freezing. Just imagine the woman being able to sleep with the child’s cries coming from that outhouse! Imagine that little creature, unable to even understand what is happening to her, beating her sore little chest with her tiny fist, weeping hot, unresentful, meek tears, and begging ‘gentle Jesus’ to help her…\n\n...let’s assume that you were called upon to build the edifice of human destiny so that men would finally be happy and would find peace and tranquility. If you knew that, only to attain this, you would have to torture just one single creature, let’s say the little girl who beat her chest so desperately in the outhouse, and that on her unavenged tears you could build that edifice, would you agree to do it?”\n\n― Fyodor Dostoevsky\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAND\n\n“Look at your body— A painted puppet, a poor toy Of jointed parts ready   \nto collapse, A diseased and suffering thing With a head full of false   \nimaginings. —The Dhammapada” \n- Thomas Ligotti\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAND\n\n“I would like to be free, totaly free... free like an aborted child.”\n― Emil Cioran\n\n\n“The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.”\n― David Foster Wallace \n\nAND\n\n“Everybody is identical in their secret unspoken belief that way deep down they are different from everyone else.”\n― David Foster Wallace\n\n\n“A phenomenon that a number of people have noted while in deep depression is the sense of being accompanied by a second self — a wraithlike observer who, not sharing the dementia of his double, is able to watch with dispassionate curiosity as his companion struggles against the oncoming disaster, or decides to embrace it. There is a theatrical quality about all this, and during the next several days, as I went about stolidly preparing for extinction, I couldn't shake off a sense of melodrama — a melodrama in which I, the victim-to-be of self-murder, was both the solitary actor and lone member of the audience.”\n― William Styron\n\n\n“The pain of severe depression is quite unimaginable to those who have not suffered it, and it kills in many instances because its anguish can no longer be borne. The prevention of many suicides will continue to be hindered until there is a general awareness of the nature of this pain.”\n― William Styron\n\n“In depression this faith in deliverance, in ultimate restoration, is absent. The pain is unrelenting, and what makes the condition intolerable is the foreknowledge that no remedy will come- not in a day, an hour, a month, or a minute. If there is mild relief, one knows that it is only temporary; more pain will follow. It is hopelessness even more than pain that crushes the soul. So the decision-making of daily life involves not, as in normal affairs, shifting from one annoying situation to another less annoying- or from discomfort to relative comfort, or from boredom to activity- but moving from pain to pain. One does not abandon, even briefly, one’s bed of nails, but is attached to it wherever one goes. And this results in a striking experience- one which I have called, borrowing military terminology, the situation of the walking wounded. For in virtually any other serious sickness, a patient who felt similar devistation would by lying flat in bed, possibly sedated and hooked up to the tubes and wires of life-support systems, but at the very least in a posture of repose and in an isolated setting. His invalidism would be necessary, unquestioned and honorably attained. However, the sufferer from depression has no such option and therefore finds himself, like a walking casualty of war, thrust into the most intolerable social and family situations. There he must, despite the anguish devouring his brain, present a face approximating the one that is associated with ordinary events and companionship. He must try to utter small talk, and be responsive to questions, and knowingly nod and frown and, God help him, even smile. But it is a fierce trial attempting to speak a few simple words.”\n― William Styron\n\n\n“Depression is a disorder of mood, so mysteriously painful and elusive in the way it becomes known to the self -- to the mediating intellect-- as to verge close to being beyond description. It thus remains nearly incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it in its extreme mode.”\n― William Styron\n\n“It is hopelessness even more than pain that crushes the soul.”\n― William Styron\n\nSorry it's a bit much, i'm not as depressed as i used to be but these things helped me during those rough times.\n\n-24M",

But actually, we feel this destruction only in the evils of illness or of old age; on the other hand, for the subject, death itself consists merely in the moment when consciousness vanishes, since the activity of the brain ceases. The extension of the stoppage to all the other parts of the organism which follows this is really already an event after death. Therefore, in a subjective respect, death concerns only consciousness. Now from going to sleep everyone can, to some extent, judge what the vanishing of consciousness may be; and whoever has had a real fainting fit knows it even better. The transition here is not so gradual, nor is it brought about by dreams; but first of all, while we are still fully conscious, the power of sight disappears, and then immediately supervenes the deepest unconsciousness. As far as the accompanying sensation goes, it is anything but unpleasant; and undoubtedly just as sleep is the brother of death, so is the fainting fit its twin-brother. Violent death also cannot be painful, for, as a rule, even severe wounds are not felt at all till some time afterwards, and are often noticed only from their external symptoms. If they are rapidly fatal, consciousness will vanish before this discovery; if they result in death later, it is the same as with other illnesses. All who have lost consciousness in water, through charcoal fumes, or through hanging, also state, as is well known, that it happened without pain. And finally, even death through natural causes proper, death through old age, euthanasia, is a gradual vanishing and passing out of existence in an imperceptible manner. In old age, passions and desires, together with the susceptibility to their objects, are gradually extinguished; the emotions no longer find any excitement, for the power to make representations or mental pictures becomes weaker and weaker, and its images feebler. The impressions no longer stick to us, but pass away without a trace; the days roll by faster and faster; events lose their significance; everything glows pale. The old man, stricken in years, totters about or rests in a corner, now only a shadow, a ghost, of his former self. What still remains there for death to destroy? One day a slumber is his last, and his dreams are… They are the dreams that Hamlet asks about in the famous monologue. I believe that we dream them just now.”**",

He considered himself to be the only real person, and everyone exists around him He thinks back to how when his brother was born, he got annoyed that his parents paid less attention to him. It also freaked him out that his brother might be \"real \" too He suffocated the baby without caring, and then casually sat down to watch TV.

It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really.

Both for practical reasons and for mathematically verifiable moral reasons, authority and responsibility must be equal — else a balancing takes place as surely as current ‘flows between points of unequal potential. To permit irresponsible authority is to sow disaster; to hold a man responsible for anything he does not control is to behave with blind idiocy. The unlimited democracies were unstable because their citizens were not responsible for the fashion in which they exerted their sovereign authority... other than through the tragic logic of history. The unique ‘poll tax’ that we must pay was unheard of. No attempt was made to determine whether a voter was socially responsible to the extent of his literally unlimited authority. If he voted the impossible, the disastrous possible happened instead — and responsibility was then forced on him willy-nilly and destroyed both him and his foundationless  \n>  \n>temple.\"  \n>  \n>\"Superficially, our system is only slightly different; we have democracy unlimited by race, color, creed, birth, wealth, sex, or conviction, and anyone may win sovereign power by a usually short and not too arduous term of service — nothing more than a light workout to our cave-man ancestors. But that slight difference is one between a system that works, since it is constructed to match the facts, and one that is inherently unstable. Since sovereign franchise is the ultimate in human authority, we insure that all who wield it accept the ultimate in social responsibility — we require each person who wishes to exert control over the state to wager his own life — and lose it, if need be — to save the life of the state. The maximum responsibility a human can accept is thus equated to the ultimate authority a human can exert.
