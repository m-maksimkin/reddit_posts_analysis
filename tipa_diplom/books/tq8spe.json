    "Ender's Game seems like the poster child for 'support the art not the artist'. I don't understand how an outspoken homophobe wrote this amazing book that champions the power of empathy, but thank goodness for libraries and used book stores so we can still read and enjoy this wonderful book.\nOrson Scott Card is an outspoken homophobe who donates to anti-gay causes, so its a pretty natural response to not want to support him financially. Here are a couple quotes from him on the issue:\n\n>\"Regardless of law, marriage has only one definition, and any government that attempts to change it is my mortal enemy. I will act to destroy that government and bring it down.\"  \n>  \n>\"The dark secret of homosexual society — the one that dares not speak its name — is how many homosexuals first entered into that world through a disturbing seduction or rape or molestation or abuse, and how many of them yearn to get out of the homosexual community and live normally.\"\n\nSo, gross is a bit of an understatement. That said, Ender's Game has an incredibly important message that it would truly be a shame to lose. Thank goodness we're fans of a medium which has options for consuming the art without financially supporting the artist.\n\nIf you haven't read the book, here's the setup (no spoilers IMO, back of the book kind of thing, but I'll still put it in black in case you prefer to go in with a blank slate). >!It's the story of Ender Wiggin, a boy who is recruited into the elite orbital Battle School. There, young men and women are trained into the next generation of military leaders to command the forces of humanity against the buggers. The buggers are insect-like aliens who have attempted to invade the solar system twice, nearly wiping out humanity in the most recent invasion, and now humanity is preparing for the next battle.!<\n\n>!Ender is a brilliant, empathetic kid, but has felt mostly alone his entire life. His older brother Peter is a violent sociopath, and only Ender’s older sister Valentine prevented Peter from attacking Ender. Now, at battle school, Ender feels even more alone, surrounded by children older than himself and adults who are constantly pushing him to his limits and trying to force him to be violent in an attempt to either break him or mold him into the best military commander Earth has ever produced.!<\n\nThis book is so many wonderful things at once.\n\nFirst, the core theme of the book is the power of empathy and how, even if you're only goal is to 'succeed' in life, you still should strive to put yourself in other people's shoes. Sure, you need intelligence and drive, but if you truly understand other people and how they think and feel, you'll both be the kind of person other people want to be around and able to understand other people's motivations and values. I don't know about in the rest of the world, but in America we have far too little popular art that highlights the power and importance of empathy - and by showing how empathy is invaluable even to people who only want to 'succeed', I think Card has made a truly unique argument for a habitually undervalued virtue that speaks perfectly to the people who most need to hear it.\n\nThe book is also just an unbelievable page turner. It's the classic hero's journey - and Ender is a hero that you absolutely will want to root for. How can you not be on the side of the brilliant, sensitive six year old kid who is taken from his family and put through hell to try and save the whole human race? It's also got one of the best twists of all time, which in addition to blowing your mind on the first read, also brings home subthemes about the importance of communication to avoid conflict, and a general anti-war message as well.\n\nFor lots of other kinds of art, its very hard to consume that art without financially supporting the artist. Thank goodness that we have libraries and used book stores, which make it possible to read wonderful books by problematic authors without sending money to that problematic author.\n\nPS part of a series recommending (and digging into the good, the bad, and the ugly in) the best sci fi books of all time. Search Hugonauts on your podcast app of choice if you're interested in a deeper discussion about the novel, related book recs, and a way to help find the good sci fi without having to wade through all the bad ones (no ads, just trying to spread the love of good books). Happy reading everybody!": [

Interestingly, several of his works are also veiled retellings of Mormon history or theology (and far better written lol):\n\n*The Tales of Alvin Maker* series is basically Joseph Smith reimagined.\n\nThe *Homecoming* series is basically the Book of Mormon if it were a sci-fi.\n\n*The Worthing Saga* is basically the Mormon concepts of Adam and exalted humanity becoming godlike over other worlds.\n\n*The Folk of the Fringe* is basically a retelling of the Mormon exodus to and settling of Utah. \n\n*Ender’s Game* is one of several that don’t really have a Mormon foundation, although allusions exist with *Hiram* Graff, etc. \n\nThere is good and bad in any artist’s work, and it is up to the reader to decide what is okay for them personally that maintains their individual beliefs in a responsible manner. We can suggest and educate all we want, but we must also allow people the right to choose. I mentioned these factors to a Mormon coworker once, and he was astonished at the parallels, but the existence also of some sexuality and topics in the books were also aspects that prevented him from even reading them. So as you can see, it is a complex issue and worth letting the individual decide for themselves when presented with the evidences one may find concerning in the stories or with their author’s own personal views.",

There were unquestioned, systemic biases on both sides of the political spectrum, as there are today, but back then many of the biases were shared across parties and ideologies. It really was a straight white man’s world back then and no one was either given the voice to really challenge it, and most minority groups hadn’t gained a strong enough footing at the time to really be able to make waves without negatively effecting their communities and undoing the hard work they had done for generations: so people didnt challenge the status quo for a while. The society was not like it is today, nor was communication. Card and others like him are just vestigial remnants of a bygone era who still enjoy the success they rightfully earned many years ago. And frankly they were the best of those in positions of power at the time- by a long shot.\n\nShould the guy change his views today? Sure, if he wants to be continually relevant and successful in today’s climate. But will he? Not likely. And most likely neither will you on some issues when you’re his age. Every generation learns from the last and those from the prior generation who want to continue their success into the next must be willing to adapt as well as retain their former brilliancy. Mark Twain would be considered all kinds of racist and prejudiced if he were alive today and held the same views he did 150 years ago-but back then he was so far beyond what people back then would consider to be progressive and woke, and had he lived today he’d probably be right there with Bernie Sanders- or not- hard to say what would have influenced his ideological development had he been born at a later time.

OSC, as I knew him as a base person, is a really warm and welcoming guy who genuinely wants good things for people and does not judge based on race. The person that comes through his earlier writing is a reflection of the man who wrote those books.  \n>  \n>He's got a lot of scars though and he's got a real thing about needing to be the smartest person in the room all the time. Plus, he was a Mormon who was at times taken to task for his books not being, this is simplifying for lack of a better word, conservative enough. And, like I said, he seems to pretty obviously be a gay man who decided that the only way to live that way is the thing he has multiple characters in later books pronounce, often out of nowhere, to marry a woman and father children. This was shot all to hell by the incredibly rapid acceptance of open gay relationships and marriage during his late middle age. This happened at the same time as the W Bush Iraq years and OSC backed the obviously wrong side there, but like I said, can't stand not being the smartest person in the room plus he really is a master storyteller, so he pulled a cofeve and really dug in instead of admitting he was wrong.  \n>  \n>He turned into someone whose brain was filled with angry bees, at least in relation to political issues where he was also dug into a bunch of objectively wrong positions because he was not willing to admit to being wrong and was telling convincing stories to himself that he was right. So, he HATED Barack Obama. Just pure, unthinking vitriol. The problematic statements in that essay, to me, are a part of this hatred and not indications of underlying racism. In that fantasy that he was spinning (for the consumption of the Fox News crowd), he needed a shadowy army to back Obama the Dictator up and grabbed at something that would fill that role. (Amusingly, he wrote a horrible book around this time with a somewhat similar premise where the dreaded \"intellectuals\" used like a robot army to overthrow the government and oppress true thinking conservatives.)  \n>  \n>I don't really know, my personal contact with him was limited and over before he went down that path, but even where he was, I really don't think it was more than that. Ultimately, he lost, thank goodness and I'm hoping that he's let the fight go and has found a measure of peace. I'm pretty sure he resigned from the anti-gay hate group he was on the board of. It seems like he burnt out his literary talents and nothing I've seen from him since has been worth reading. The long anticipated Ender's Game movie was pretty bad and hurt even more because of the boycott. But he really was that guy that came through from his earlier books and it was a tragedy to see what he let himself become.\n\nI'm wary of the idea that homophobic people are repressed gays themselves, but OSC fits this to a T.\n\nOne of his earlier books, Songbird, has a gay character who feels tempted towards having sex with men, but when he does, he experiences intense pain that almost kills him and leaves him impotent and the man he loves is executed. Multiple gay (his gay characters are always male, never female) characters in his books openly espouse what OSC wrote in non fiction essays, that the right way to be gay is to marry women and have biological children. He's a great writer, but he's pretty much incapable of writing realistic male-female romantic action or dialog. And, this actually happened, he wrote an essay about how, if you don't force young men to partner with women, they're going to naturally want to be with other men, because women are so incomprehensible and different from men.",

Peter is bad because he does bad things and he enjoys it, and he also does *good* things later in his life, but he is still considered *bad*.  \n\nThe truth is that almost everyone feels bad when they bad things and it’s the decision of whether to do those bad things or not that makes a person good or bad.  Hannah Arendt wrote about ‘the banality of evil’ - and included quotes from German Nazis about how terrible the suffering was of *concentration camp guards as they shoved innocent mothers and their pleading children into the gas rooms*. It was so hard for them to witness their pleading!  In real life, good people do good things, and bad people do bad things, because we only have access to one persons’ interiority, and that is our own.\n\nEnder’s Game is enjoyable for children and young adults because Ender lives in a world where every bad choice he makes is forced on him, he has no other alternative, and he has no moral responsibility for it.  This relief from responsibility is a balm for someone who isn’t yet ready to take on the mantle of responsibility for their own poor choices and bad actions, whether that’s kicking a cat or saying a mean  thing to a classmate or cheating on your high school girlfriend.  Ender’s adults fail/refuse to protect him and bear the ultimate responsibility for his actions in the same way that every young person would prefer to externalization blame for their actions.  \n\nI can only imagine that Enders Game came about from Card sitting down and challenging himself to write a book where the protagonist committed the most terrible crimes possible - murder of children and genocide - and yet was completely sympathetic and justified.  Stephen King wrote about posing himself a similar challenge, he wanted to write a book where the sympathetic protagonist was a man who assassinated the President of the United States.  And that’s fine, that’s an interesting challenge.  But what comes out the other end is Ender the perpetual innocent, the blameless genocide, and once you grow out of the ‘this situation is so terrible how horrible for this character’ and you are walking through ‘this situation is so terrible, why did the author want to write a book where a character did this’, it becomes disquieting.\n\nI have no doubt that I will get downvoted to hell for this and I regret posting it already but I can’t get ‘good people do good things’ out of my head today, so there it is.",

            "text": "The problem is that you are judging all of Card's works through the lens of what he became. *Ender's Game* was written when Card was a teenager. In his youth, Card was actually a strong supporter of LGBT rights and had several friends and contacts in the LGBT community. \n\nAnd then, in the mid 90s, he researched and wrote *Lost Boys*. \n\n(If you've never heard of it, it's an urban fantasy/horror. A family move into a new home and the eight year old son starts talking about the boys he is playing with who can't talk and his parents can't seem to see, and keep trying to keep him away from the friendly old man next door neighbour. And then the eight year old goes missing. Of course it comes out that the old man is a paedophile who, after his family told him that if he didn't stop molesting them they would go to the police, started luring in boys in the neighbourhood, raping them and murdering them when he was finished. The invisible voiceless boys were the ghosts of his previous victims and the eight year old had become his latest victim.)\n\nThe turnaround between before-LB Card and after-LB Card is extraordinary. It's like he just took in and swallowed all the \"gays=paedophiles\" propaganda he would have found while researching during that time period. He turned his back on people he had previously called friends (the contemporary accounts from his former friends were really sad to read) and became very conservative in his views. It's really very sad.\n\nBut yeah, pre-1990s Card and post-1990s Card are two very different people.\n\n(Edit for accidentally hitting the submit button early.)",

Zdorab is a completely regular guy who accidentally gets recruited into a family of god-chosen heroes and villains, and was my favorite character in the series. He chooses to have children with one of the other women -- they're two of only sixteen survivors of the human race, and the ONLY couple in which neither is related to anyone else, so this is very helpful to the genetic health of the human race long-term -- something I thought of as an extremely heroic action that he is content to take no credit for. I was very pro-gay as a tween, something that was not a given in suburban Texas in the late 90s/early 00s, and I do think it had a lot to do with my perception of Zdorab as a normal guy who happened to be gay who wasn't destined to be a hero but chose to be one anyway. Now, I realize that Zdorab's story is all tied up in Orson Scott Card's Morman beliefs on homosexuality -- which generally holds that it's okay to experience gay thoughts but that you must never act on them, enter into a heterosexual Mormon marriage, and have Mormon children.....through that lens, Zdorab's act is less heroic and more the bare minimum of what he needs to do to go to heaven. I'm not sure how to square the fact that the foundation of my support for the LGBTQ+ community is built on someone who feels so differently about it than I do, but it's part of who I am.\n\nAs a side note, I think it's interesting to look that OSC's/LDS Church views on homosexuality and marriage with the way love is generally portrayed in his books. People very rarely end up together because they love each other -- marriage in his books is often cold and logical: what kind of genes will we pass to our children (a VERY common question in his works across several different series)? Will this person be able to provide for me? Would marrying this person give them access to information or resources I don't want them to have access to? It's...a lot, and to me speaks to a person who has fundamentally different views on the important of love than me.",

But I also don't see any of this judgement and bigotry in either Ender's Game of Speaker for the Dead.\n\nI don't see it in his other Ender/Shadow books (and I've read them through Last Shadow, which reintegrates the two story threads). But - after Speaker for the Dead, and after Ender's Shadow, these two series do fall off the rails. I enjoyed the Last Shadow, but it certainly wasn't a must read.\n\n1. I don't think anyone should be forced to read a book that they truly do not want to based on the author's words or actions\n2. I don't think anyone should be prevented from reading a book that they wish to read based on someone else's opinion about the author's words or actions\n3. I don't think anyone should be judged based on whether or not they are comfortable reading a book based on the words or actions of the author\n\nAlso, I think it's worth mentioning that a reader's view on this topic are probably a function of how they see books.\n\nTo me - the author is simply not a part of the book once it's out their hands. My experience of reading is one between myself and the book itself. I wouldn't judge a book by it's author. I'd also never judge a human being by their parents.\n\nBut - this is not the only view. It's perfectly reasonable to feel a connection to the artist as well as the art. And, if someone feels this connection, it's entirely understandable for someone to be uncomfortable reading a book because of the actions or words of the author. It's also perfectly reasonable to refuse to read it.\n\nMy only other comment is to state my opinion that there is a vast difference between an author's words and an author's actions. Orson Scott Cards words are troubling. I also think they come from a distorted perspective. (Yes, the first sexual encounter of many gay people was unhealthy, but I'm not sure that this is substantially less for straight people. I certainly not convinced it affects the preferred sex of future partners.)\n\nBut - if we look at Marion Zimmer Bradley, whose actions were both abominable and depressing - I simply can't put Card's words in the same category of Bradly's actions. This is my opinion, and I don't expect everyone to share it, but I do feel rather strongly about it.",

Sure, you need intelligence and drive, but if you truly understand other people and how they think and feel, you'll both be the kind of person other people want to be around and able to understand other people's motivations and values. I don't know about in the rest of the world, but in America we have far too little popular art that highlights the power and importance of empathy - and by showing how empathy is invaluable even to people who only want to 'succeed', I think Card has made a truly unique argument for a habitually undervalued virtue that speaks perfectly to the people who most need to hear it.\n\nI don’t disagree that empathy is an important quality. But I’d qualify that most of us know exactly why it is invaluable (or imperative) to success. \n\nWhen used benignly, it makes us better communicators, when used selfishly, it’s used to manipulate people to get what we want by playing on what we know they feel. \n\nThink: e.g. anecdotal - most Fortune 500 / Richest Men and Women in the world are thought to be psychopaths; psychopaths are known not to experience human emotions, but use their insights to get what they want.\n\nBut aside from that opinion, I do love ED.",

Faith gave me such a strong sense of being loved. It taught empathy in that no one is in a position to judge because everyone needs forgiveness, and God wants mercy for everyone. But along with these delights, it also taught me that God knows best and God only wants us to have sex in opposite-sex marriages, and I experienced that as a package deal. \n\nThe thinking goes, \"We must love gay people and treat them with kindness, because they are God's children and He has a beautiful plan for them. It might seem sad that they can't express love like straight couples can, but God loves them and wants the best for them so I'm sure He has a good reason for His commandments! The real cruelty would be to withhold the joy of the Lord from them.\" \n\nCriticism of that principle then becomes an attack on the source of your transcendental hope, an offer to trade divine, unending love for fallible & temporary human love. \n\nAnd this might be more true of Catholicism specifically, but celibacy is regarded heroically. Much of what they say is genuinely true but frame in service of the ideology.  \"You're living like Jesus, the apostles, the church fathers, the saints, and the Pope! You have time to give to your community that you otherwise couldn't due to family or romantic obligations! Besides, marriage is hard work and involves sacrifice. You can't expect to feel lovey-dovey for your spouse every day for years and years! And almost everyone has some antisocial sexual feelings they can't express.

The only explanation being \"oh well Ender is brilliant and smart, so he just did this & this\" and the conflict's over before it even started. The only one i feel that lasted long was the Teachers vs. Ender conflict that didn't have any proper ending to it.\n\nI liked Dink's character how he's shown as this wise guy who knows and shows the harms of being a commander and generally when i reached the phase of the book where Ender becomes commander, i felt there was great potential to build on this and make a great plot: Dink becoming what he didn't want to become, a corrupt commander (in the beginning Ender feels as if Dink and Petra are not his friends but later he realizes otherwise), and Ender behaving similarly to Bean (who had an interesting character that could be developed upon.) However Card failed to turn this huge potential into a promising concept and just went ahead.\n\nOverall the characters were really blank and I saw minimalistic character development which made it quite boring for me. The idea of the 3 Wiggins being polarizing opposites and by the time Ender meets Val in the lake, they have morphed somewhat and we don't know what to expect of any character; Peter seems to be becoming more peaceful, Val enjoys the destructive ideas of her fictional character, Ender becoming more like Peter. But again there is no build up and it just makes it so much more disappointing.\n\nAlso the whole section of \"Peter and Val influencing politics by just posting their opinions\" is just really really stupid and too unrealistic even for sci fi. I might even be persuaded into believing this if there was some good reasoning behind it, but the only explanation we get is they could do so because \"wow, they are really smart\". This really isn't an answer i'm looking forward to especially for every conflict (\"Ender beating a much more bigger Bonzo with his only tactic being making his body slippy, etc.\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI am open to criticism as i would love to be countered and hear positives to  this book",

Obviously Rowling is an example, and it's amazing to me that concentrated effort, particularly by millenials and zoomers, to 'reclaim' her work without her permission.  \nMy 2 big examples are HP Lovecraft and GRRM. I adore Lovecraft's work but he was so wildly racist that it's impossible to defend. I often question whether I should choose to remember the stories fondly and get rid of the substantial collection I have of his work.  \nI used to be a big ASOIAF fan, like a lot of people, but I have found it difficult to like the work as it is aged. It doesn't have anything to do with the lack of releases, moreso that over time I have found GRRM's depiction of sex, sexual violence, slavery, and so on to be very disturbing and especially so when you consider the character's ages. Combined with his seeming outright disdain for fans, and the deal with the Hugos with mispronouncing the winner's name and vaguely transphobic statements...it has left a very bad taste in my mouth for an IP I otherwise adored.  \nI find it confusing and I'm really  not sure if I can separate art and artist.",
