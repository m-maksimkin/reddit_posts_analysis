    "I’m 100 pages into Dune…\nAnd, although I am enjoying it, I have to ask, how much of this am I supposed to be understanding so far?! Is it normal that I feel very deep in the weeds? I feel like I’m understanding maybe 50% of what’s going on. I’m intrigued by this rivalry between the Harkonnens’ and the Atreides’, but they’ve mentioned the Emperor and based on context clues I’m assuming they’re…bad? But I have no idea. What the hell does CHOAM do? What is spice used for? It’s insanely valuable, but its a drug? Do the Bene Gesserit have super powers? What are all these words?! \n\nI feel like I’m missing a lot and it making me anxious. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: you’re all remarkably encouraging. Also, this post seems to be helping out others who felt in over their heads while reading. Keep your perspectives coming! Wish I was this thought provoking on all social media lol.": [

There’s a big guy at the top that can command everyone, but it’s made of tons of duchies and counties that have inter played alliances to balance power of the empire.\n\nCHOAM is a super corporation that iirc basically controls all trade within the empire. The Emperor, lords, and dukes all have substantial stocks in CHOAM which is where most of their money comes from.\n\nSpice is weird, but basically it’s a drug that lets you live longer.\n\nBene Gesserit are literally super Jedi, this series inspired a ton of what we see in Star Wars. However unlike the Jedi, instead of getting dragged into bureaucracy they largely control and manipulate it from the shadows. The Voice is quite literally “These are not the droids you’re looking for.”\n\nFrank Herbert has an expanded lexicon so I recommend you keep a dictionary nearby as you read; furthermore, in the very back of the book is a glossary which defines a ton of the terms he invented for this universe.\n\nDUNE has heavily inspired all sci-fi in the last 60 odd years. Really you should think of it as the father of 40k, because this universe is not a pleasant place and could not care less if you died in utter agony",

A friend of mine who is one of the smartest dudes I know helped me unpack this. I wouldn't have figured it out myself. \"Dune is like Star Wars if it didn't give a fuck about you.\" Star Wars was made, top to bottom, for mass market audience appeal. Note I am not saying that to be elitist! It isn't bad! Episode IV is a masterclass in onboarding the audience into a bunch of wacky SF/F bullshit. But Dune doesn't do that, because Herbert doesn't give a fuck about you. He wants to do exactly the thing he is doing, which is tell a story about how institutions drift from their original purposes over long periods of history, how people and ecology interact, etc. etc. Read Dune in this spirit. The answers are there but the author doesn't give a fuck about you. That's why you get almost no description of what anything looks like. One of the most interesting bits of the film adaptations is just watching them to see what their visual interpretation is. The shielding in the new movie was an extremely cool visual shorthand - it explained with colors something Herbert threw at you and expected you to think about the implications of yourself.\n2. HOKAY. The Guild Navigators are a bunch of posthuman psychics who are the only people who can reliably pilot starships between systems. They need spice. Lots of spice. Otherwise they can't pilot the ships. Pardon the all-caps: ALL INTER-SYSTEM TRADE AND TRAVEL IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON THE SPICE SUPPLY. Everything goes to absolute shit if the spice supply cuts out. Yes it's a drug, it has other effects that are useful, but the most important thing you need to know about it is that the empire and every noble house within it need the spice supply to stay more or less stable. House Harkonnen are more than just \"bad\" because Herbert is more sophisticated than that, but for now, yeah, they're cackling villains. The Emperor is more obviously complicated. CHOAM is like the big megacorporation that all the noble houses try to suck money out of. The Guild is independent of it, damn near the only economic entity that IS independent of it, and the only reason they can stay that way is that they can destroy anyone who fucks with them by ceasing to travel to or from that world. Compare to the Landsraad which is the \\*political\\*, as opposed to purely economic, body run by the houses, and exists so they can self-protect from power grabs by the emperor. The Bene Gesserit have superpowers, but they aren't psychic or magic. The in-universe conceit is that they know so much about the human organism and its relations with others that they can masterfully manipulate almost anyone, and they have crazy biofeedback powers like deciding whether to have a boy or a girl. Mentats are the same way - basically superpowers, but it's something a person can learn to do with training, and it has a scientific (or at least sci-fi) underpinning. \n\nOh yeah and the spice is oil. The books are about how the whole world exploits the middle east for its oil reserves.",

An empire can only cycle as fast as it can move stuff around.  This is what made Rome great, and the Spacing Guild is what allows the Empire to exist at all.\n\n- as the Guild runs on spice, and the Empire runs on the Guild, and spice is only found on Arrakis, _the spice must flow_ or their modern world grinds to a halt...\n\n\n- Bene Gesserit are are elevated humas via spice.  they train in all kinds of disciplines, but ultimately have to ascend w/use of spice.  if they survive, they unlock the collective genetic memory of all their ancestors.

Also you'll learn more on each rereading.  It's a great book, but definitely a book designed for multiple experiences.\n\n> by this rivalry between the Harkonnens’ and the Atreides’, but they’ve mentioned the Emperor and based on context clues I’m assuming they’re…bad? \n\nIt's more imperial control of the universe.  The Emperor is largely unimportant other than \"Large force that decides who controls what.\"  Harkonnen is clearly imperialistic, where Atreides feels like they want to lightly control the populace and nurture them, but I think you may have already seen, Duke Atreides knows this is a bit of a trap.  he's being given Arrakis but he's also set up to fail/lose by the Emperor/court.  (maybe that was added more for the movie but that idea was in the early parts of the book).\n\n> But I have no idea. What the hell does CHOAM do? \n\nLargely unimportant in the grand scheme.  But they are basically like the corporation behind the scenes (or even a stock/future market)\n \n>What is spice used for? \n\nYou should have seen this now, but Spice is the piece that allows Guild Navigators to do the interstellar transportation while warping space.  Basically with Spice they can travel, with out spice, everything stops and no one would be able to do interstellar travel (or at least would have to do it at a slow speed) \n\nAgain the what is not super important in the long run... What you need to know is that Spice is an ultra value commodity that is only found on one planet.    Basically spice makes the universe work, which is why Arrakis (Dune) is a critical world.\n\n> It’s insanely valuable, but its a drug?  \n\nYup, but it's a drug that does something.  Think of it like a steroid.  It's not normally done for pleasure.  \n\n> Do the Bene Gesserit have super powers?\n\n.... I mean ... no ... yes... sure... maybe...    Depends on the version.   you'll learn this over time for sure.\n\nSo the one thing Bene Gesserits have is the ability to have \"Other memories\" Think of it like past lives, they can remember EVERY SINGLE FEMALE ANCESTOR through genetic memory.   It's only passed down through women and has never been achieved by men...  And of course that totally won't change in this book... right? \n\nThis isn't every Bene Gesserit but done by all the \"reverend mothers\" \n\nBeyond that, they are also due selective breeding.   Bene Gesserit basically are breeding towards a Kwisatz Haderach, a man who can get these other memories including male ancestores.  There's a lot more here, but yeah this is kind of magic power. \n \nBut then the other \"powers\"   The Voice, their combat prowness,  The ability to tell truth from others, mental multitasking blah blah blah..   All of these are amazing feats but all learned abilities (or learned through the Other Memory. \n\nIf you remember there's a point where they train someone to move their little toe.   (That might be the movie only, I can't remember).  Basically that's the level of control a Bene Gesserit employees.  So does Bruce Lee have \"special powers\"  No... and in that way Bene Gesserits mostly doesn't...   You can think of them as Shaolin Monks, but female, and some of them actually gain special powers (Which a lot of Shaolin Monk lore tend to also add for 'higher levels')  Basically most of them just have impeccable control of almost everything they say and do.",

            "text": "With the movie out, a lot of my friends have started reading Dune and have the same feelings as you. Dune is a challenging book to read. The world is so unfamiliar to our own. The appendix is going to be your friend for this novel (which is why I don't recommend an audio book).\n\nHere is a simple explanation of the setting: \n\nHumans have been an interstellar species for quite a while. Early(lol) settlers colonized the stars with advanced computers and starships. At some point artificial intelligence rose up against people (think terminator style war). Humans made it illegal to build complex computers again.\n\nSpice is a drug that enhances mental capacity and allows it's users to essentially see into the future. So that is why spice is necessary for space travel. When traveling at many times the speed of light, the navigators can see if they are going to hit anything, and make sure that they get to the destination safely without the use of computers.\n\nThe CHOAM is a business owned by the ruling class of the imperium. The emperor owns 51% of the company and this has a controlling interest. The company functions in society as a market maker for spice and kinda like a central bank as well.\n\nThe space guild have a monopoly on interstellar travel. You cannot physically get to another planet without hiring the guild to take you there.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit are the religious arm of the imperium. Think like the Catholic church in the 1600-1700's. They are a part of the power structure dominating society. Centuries before Dune, the Bene Gesserit would visit planets as missionaries and talk about saviors coming to rescue the people and set them free. They did this so effectively that modern day working people see the Bene Gesserit as holy saviors and witches. This is what Paul and Jessica exploit to gain the trust of the Fremen.\n\nWhat the Bene Gesserit actually do is have obscene control over their own bodies. They can read behavior in others, and command them with a hypnosis like power called The Voice. It's less magical and more like the Mentalist show or Psyche. Their goal is to breed the ruling class together to make a super person who can see into the future with such detail that they are able to change the course of history through their own actions. This is what the Kwisatz hadderach is. Making and controlling this person is important to keep the power structures of the universe intact.\n\nIt's a lot. And the book just throws you in the deep end with all these concepts.",

I decided to read the books again and have gotten a digital copy (though I really want to buy a paper version as well). I’m currently at page 135 and reading it after such a long time I might not remember everything but having read it before and knowing some of the stuff from before does make it easier. \n\nI had a whole conversation with my parents about the first part I’ve read so far and how some things are vague. \nI am giving it another go and I am loving reading it this time around.

You have the families like Harkannon and Atreides and the current ruling emperor who has the Sardakauer at his side, you have a ‘faith’ Bene Gesserit who in truth try to have control through their beliefs and operation, you have the Space Guild navigators who try to have control through controlling the movement of everyone in space and then there is CHOAM a means to control through wealth. Each of these groups will do anything to get power and Paul and his family are nothing but a pawn in the game they play.

The thing you have to understand is that the emperor has power, but that power is in part maintained through the use of his private and supposedly unrivaled military the Sardaukar. and the alliances among the houses of the Landsraad (essentially noble houses in with enough influence to have a vote in galactic matters). Duke Leto however has built a sizable military, and has a lot of loyalty and alliances among the Landsraad as well, enough that the Emperor see him as a challange to his will, and a threat to his rule. So he arranged to fuel the blood fued between the Harkonens and Atriedes, set it up to look like he was taking one of the most prestigeous positions as managers of the Planet Dune to Leto, painting a target on his back while doing so, and then offering the use of some of his elite private military to the Harkonens in their blood fued attack. Walk away having let somebody else clean the map off of a potential problem that you publically made a show of not only not feeling threatened by but had given a great gift to. And now nobody rivals him or undermines his power.\n\nCHOAM is where the voting of the Landsraad matters. all the noble houses have ownership in this (sort of like the stock market, sort of like Amazon, and sort of like OPEC) and shares count as votes to a degree, so that alliances between many small holders can given them abilities to disrupt economies of a mutual target. and since all trade goes through them in essence enough people hating you and pooling their votes can redirect resources and economic activity can lead to economic destruction, having to sell off share to keep your little Barony alive and thus losing votes and political influence.\n\nThe spice is in some ways like caffine (or more specifically things like tea, where empires conquer whole regions to gain the resource). It's frequently consumes in some form or other by everybody. It has a measurable effect on the body (in the case of the spice it can extend life, is medicinal in improving fitness and vitality, and heightens focus and thinking ability. All things that are sort of exagerations of things caffine does. But those who confume large amounts of it can become addicted (know somebody that absolutely cannot go a day without 3 Bang energy drinks, or an entire pot of coffee to drink throughout the day). Though in the case of the spice, cutting off an addict could actually kill them. The spice also expands consciousness enough that it can grant people visions. \n\nFaster than light travel exists but would be almost certain to be lethal, without either an advanced machine that can make the calculations and adaptive changes to course to prevent slamming into or through asteroids, comets and planets shifting around in space crossing your path all the time. But machines that think well enough to do that once overthrew and enslaved humanity. Humanity had a Jihad, and freed themselves from the machines and outlawed such things from ever being made again. So now the functions of such devices are done by humans who are trained mathmatics and reasoning wonders, whose minds are expanded with the spice (and mentats are known to use additional drugs to enhance their abilities). \n\nthe Spacing guild live in microgravity environments where so much spice fills the air that they breath that it dwarfs what the worst addict on any planet consumes. And they do it in part because the visions they get allow them to predict the whole trip of a ship, and thus know how to safely travel at faster than light speed without a computer. but living like that has also mutated them drastically. But they are the only way to safely travel or transport any goods from planet to planet.\n\nThe Bene Gesserit are a religeous sect of women, that are trained in understanding the body in the same way that a mentat understands numbers and logic. In the way you can hype yourself up or make yourself cry, they can control their entire body chemistry, and physical function. They can essentially make their body respond like it's given any prescription, and drug, any herbal supplement etc that they want (essentially it's like triggering a placebo effect  by using the training to convince your body to do certain things). And they have honed their talents to read body language, and physiological symptoms and (sherlock holmes like analysis) deduction from observation, to be able to detect lies, motivation, personal character etc. And to hieghten that even more they are trained in what to say and how to act in order to get more responses that tell them more and how to further manipulate others. thus they are very valued for negotiations, politics, economics and social. And they use this to 'sell' their members to powerful families as concubines, all with the secret goal to control the chemistry to breed more Bene Gesserit to breed more bloodlines toward generating both a political network of ties by blood, as well as a superbieng from the best of all the bloodlines, who will, with their training be able to do more than any of them have ever been able to do.",

And, while I understand common English names don’t usually fit in these types of worlds, is it really necessary to name every character like a Lovecraftian old god?  It distracts from the story if I have to spend 30 minutes trying to figure out how to say you main character’s name and then another 10 minutes for every side character. I’m not saying they should name their character John, but maybe don’t name characters based on Scrabble point value. And, throwing in a half dozen extra letters so you can make a unique spelling to circumvent the phonetical structure your readers bring to the table adds absolutely nothing to the story except for hurdles. Don’t use Ahlt’hohn when Alton will do.",

Sure its a good story in itself but you're clueless on who the heck are those characters, motivations and backstory. \n\nDune was like this, and I honestly thought I had bought the wrong book and missed a couple of ones. I did a google search and turns out everyone else \"suffered\" this, but is a right of passage. You're supposed to be confused bc the author doesn't give a fuck about you, and you know what? I'm so thankful for it. As others have said, you're supposed to BE Paul Atreides, you're supposed to learn everything just like he does. Way too many authors include some sort of exposition character to explain the world to us, the reader, but Herbert's exposition character is the world itself.\n\nMake no mistake, what YOU KNOW is what Paul knows. What you figure out is also when Paul figures out. The only thing in the series that I \"disliked\" was how Herbert tells us, right from the start, the thoughts and secrets of all the characters, not just the main one. I picked up Dune after finishing the Song of Ice and Fire, and I was used to have to piece myself all the secrets and double meanings that every character has, but Herbert tells you right from the start who's bad, who's the traitor, who's the hero.",

At some point AI gained sentience, and this resulted in an all out robot V. human war.\n\nAfter humans won the war they essentially made it universally illegal to develop any kind of artificial intelligence. This, in large part, explains the world. Why are we in this high-tech future, but people are fighting with sword and magic shields and shit instead of drones? Because drones don’t exist. In fact, basic calculation software doesn’t exist. It’s a manual mechanical future where all the jobs done by machines have been taken back into the hands of humans.\n\nWhy is the spice valuable? (and here’s the kicker) For the same reason. Without AI to run the calculations on their FTL drives, the human species would have been essentially cut off from itself. This is until they started using the spice.\n\nNow…how they use the spice is a bit mysterious, especially early in the book, but it’s easy to assume that some spacer gets high as shit on the stuff, and is somehow just barely able to perform all the duties of an advanced AI.\n\nIn conclusion for the generality: Space travel wouldn’t be possible without the spice. Without it the galactic economy would come to a screeching halt and every planet would be cut off from every other one.\n\nNow, the little things:\n\nThe Harkonenen V. Atreides thing is very deep and lore-full, but if you want to view it as a simple good Vs. Evil kind of thing, that is totally justifiable. The Harkonnen’s are very explicitly vile, and the Atreides are noble warriors.\n\nAs for Arrakis; Dune; Desert planet and its people there is just a whole bunch of lore, and you’ll be deep into it pretty soon, but you could justifiably wrap your mind around it by thinking in terms of the colonization of America. A bunch of natives, completely adapted to their world, are faced with a colonizing force of unprecedented power coming in to plunder the planets resources. Bad stuff. Don’t do a colonization.\n\nThe Spice:\n\nIt’s basically magic. Opens up the mind, unlocks very improbable powers of the human brain. Basically makes you a Jedi.\n\nIt’s Jedi shit.",
